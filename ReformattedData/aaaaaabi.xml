Despite recent government funded health promotion targeting Maori, this disparity appears to be widening. Smoking prevalence rates for Pakeha New Zealanders continue to fall, whereas Maori smoking prevalence rates remain stable at 50% of all Maori adults over the age of 15. In response to community demand for smoking cessation assistance, some Maori health providers developed a residential intervention based on marae. This study examined the effectiveness of that approach to aiding smoking cessation among Maori. A secondary purpose of the study was to support the development of uniquely Maori approaches to research, by utilising a kaupapa Maori methodology. The literature on kaupapa Maori health research methodology was reviewed. Consequently, Te Whare Tapa Wha, a contemporary Maori paradigm is used as the central organising framework for analysing and understanding both the act of research and smoking behaviour. Two groups of smokers were interviewed, a group undertaking a Noho Marae smoking cessation programme (n=26) and a group of unaided quitters (n=104). Participants were interviewed prior to their quit attempt and again four months later. Nineteen of the unaided quitters were lost to follow-up. Both quantitative and qualitative data was collected. Few significant differences existed between the groups at the first interview. Among participants who completed both interviews, point prevalence at follow-up was 35% for the Noho Marae group versus 14% for the unaided group. The findings support the effectiveness of Noho Marae smoking cessation interventions. Recommendations on how to strengthen New Zealand's tobacco control programme are made. A greater emphasis on delivering to whanau, rather than focusing interventions on individuals, is recommended. Priority is currently given to groups identified as having higher smoking rates. Decline in smoking prevalence may be hastened by identifying and serving the groups most ready to change smoking behaviour. Further research is indicated, for example, to better understand the smoking cessation needs of pregnant Maori women.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3159</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluation of clinical outcome measures for children with cerebral palsy</field><field name="creator">Mackey, Anna H</field><field name="description">There are a lack of reliable and valid clinical outcome measures to assess the effects of medical interventions in children with cerebral palsy, potentially compromising research and clinical practice in this area. The objective of this thesis was to identify and develop reliable outcome measures that could be used to evaluate the effects of botulinum toxin A in children with cerebral palsy. Six studies were undertaken in both normative and cerebral palsy populations to address this aim. Two studies investigated the reliability and validity of commonly used measures of lower limb function; three-dimensional gait analysis and visual gait assessment. Four studies investigated measures of upper limb function in children with cerebral palsy. An objective three-dimensional measure of upper limb function was developed and used to examine the reliability and validity of additional upper limb measures of muscle tone and arm function and to complete an objective assessment of upper limb botulinum toxin use in this population. The results demonstrated that three-dimensional and visual gait analyses are reliable and valid measures for children with cerebral palsy. For the upper limb this work has resulted in the development of an objective and reliable three-dimensional kinematic measure of upper limb function. A reliability assessment of the modified Tardieu scale found this measure to have poor reliability in detecting dynamic muscle tone in children with cerebral palsy, indicating limited value as a research tool. The results of the pilot study examining upper limb botulinum toxin A use in a group of ten children with hemiplegia, found small functional gains following treatment, as determined by the three-dimensional kinematic measure and Melbourne Assessment. These two measures were found to have moderate agreement in the determination of range of motion during specific upper limb functional tasks. This work has established the reliability and validity of a range of measures appropriate for use in children with cerebral palsy. The use of valid and reliable outcome measures provides a greater understanding of the complexities of cerebral palsy and ultimately will lead to improved outcome and greater treatment opportunities for families and children with cerebral palsy.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3160</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A finite element model of myocardial structure: implications for electrical activation in the heart</field><field name="creator">Le Grice, Ian John</field><field name="description">We have developed a mathematical representation of ventricular geometry and myocardial architecture using a three-dimensional finite element model which incorporates new information on the layered organization of cardiac muscle cells in ventricular myocardium. This model has been used to make a detailed and quantitative comparison of cardiac geometry and fibre organization. Extensive geometric measurements were made in dog hearts arrested in diastole and fixed at zero transmural pressure. These measurements included: ventricular epicardial and endocardial surface geometry (25 hearts), muscle fibre orientations (6 hearts), epicardial coronary vessels (24 hearts), and the specialized conduction system (3 hearts). A finite element mesh was fitted to geometric data for each heart and was shown to provide a faithful representation of the ventricular surfaces. RMS fitting errors were: epicardium 0.75 &#177; 0.18 mm, RV endocardium 1.75 &#177; 0.36 mm, and LV endocardium 1.24 &#177; 0.30 mm (with an appropriately refined mesh). Comparison of coronal cross-sections generated from the meshes demonstrated that ventricular shape is very consistent for hearts of similar size. Myocardial fibre fields were fitted to fibre orientation data and compared at matched sites. The fibre fits were shown to be within the range of measurement error. At equivalent sites fibre fields showed consistent regional differences in transmural fibre angle variation. Comparison of the geometric data revealed very similar patterns of both coronary vessel topology and Purkinje fibre distribution. Two further dog hearts were arrested and fixed as outlined above, and ventricular geometry was measured. The ventricular walls were subdivided into radial base-apex segments from which thick (100 &#181;m) sections were cut. Simple digital imaging procedures were used to characterize the macroscopic organization revealed in a) transmural and b) serial tangential thick sections. These studies confirm that ventricular myocardium is a discrete laminar structure rather than a uniformly branching continuum as has previously been believed. In the transmural plane, myocardial sheets run from endocardium to epicardium in a characteristic pattern which varies at different ventricular sites. It has also been shown that the extent of coupling between adjacent myocardial layers varies transmurally with more extensive interconnections between layers in the subepicardial and subendocardial regions than in the midwall. Our finite element model of cardiac anatomy has been extended to incorporate a representation of the laminar organization of ventricular myocardium. The refined model provides a very good representation of our experimental myocardial sheet data (RMS fitting error = 27&#176;). Finally we review the approaches to modelling electrical activity in the heart and demonstrate the use of our model in studies of ventricular activation.</field><field name="date">1992</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3162</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The gallbladder epithelium in experimental cholelithiasis</field><field name="creator">Lee, Sum Ping</field><field name="description">1. The behaviour of the gallbladder epithelium in three models of experimental cholelithiasis has been studied. The models are : (a) rabbits when fed a lithogenic diet containing 0.75% dihydrocholesterol for 7 days (b) mice when fed a lithogenic diet containing 1% cholesterol and 0.5% cholic acid for 42 days, and (c) guinea pigs when given subcutaneous injections of Lincomycin (60 mg/kg) for 7 days. 2. The morphological changes in the gallbladder epithelium during gallstone formation have been studied with light microscopy and autoradiography. In all three models, there was a marked increase in cell proliferation early in the lithogenic process before stones were formed. Epithelial dysplasia was common. In the mouse and guinea pig, these cellular proliferative and dysplastic changes progressed to metaplasia with new gland formation. 3. The quantitative and qualitative presence of mucus (glycoproteins) in the gallbladder epithelium has been studied by glycoprotein histochemistry of microscopic sections, by scanning and transmission electron microscopy, and by chemical extraction and analysis of the monosaccharide radicles of the soluble glycoproteins. In all three models, a progressive increase in histochemical staining reaction in the epithelial cells was observed and commenced at a time before stones were formed. Results of the electron microscopic studies supported the histochemical study and in addition, demonstrated the presence of increased amounts of mucus droplets in the subapical zones of gallbladder epithelial cells. Extraction and chemical analysis of the soluble glycoproteins showed a quantitative increase in the glycoprotein content of the gallbladder, starting before stones were formed and persisted to when stones had formed. Both the histochemical and the chemical studies failed to demonstrate a qualitative difference in the mucus produced at different stages. 4. Fluid transport across the gallbladder mucosa has been quantitated by an in vitro preparation (Diamond 1964) in the rabbit and the guinea pig models- In both models, there was an increase in the rate of fluid transport detectable before stones were formed, and returned to normal values when stones were formed and after the lithogenic treatment was stopped.</field><field name="date">1977</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3178</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mechanisms of cell death in Alzheimer's disease</field><field name="creator">MacGibbon, Geraldine Anne</field><field name="description">Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, which is characterised clinically by dementia and progressive memory loss, and pathologically by neuronal degeneration, plaques (insoluble &#946;-amyloid (A&#946;) protein) and neurofibrillary lesions (abnormally phosphorylated tau protein). The mechanisms by which cells die in AD remain largely unknown and controversial. There is some evidence to suggest that cell death in AD brains may occur by apoptosis, and that A&#946; might be involved in this process. Apoptosis, a type of cell death characterised by distinct morphological and biochemical features, is often the result of 'programmed cell death' (PCD). Many gene families have been proposed to be involved in the PCD pathway, including the caspase family, inducible transcription factor (ITF) family (including Jun, Fos and Krox genes), and members of the Bcl-2 gene family (including the death promoting gene Bax). It is possible, therefore, that some of these genes may play a role in cell death in AD. The hippocampus is one of the first regions of the brain to be affected in AD, showing cell loss mainly in the CA1-2 pyramidal cell layer. In this thesis, the hippocampus from AD and Control cases has been examined for markers of apoptosis and genes thought to be involved in PCD. In addition, the actions of A&#946;, human amylin (a structurally similar protein to A&#946;) and the A&#946; precursor protein (APP) have been examined in cell culture in an attempt to elucidate their mechanisms of action and relate this to the pathogenesis of AD. AD hippocampi showed increased DNA fragmentation as assessed by TdT-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labelling (TUNEL), but TUNEL-positive cells in AD generally did not exhibit 'typical' apoptotic morphology, and there was no evidence of the oligonucleosomal DNA fragmentation characteristic of apoptosis. This indicates that 'typical' apoptosis may not be the predominant cell death mechanism in AD. However, there was some evidence of atypical 'broken' nuclei, which may represent a form of apoptosis that presents with a different morphology in aging tissue. This study found no conclusive evidence of increased expression of Fos or Jun family members in the CA1 region of AD hippocampi, however there were increased levels of the putative 'apoptosis-specific protein' and krox24 mRNA in this area which could be related to the cell death. There was no change in Bax expression in the CA1 region of AD brains (although increased Bax expression was observed in this region in a rat hypoxic-ischemia model where the CA1 neurons die by apoptosis). However, there was a decrease in Bax expression in the granule cells of AD hippocampi which could be related to the relative preservation of these cells in AD. Bax and ITF expression was observed in tangles, senile plaques and Hirano bodies in AD hippocampi, which may be related to the formation of these features and/or the pathogenesis of AD. There appeared to be changes in the cellular location of proteins in post-mortem tissue that made determination of ITF levels extremely difficult. In addition, patterns of ITF expression differed when different antisera directed at the same protein were used. These observations indicate that caution must be exercised when studying protein changes in post-mortem tissue. Application of insoluble A&#946; to cultured cells, and overexpression of APP or familial AD-linked APP mutants in cultured cells, did not cause toxicity or alter c-Jun gene expression. However, human amylin was toxic to cultured cells, and had different effects on c-Jun gene expression depending on the cell type. This shows that structurally similar proteins do not always act by a similar mechanism, and that care must be taken when choosing a cell culture system to study disease-related events. The finding that neither insoluble A&#946; nor APP/AD-linked APP mutants caused acute toxicity to cultured cells, coupled with the lack of relationship between TUNEL staining and A&#946; deposits in post-mortem AD tissue, indicates that deposited insoluble A&#946; and/or increased amounts of A&#946; may not represent the toxic event in AD. This thesis provides a detailed investigation of several factors that could be involved in the cell death process in the hippocampus in AD. The results presented find no conclusive evidence for &#8216;classical&#8217; apoptosis and/or increased ITF expression in the hippocampus in AD, but the changes in expression of krox24 mRNA, &#8216;apoptosis-specific protein&#8217; and Bax suggest that programmed cell death may well be a mechanism which is involved in the pathogenesis of AD.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::320500 Pharmacology and Pharmaceutical Sciences::320503 Clinical pharmacology and therapeutics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3164</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The studies of novel regulators of bone cell function</field><field name="creator">Lin, Jian-Ming</field><field name="description">The current study investigates novel factors in bone cell biology by using both in vitro and in vivo models. The results show that murine receptor activator of nuclear factor-KB ligand (muRANKL) and rat RANKL (rRANKL) stimulated, while human osteoprotegerin (hOPG) inhibited, 45Ca release and [3H]-thymidine incorporation in rat calvarial organ cultures, osteoclastogenesis from mouse bone marrow cultures and bone resorption in rat isolated mature osteoclast assays. Interestingly, truncated rRANKL(246-318) became an antagonist for non-truncated rRANKL in isolated osteoclast assays. Fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-8a at 25 ng/mL or greater potently stimulated osteoblast proliferation and mildly inhibited osteoblast differentiation. An autocrine mechanism may be involved in the regulation of osteoblasts based on detection of the expression of FGF-8 in these cells. Osteoclastogenesis was significantly reduced by FGF-8a at 0.05&#8212; 25 ng/mL, while the ratio of RANKL/OPG was elevated by this agent. &#945;-melanocyte stimulating hormone (&#945;-MSH) markedly stimulated both osteoblast proliferation (at 10-9 M or greater) and osteoclastogenesis (at 10-8 M or greater) in vitro. The stimulatory effect on osteoclasts was associated with the increased ratio of RANKL/OPG. Systemic administration of &#945;-MSH resulted in a decrease in trabecular volume in tibiae. &#945;-MSH also stimulated canine chondrocyte proliferation, but had no direct interaction with mature osteoclasts. Milk basic fraction (MBF)-1, MBF-2, milk acidic fraction (MAF)-1 and MAF-2 were found to be mitogenic to osteoblasts in vitro. While MAF-1 inhibited and MAF-2 stimulated bone resorption in calvarial cultures, the peptic hydrolysates of the both fractions showed inhibitory effects in this model. Among the individual components identified from the milk fractions, lactoferrin was found to be an interesting novel anabolic factor, potently stimulating osteoblast proliferation at 1-10 &#181;g/mL or greater in both isolated osteoblast and calvarial organ cultures, as well as potently inhibiting osteoclast formation from bone marrow cells via a RANKL/OPG-independent mechanism. In summary, this study has revealed the possibility of the development of a RANKL antagonist through truncation of the molecule. In addition, the osteoblastic and osteoclastic effects of FGF-8a, &#945;-MSH and lactoferrin have been demonstrated for the first time. However, further study is still needed to better understand the mechanisms of their functioning and to evaluate their potential for clinical application.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3181</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The structure, regulation and function of the leukocyte &#946;7 integrins and CG-1</field><field name="creator">Leung, Euphemia Yee Fun</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the structure, regulation and function of the leukocyte &#946;7 integrins and a novel mouse protein termed CG-1. Members of the integrin family of adhesion molecules are involved in cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions, and play fundamental roles in diverse biological processes. The &#946;7 integrins (LPAM-1, HML-1 and M290) appear to play a special role in mucosal immunity and inflammation. They bind to cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) including MAdCAM-1, VCAM-1 and fibronectin which are expressed on inflamed endothelia and epithelia, and thereby contribute to the processes of leukocyte emigration and retention. An analysis of the &#946;7 gene promoter was undertaken to understand the regulation of expression of the &#946;7 integrins on different leukocyte subtypes. Primer extension and rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) analysis revealed that the start of transcription was confined to nucleotide positions +1 and +4. The 5&#8217; site contains the highly conserved CA motif found at the transcriptional initiation sites of eukaryotic genes. Transient transfection assays revealed that a small 292bp 5&#8217;-flanking region of the &#946;7 gene is responsible for cell-specific transcription. This promoter appears to be very compact with an array of potential and often overlapping cis-elements clustered around the transcription start site. The types of cis-elements in the &#946;7 gene promoter are reminiscent of those found in the transcriptional enhancers of the TCR, CD3, integrin &#945;4 subunit, and integrin Leu-CAM genes, in accord with the predominantly leukocyte-restricted distribution of the &#946;7 integrins in normal cells. However, proximal promoter activity was quite weak, and it is likely that distal enhancer elements are required to drive expression of the &#946;7 gene. The presence of an enhancer region located between nucleotide positions -690 and -397 was detected by both deletion analysis and DNase I hypersensitivity assay using the EL4 cell line. Functional studies of the trans-acting factors which bind the cis-acting elements contained within the &#946;7 promoter will aid in unravelling the signals imparted to leukocytes in blood vessels and in gut-associated lymphoid tissues that regulate M290/HML-1 and LPAM-1 expression. CG-1 is a coiled-coil leukocyte protein that is characterized by having extensive heptad repeats. It is immunologically related to, associated with, or identical to CD100, a cell surface antigen which shares a costimulatory function with integrins. CD100 influences the proliferation and differentiation of immune cells. Complementary DNAs encoding the mouse homologue of CG-1 were obtained by screening various mouse cDNA libraries with a human CG-1 cDNA probe. The deduced amino acid (aa) sequence of mouse CG-1 displays 83% identity with the human homologue, and the coiled-coil regions have been stringently conserved. CG-1 transcripts are expressed in a diverse range of cell lines and tissues, and are not restricted to haematopoietic cells. A complex pattern of insertions and/or deletions within CG-1 RNAs was revealed by comparison of the sequences of various mouse cDNA clones isolated from different cells and tissues. The deduced amino acid sequences of mouse and human CG-1 are similar to the sequence of the chicken cardiac morphogenic protein ES/L30, suggesting that CG-1 and ES/130 are potentially related members of a gene family.</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3184</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Superantigens as vaccine delivery vehicles for the generation of cellular immune responses</field><field name="creator">Loh, Mei San</field><field name="description">The constant battle between pathogen and host has led to substantial diversity and adaptability of the host immune system. Pathogens too, have evolved unique mechanisms to evade their hosts. The production of superantigens is one of these mechanisms. Superantigens are potent T cell mitogens that have the unique ability to bind simultaneously to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules and T cell receptors (TCRs). The resulting uncontrolled activation of up to 20% of all T cells and the subsequent cytokine release, can lead to fever, shock and death. Superantigens are not processed intracellularly like conventional antigens but instead bind as intact proteins to MHC class II molecules expressed on the surface of professional antigen presenting cells. On the hypothesis that the unique properties of superantigens may serve useful for vaccine delivery, several bacterial superantigens were selectively mutated at their TCR-binding site with the ultimate goal of creating a safe, non-toxic carrier protein that could target antigen presenting cells by binding to MHC class II. Antigen presenting cells that expressed MHC class II were indeed targeted by the TCR-binding-deficient superantigens. Cellular internalisation of the superantigen into vesicles was observed as early as 30 min. These supcrantigens were also shown to traffic to, and be captured by, the lymph nodes of immunised mice. Using TCR-binding-deficicnt superantigens as vaccine carrier proteins, enhanced antigenicity and immunogenicity of the conjugated MHC class I-restricted peptide antigen. GP33, was observed in a mouse model. In vitro studies revealed up to 200-fold enhancement of antigenicity when GP33 was conjugated to superantigen. Enhanced immunogenicity was also observed in vivo, with conjugates providing protection against Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infection after only a single immunisation. These results indicate that modified superantigens are able to safely deliver peptides for cross-presentation, and may serve as a novel mechanism for vaccine delivery.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321000 Clinical Sciences::321020 Pathology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3161</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Conceptualising boys (and) video gaming: "Communities of Practice"?</field><field name="creator">Robertson, Jennifer D.</field><field name="description">The present investigation aimed to apply Wenger&#8217;s (1998) conceptualisation of the &#8216;communities of practice&#8217; concept (being one concept within the broader framework of social learning theory) to video gaming, based on Gee&#8217;s (2003) suggestion that video gaming could be viewed as a &#8216;community of practice&#8217;. In addition, Paechter&#8217;s (2003a) recommendation that masculinities (after Connell, 1995, and inclusive of a Foucaultian notion of knowledge/power relations), could be additionally conceptualised as &#8216;communities of masculinities practice&#8217; was explored in relation to video gaming. The choice of &#8216;communities of practice&#8217; as the unifying concept for this study was favoured due to the application of the concept to a number of New Zealand, Ministry of Education initiatives. The research project aimed to evaluate the usefulness of the &#8216;communities of practice&#8217; concept for application to boys (and) video gaming as a model for how the concept might be applied to a range of education-related social learning environments. A total of 284 Year 9 boys (13-14 years old), from five New Zealand schools were surveyed about their video gaming behaviours and understandings, and further 42 boys from a selection of these same schools took part in &#8216;lessons&#8217; to discuss in detail aspects of their video gaming. Evidence supported that; video gaming in itself cannot be conceptualised as a &#8216;community of practice&#8217; because there is no sense of mutual engagement in a joint enterprise in the playing of video games, (that was, there is no evidence to support the conceptual understanding of &#8216;community&#8217; or &#8216;practice&#8217;); and in addition, that while masculinities can be convincingly conceptualised as &#8216;communities of practice&#8217;, it is only when the activity of video gaming is seen as a resource within the shared repertoire of the &#8216;communities of masculinities practice&#8217;, in which masculinities, both hegemonic and less hegemonic are performed and reproduced, that video gaming can be linked with the &#8216;communities of practice&#8217; concept. The implications of the findings are discussed in relation to where the conceptual and analytical lens offered by the &#8216;communities of practice&#8217; concept, appear to be more applicable to the world of boys and video gaming. Also reiterated is that romanticised notions of &#8216;community&#8217;, applied to the likes of an educational environment but devoid of conceptual foundation, can be little more than rhetoric when not carefully considered and supported by empirical evidence.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education::330100 Education Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3300</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sympathetic neural control of renal blood flow</field><field name="creator">Leonard, Bridget Louise</field><field name="description">Renal sympathetic nerve activity (RSNA) plays an important role in the control of renal hemodynamics and function. It achieves this control by changing the mean levels of activity and/or changing the power of the distinct frequencies that comprise this mean activity. My studies, presented in four parts, investigate how total renal blood flow (RBF) and intrarenal blood flow are controlled by these changes in RSNA. While RSNA and RBF both show oscillations at various frequencies, the functional significance and regulation of these oscillations is not well understood. To establish whether the strength of these oscillations is under differential control I measured the frequency spectrum of RSNA and RBF following volume expansion in conscious rabbits. At least 6 days prior to experiments animals underwent surgery to implant an electrode for recording renal nerve activity and a flow probe for recording RBF. Volume expansion resulted in a 25 &#177; 5% decrease in mean RSNA, paralleled by an increase in RBF. Renal denervated rabbits did not show an increase in RBF with volume expansion. Spectral analysis of the different frequencies in RSNA showed oscillations in RSNA between 0.2 to 0.4 Hz were selectively decreased following volume expansion (14 &#177; 3 to 6&#177;1% of total power in RSNA at &lt; 3Hz). A corresponding decrease in the strength of oscillations in RBF at this frequency was also seen (20 &#177; 6 to 8 &#177; 2%). In contrast the strength of respiratory (0.8 to 2.0 Hz) and cardiac (3 to 6 Hz) related rhythms did not change with volume expansion. These results show that selective changes in the different frequency components of RSNA can occur. While RSNA plays a significant role in the regulation of RBF, little is known about the role renal nerves may play in the control of regional kidney blood flows i.e. cortical and medullary blood flow (CBF and MBF respectively). This is an important question as the control of blood flow to the renal medulla has been shown to be critical in the long-term control of arterial pressure, chiefly through its influence on tubular reabsorption of salt and water. If renal nerves are involved in the control of medullary blood flow then they may also have a role in long-term arterial pressure regulation. My aim was to investigate the role RSNA may have in the regulation of both CBF and MBF. In a series of experiments, using pentobarbitone anaesthetized rabbits, I electrically stimulated the renal nerves whilst simultaneously recording RBF, CBF, and MBF. Three sequences of stimulation were applied, 1) varying the amplitude of stimulation, 2) varying the frequency of stimulation and 3) stimulation with a modulated sinusoidal pattern which allows determination of the frequency response characteristics of each flow. Increasing amplitude or frequency of stimulation progressively decreased all flow variables. RBF and CBF responded similarly, but MBF responded less. For example, 0.5 V stimulation decreased CBF by 20 &#177; 9% but MBF fell by only 4 &#177; 6%. The amplitude of oscillations in all flow variables was progressively reduced as the frequency of sinusoidal stimulation was increased. An increased amplitude of oscillation was observed at 0.12 and 0.32 Hz in MBF, and to a lesser extent RBF, but not CBF. MBF therefore appears to be less sensitive than CBF to the magnitude of RSNA, but more able to respond to these higher frequencies of neural stimulation. These results show that regional renal blood flows may be differentially regulated by RSNA and indicate a role for RSNA in the control of MBF. To further investigate the effects of RSNA on intrarenal blood flow I performed another series of experiments in which I reflexly increased RSNA while simultaneously recording CBF and MBF. I exposed pentobarbitone anesthetized, artificially ventilated rabbits to graded reductions in inspired 02 content. A separate group of animals with denervated kidneys underwent the same protocol. Graded hypoxia (16, 14, 12 and 10% inspired 02) progressively reduced arterial 02 partial pressure and increased RSNA (by 8 &#177; 3, 44 &#177; 25, 62 &#177; 21 and 76 &#177; 37% respectively compared with air) without affecting MAP. This was accompanied by progressive reductions in CBF (by 2 &#177; 1, 5 &#177; 2, 11 &#177; 3 and 14 &#177; 2% respectively) in intact but not denervated rabbits. MBF was unaffected by hypoxia in either group. Thus, reflex increases in RSNA cause renal cortical vasoconstriction, but not at vascular sites regulating MBF. Taken together results from both these studies provide strong evidence that MBF is less sensitive to the vasoconstrictor influence of RSNA than is CBF. However, larger, chronic increases in RSNA, such as occur in heart failure, could be associated with decreases in MBF. This may implicate RSNA in the long-term control of arterial pressure. The 0.3 Hz oscillation in RSNA, and thus MAP, is intermittent in its presence. In a final series of experiments I studied the underlying reasons for the presence or absence of the 0.3 Hz oscillation. Using conscious animals I studied the oscillation under a range of sympathetic stimulants. I was unable to induce an oscillation in MAP at 0.3 Hz and propose reasons for this. To allow further analysis, I performed a second set of experiments in which I induced the oscillation in RBF by electrical stimulation of the aortic depressor nerve. I found that large amplitude oscillations in baroreceptor stimulation were required to induce oscillations in RBF and MAP. I speculate on what this may tell us about the nature of the slow oscillation.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::320600 Medical Physiology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3182</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Understanding leukaemogenesis: towards identification of leukaemia enhancers and suppressors through zebrafish genetics</field><field name="creator">Kalev-Zylinska, Maggie Lucy</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3183</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Art education in New Zealand: issues of culture, diversity and difference</field><field name="creator">Smith, Jill (Jill Elizabeth)</field><field name="description">New Zealand is becoming increasingly multicultural and its school population progressively diverse. Ministry of Education policy documents present policy and curriculum direction which acknowledge the value of New Zealand's bicultural identity and multicultural society. These policies impact on the field investigated, secondary school art education. Developed under the influence of neo-liberal political theory, which emphasises economic sustainability rather than principles of social justice, they raise issues of the position and value of art education in the contemporary age of globalisation. Cultural theorists claim that schooling has a responsibility to educate for an equitable democratic society. Multicultural art education theorists argue that art education can make a significant contribution towards democratic practices. Evident in the literature from within New Zealand is critical, theoretical and philosophical debate on the framing of the arts curriculum and its socio-political and cultural contexts. There is no evidence, however, of practical investigation into how secondary school art teachers are interpreting and implementing the visual arts discipline in the arts curriculum or exploring the underlying issues of cultural diversity in an increasingly multiculturalised society. The thesis is underpinned by a critique of interpretations of culture, diversity and difference, an interrogation of pedagogical practices for culturally inclusive art education, and a critical analysis of curriculum policy. The research investigated, through case study fieldwork in secondary schools, the extent to which policy and curriculum directives and art education practice take into account the ethnic diversity and cultural differences of students from diverse cultures living in a contemporary globalised world.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3171</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Insulin-like growth factors in the ischaemic heart</field><field name="creator">Matthews, Kenneth George</field><field name="description">Cardiac muscle has very limited ability to regenerate following injury. Loss of muscle due to myocardial infarction (MI) is therefore compensated for by hypertrophy of the surviving cardiac muscle. Deposition of inflexible scar tissue in the infarct zone leads to subsequent dysfunction of the heart, often culminating in chronic morbidity and eventual death due to heart failure. Insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) and insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II) are members of a family of insulin-related peptides involved in tissue development, repair and replacement. Their involvement in these roles has been clearly demonstrated in skeletal muscle, but remains unclear in cardiac muscle. The aim of this thesis, therefore, was to undertake a comprehensive evaluation of the insulin-like growth factor axis following induced MI in sheep, in order to determine the relationship between time-based changes in the myocardium and insulin-like growth factor levels, and subsequently to determine the therapeutic effect of GH or IGF-I treatment on cardiac function following MI. To achieve the aims of the thesis, a model of MI was developed from the existing cardiology technique of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. Using this model, MI was induced in adult ewes by selected coronary artery occlusion under fluoroscopic guidance. Subsequently, the model was further developed into one of stable heart failure, utilising serial microembolisations targeted by echocardiography. Results showed that, in the cardiomyocytes bordering the infarct, IGF-I mRNA, protein and receptor binding increased, whereas IGF-II mRNA and protein levels did not vary, although IGF-II receptor binding increased. Following these findings, IGF-I levels were manipulated by subcutaneous injections of either growth hormone or IGF-I, and by intra-pericardial IGF-I delivery via catheter. Results showed that neither growth hormone nor subcutaneous IGF-I were able to effect an improvement in cardiac function, although there were indications that a longer duration of treatment with subcutaneous IGF-I might have done so. Intra-pericardial IGF-I, however, resulted in a significant and sustained improvement in cardiac function. In conclusion, surviving cardiomyocytes at the infarct border show marked changes in IGF-I localisation, production and specific binding, indicating that IGF-I is directly involved in post-infarct events, possibly in the maintenance of cardiac function by the induction of hypertrophy. Delivery of IGF-I directly into the pericardium results in a significant improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction which is sustained after cessation of treatment. Such a result indicates that IGF-I may have a role as a therapy in the failing heart.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3172</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A mutation in the gene encoding osteoprotegerin causes the severe bone disease Idiopathic Hyperphosphatasia</field><field name="creator">Middleton-Hardie, Catherine</field><field name="description">Genetic analysis of a large family with Familial Idiopathic Hyperphosphatasia, a rare autosomal recessive bone disease, identified linkage to a region of chromosome 8q that contains the gene for osteoprotegerin (OPG), a key regulator of bone remodelling. Sequencing of this gene in members of the family identified an in-frame 3 base pair deletion resulting in the deletion of an aspartate residue at position 182, within the critical TNF-receptor-like region. Wild-type and mutant OPG cDNA were cloned into pcDNA3.1(-)/myc-His vector and expressed in HEK293 cells. Conditioned media samples containing the recombinant proteins were tested for their ability to inhibit bone resorption in a neonatal murine calvarial organ culture. Conditioned medium containing wild type OPG (wtOPG) inhibited bone resorption, whereas the conditioned medium containing the mutant protein (OPG&#8710;D182) had no effect. Subsequently, the peptides were tested in a murine bone marrow osteoclastogenesis system. In this assay, OPG&#8710;D182 had significantly lower activity than wtOPG. These results indicate the deletion of aspartate 182 impairs the ability of OPG to inhibit osteoclast formation and activation. The ability of wtOPG and OPG&#8710;D182 to bind RANKL has been investigated using a rRANKL-GST pulldown system. These experiments demonstrated the OPG&#8710;D182 had reduced ability to bind RANKL compared to wtOPG. A kinetic study using the surface plasmon resonance technology of BIAcore&#8482; revealed the RANKL binding affinity of OPG&#8710;D182 is lower than that of wtOPG. Altered processing of OPG&#8710;D182 causes hyperglycosylation in comparison to wtOPG. Glycosylation was shown to be important for the function of full-length OPG, probably due to a requirement of glycosylation for correct folding. Site-directed mutagenesis identified two glycosylation sites that contribute to the hyperglycosylation of OPG&#8710;D182. Glycosylation at one of these sites has potential structural implications by preventing disulphide bond formation and correct protein domain folding. The research highlights the effects of a single amino acid deletion on the structure and function of OPG. The deletion of aspartate 182 is a detrimental mutation that results in the severe phenotype seen in the patients, confirming the crucial role of OPG in normal bone physiology in humans.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3173</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterisation of ryanodine receptor expression in the rat cochlea</field><field name="creator">Morton-Jones, Rachel</field><field name="description">Increases in intracellular Ca2+ play a central role in cochlear function. The ryanodine receptor (RyR) intracellular Ca2+ release channel, a ubiquitous element of Ca2+ signalling, has been implicated in the regulation of sound transduction and auditory neurotransmission. Despite this, the molecular basis underlying RyR-mediated Ca2+ signalling in the cochlea has been limited. This thesis investigates the molecular and functional characterisation of RyR expression in the cochlea. RT-PCR analysis showed expression of RyR1, RyR2 and RyR3 isoform mRNA transcripts in the rat cochlea and also in the spiral ganglion. Localisation of RyR protein revealed differential expression of these isoforms in the cochlea. Strong RyR immunolabelling for RyR1, RyR2 and RyR3 were detected in the spiral ganglion neuron (SGN) cell bodies. RyR3 labelling extended to the synaptic terminals innervating the inner and outer hair cells. RyR2 expression also occurred in the inner hair cells and supporting cells of the organ of Corti. Cells associated with ion homeostasis in the cochlea were also labelled, including RyR1 in spiral limbus interdental cells, and RyR2 and RyR3 in spiral prominence epithelial cells and stria vascularis basal cells. In the SGN cell bodies, confocal imaging of Ca2+ store release confirmed the presence of a functional RyR-gated Ca2+ store. Superfusion of glutamate and &#945;-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA) evoked large Ca2+ responses in the SGN cell bodies that were dependent upon Ca2+ entry. However, subsequent depletion of SGN RyR-gated Ca2+ stores substantially reduced the glutamate- and AMPA-induced Ca2+ responses, demonstrating that the majority of the Ca2+ signal derived from RyR-gated Ca2+ stores via Ca2+ -induced Ca2+ release. Involvement of the AMPA/Kainate-type glutamate receptor was confirmed by elimination of glutamate- and AMPA-induced Ca2+ responses with an AMPA/Kainate receptor antagonist. These findings support a role for RyR in the regulation of auditory neurotransmission, sound transduction and cochlear electrochemical homeostasis. These data also demonstrate coupling between somatic AMPA-type glutamate receptors and RyR-gated Ca2+ stores, which is likely to influence auditory neurotransmission.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::320600 Medical Physiology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3186</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Pathophysiology of fetal asphyxia: factors that influence the severity and distribution of neuronal damage</field><field name="creator">Mallard, Eva Carina</field><field name="description">Perinatal asphyxia is thought to be a major cause of subsequent neurological deficits. Pathological studies suggest that many of these events occur before birth. However, the relationship between specific prenatal events and neurological outcome is not clear. This thesis tested the hypothesis that certain fetal factors play a role in determining the severity and distribution of neuronal loss following in utero asphyxia. Chronically instrumented fetal sheep at three different gestational ages; midgestation (90d), late-gestation (120-130d) or near term (&gt; 135d) were subjected to either a single or repeated insult. The insult consisted of an episode of either systemic asphyxia (umbilical cord occlusion) or cerebral ischaemia (carotid artery occlusion). The fetal parietal cortical electroencephalogram (EEG), cortical impedance (CI) indicating intracellular edema, blood pressure (MAP), electrocardiogram (ECG) and frequent fetal blood gases and metabolites were measured. Three days after the insult, histopathological analysis or immunohistochemistry was performed to determine neuronal loss and specific neurotransmitters respectively. Transient (10min) occlusion of the umbilical cord in late-gestation fetuses, resulted in severe fetal asphyxia, hypotension (24&#177;5mmHg, p&lt;0.01), bradycardia (72&#177;14bpm, p&lt;0.001), depressed EEG activity (-17&#177;2dB, p&lt;0.001) and intracellular edema. The intracellular edema resolved within 27&#177;6min, whereas the EEG activity was depressed for 5&#177;2h, despite rapid recovery of pO2. Neither seizures or infarction were observed. The degree of hypotension, increase in CI, lactate and recovery of post-asphyxial EEG intensity were more marked in 135d fetuses compared with the midgestation fetus (p&lt;0.01). Neuronal loss, which was only observed in the older group, was predominantly in the hippocampus and associated with the severity of hypotension during occlusion. Repeated episodes of cerebral ischaemia, altered the distribution of neuronal loss compared with single insults, inducing damage mainly in the striatum. The frequency of the insults determined the severity of the damage. Similarly, recurrent episodes of fetal asphyxia induced predominantly striatal neuronal loss. Each occlusion resulted in fetal hypoxia and bradycardia accompanied by increased T/QRS ratio as noted on the ECG. Progressively severe hypotension and lactic acidosis developed during successive occlusions. The EEG was depressed and CI increased with each occlusion. After the asphyxial episodes, blood pressure and heart rate returned to normal, while the T wave was inverted for 310&#177;60min. The EEG remained depressed for 90&#177;10min and intermittent seizures developed at 3.3&#177;0.6h after the last occlusion. The extent of neuronal loss correlated with the degree of hypotension, increase in T/QRS ratio, duration of post-asphyxial EEG depression and number of seizures. Immunohistochemical analysis showed loss of striatal GABAergic projection neurons. These findings demonstrate that certain prenatal factors, such as neurological maturation, pattern of the insult and cardiovascular instability can influence neuronal outcome following fetal asphyxia. An isolated brief episode of asphyxia can lead to selective hippocampal neuronal loss, while repeated insults induce predominantly striatal damage. These distributions of neuronal loss may be associated with postnatal sequelae such as learning disorders and cerebral palsy.</field><field name="date">1994</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321000 Clinical Sciences::321019 Paediatrics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3174</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Chemoprevention studies with Pacific foodstuffs: effects on xenobiotic metabolising enzymes and cytotoxicity</field><field name="creator">McPherson, Rachel A.

For the chronic study, male Fischer 344 rats were fed defined AIN-76A diet &#177; 10% foodstuff (taro, kumara, pineapple, or coconut), with or without IQ (300ppm for 52 weeks). In the acute study, male Fischer 344 rats were fed defined AIN-76A diet and gavaged with IQ (20 mg.kg-1, 3 days). Pathology was observed and changes in enzyme activities and expression examined. Simple fractionation of the foodstuffs was also performed and their effects on cell viability and enzyme expression were investigated in vitro in freshly isolated rat hepatocytes and immortal human HT29 and P388 cells. In the liver, acute exposure to IQ affected enzymes consistent with complex xenobiotic response element / glucocorticoid response element activation, whereas chronic exposure was consistent with activation of the antioxidant response element. No pattern of enzyme change was obvious in other organs. Inclusion of South Pacific foodstuffs in the diet at 10% had a marked effect on enzyme activity in the liver and lung, although there was no consistent pattern for enzyme changes for a particular enzyme or foodstuff. Enzyme activity in the colon was below the level of detection. There was a complex response when IQ was included with the foodstuffs, which did not resemble the response to either IQ or the foodstuff alone. Fractionation of foodstuffs and in vitro cell-based work did not reveal the presence of compounds in the foodstuffs that explained the complex changes in pathology or XME observed in vivo. The interaction between foodstuffs and IQ in the body was complicated. This may be explained by the presence of many compounds within the foodstuffs that have additive, synergistic, or inhibitory actions on many pathways in the body and underlines the complexity of using whole foodstuffs, rather than a single, purified constituent, in chemoprevention studies.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::320500 Pharmacology and Pharmaceutical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3185</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Perceptions of coercion of patients subject to the New Zealand Mental Health (Compulsory Assessment and Treatment) Act 1992</field><field name="creator">McKenna, Brian G.</field><field name="description">The use of mental health legislation to determine involuntary treatment for people suffering from mental illness (civil commitment) is a controversial issue, centred on the ability of civil commitment to be coercive by limiting patients&#8217; choice, autonomy and self-determination The intent of the New Zealand Mental Health (Compulsory Assessment and Treatment) Act 1992 was to limit coercion by emphasising informed consent (even if treatment can be administered without it); recognising the civil rights of patients subject to civil commitment; and encouraging involuntary treatment in the least restrictive environment (the community). However, there is no evaluative research that considers the extent to which patients subjected to the legislation perceive coercion. The aim of this thesis was to consider the extent to which mental health legal status equates with coercion, the factors that impact on patients&#8217; perceptions of coercion and the factors that have the potential to ameliorate such perceptions. Empirical cross-sectional comparison studies, measuring perceived coercion using a validated psychometric measure, were undertaken at three points during the implementation of civil commitment. These involved a comparison between involuntary and voluntary patients admitted to acute inpatient psychiatric services, a comparison between involuntary patients admitted to acute psychiatric inpatient services and involuntary patients admitted to forensic psychiatric services, and a comparison between involuntary and voluntary outpatients. The studies found that legal status is only a broad index of the amount of coercion perceived by patients. Some voluntary patients feel coerced and some involuntary patients found the process non-coercive. Perceptions of coercion cannot be fully explained by socio-demographic and clinical characteristics, or by coercive incidents that occur throughout the process of civil commitment. Rather, the perceptions relate to the total experience of civil commitment, including the interactive processes with clinicians. In this regard, involving patients in proceedings that are experienced as fair and just (procedural justice) has a marked impact on reducing patients&#8217; perceptions of coercion. In conclusion, the findings are underscored by legal requirements and ethics in order to provide clinical guidelines for implementing civil commitment.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321000 Clinical Sciences::321021 Psychiatry</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3187</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of insulin-like growth factors in the fetus</field><field name="creator">Oliver, Mark Hope</field><field name="description">Fetal substrate supply is important in the regulation of fetal growth. The insulin-like growth factors (IGFs), insulin and placental lactogen (PL) may be important mediators in fetal growth regulation. However, nutritional regulation of circulating concentrations of IGFs, their binding proteins (IGFBPs) and PL during fetal life is poorly understood. The objective of this thesis is to characterise the influence of nutrition on the regulation of these hormones in the fetal circulation. Pregnant ewes were starved for 72 h and then refed for 48 h. After 48 h starvation fetuses were infused with glucose, amino acids or insulin while maternal starvation continued. Other fetuses of fed mothers were infused with recombinant oPL or IGF-I for 24 h. Fetal blood glucose, plasma IGF-I, IGF-II and insulin concentrations all fell on maternal starvation. Fetal plasma IGF-I and insulin concentrations returned to near control values on fetal infusion of glucose or insulin but not amino acids suggesting glucose had a more important role than amino acids in plasma IGF-I regulation and that insulin may have mediated the effect of glucose. Fetal plasma IGF-II concentrations returned to control values on fetal infusion of glucose, but not insulin. Thus fetal plasma IGF-I and IGF-II concentrations appear to be regulated differently by fetal glucose and insulin. Fetal plasma IGFBP-1 and Bp-2 levels increased, while fetal plasma IGFBP-3 and type 2 receptor levels decreased, on maternal starvation. Fetal infusion of glucose or insulin returned fetal plasma IGFBP-1 to near control levels. All fetal plasma IGFBPs were near control levels after maternal refeeding. Fetal plasma IGFBPs and type 2 IGF receptor levels were influenced by nutrition but IGFBP-2, Bp-3 and the circulating type 2 IGF receptor appear to be at least partly regulated by factors other than glucose and insulin. In a separate experiment fetal plasma IGF-I concentrations increased on IGF-I infusion to fetuses whose mothers were on a low plane of nutrition but did not increase in fetuses whose mothers were on a high plane of nutrition suggesting that increases in fetal plasma IGFBP concentrations on maternal starvation or undernutrition may increase fetal plasma IGF-carrying capacity. Plasma concentrations of PL in fetuses whose mothers had been on a high plane of nutrition was higher during starvation than in fetuses whose mothers had been on a low plane of nutrition. Fetal plasma PL concentrations increased 3-fold on maternal infusion of glucose at the end of starvation but was unaffected by fetal infusion of glucose at a lower rate. Fetal plasma PL responses to starvation were influenced by prior nutritional status. The rate of glucose infusion appears to determine the occurrence of a fetal plasma PL response. Fetal blood amino acid nitrogen (AN) concentrations fell on fetal infusion of oPL but fetal blood glucose, plasma IGF-I, IGF-II and insulin concentrations were unaffected. PL does not appear to have a role in the endocrine regulation of the IGFs in fetal sheep but may influence fetal amino acid metabolism. In these studies the fetal plasma concentrations of the IGFs, insulin, PL and plasma levels of IGFBP-1 to -4 have been demonstrated to be regulated by fetal substrate supply. These experiments provide further evidence that these hormones may be mediators in the regulation of fetal growth by fetal substrate supply.</field><field name="date">1994</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3188</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of nuclear lipid signalling in adipocyte differentiation</field><field name="creator">O'Carroll, Simon J. (Simon Joseph)</field><field name="description">The differentiation of preadipocytes into adipocytes is one of the most intensely studied biological processes and has led to the understanding of a number of signaling pathways involved in cell growth and differentiation. The nuclear phosphatidyl inositol (pl) signalling pathway, centred around the enzyme phospholipase C (PLC) &#946;I has been demonstrated to be involved in a number of cellular processes such as mitogenesis and differentiation. Recently components of another lipid signalling pathway, that involving prostaglandins, have also been shown to localise at or within the nucleus. To date, there have been no reports demonstrating the role of either of these nuclear pathways during the differentiation of adipocytes. The 3T3-L1 preadipocyte cell line was used to study the role of nuclear pI and prostaglandin lipid signalling in adipocyte differentiation. In Chapter 3 data is presented to show that two phases of nuclear PLC &#946;l activity occur during adipocyte differentiation. The first phase occurs within minutes of differentiation being induced, is regulated by the actions of extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) l/2 and protein kinase c (pKC) &#945;, and is involved in the mitotic clonal expansion phase of differentiation. The second phase of activity occurs from day 2 of differentiation, is regulated independently of ERK 1/2 and pKC &#945; and is involved in the regulation of the cell cycle factors cyclin D3 and cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk) 4. In Chapter 4 I investigate the nuclear localisation of prostaglandin synthases, how their localisation is altered by differentiation, and the role of these enzymes in adipocyte differentiation is characterized through inhibitor studies. Cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) cyclooxygenase (COX) 1 and 2, microsomal prostaglandin E2 synthase (mPGES), prostacyclin synthase (PGIS), lipocalin prostaglandin D2 synthase (L-PGDS) are localised to the nuclear membrane and their localisation changes during differentiation. The COX 1 and2 enzymes also localise within the nucleus and this COX 1 localisation appears to be cell cycle dependent. COX 2 is functionally coupled to mPGES and PGIS and plays a role in adipocyte differentiation as inhibition of COX 2 with a specific inhibitor (NS 398) completely blocks adipocyte differentiation. COX 1 is functionally coupled with L-PGDS and appears to be involved in lipid metabolism as the inhibition of COX 1 with a specific inhinitor (SC 560) partially blocks lipogenesis. In Chapter 5, I investigate the localisation of prostaglandin receptors in the differentiation process. 3T3- L1 cells express the prostaglandin E2 (EP4) receptor, prostaglandin F2&#945; (FP) receptor and the prostaglandin D2 (DP) receptor but these do not have a nuclear localisation. Activation of the DP receptor is involved in lipid metabolism as the DP receptor antagonist, BW A868C, partially inhibits lipogenesis. lnternalisation of prostaglandins appears to be necessary for differentiation to occur fully as treatment of differentiating 3T3-L1 preadipocytes with the anionic transport inhibitor bromocresol green (BCG) partially inhibits carbaprostacyclin (cPGI2) induced differentiation and completely inhibits that caused by cyclopentenone prostaglandins. Thus, nuclear lipid signalling pathways appear to play a role in the process of adipocyte differentiation and a proper understanding of these pathways may lead to a better understanding of fat cell development and the role it plays in obesity and its related diseases.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3189</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Screening and clinical detection of alcohol disorder in general practice</field><field name="creator">McMenamin, John</field><field name="description">Aim: This thesis reports on the implementation of key alcohol research findings to the screening and clinical detection of alcohol risk and disorder in a general practice. it aims to provide a literature review which will explain the nature of alcohol risk and disorder, why alcohol screening is necessary, and how this screening could be undertaken in general practice using a model of screening by healthcheck. Alcohol risk is presented as the likelihood of an individual to develop alcohol-related complications. Definitions of alcohol disorder are discussed and the reasons for adopting the DSM111R criteria explained. A study is reported in which healthcheck screening is used to improve detection of alcohol risk and disorder in the author&#8217;s general practice. Selected cases are presented to highlight particular issues relevant to alcohol in general practice. The study findings are discussed with reference to the literature review and recommendations on the use of the healthcheck Screening model in general practice presented. Method: All English language medical journals reporting alcohol-related research were identified by contents review (specialist alcohol and New Zealand journals), medline search (using keywords and related articles/author-specific searching) or cross.referencing from other reports. other alcohol-related professional reports were identified from library searches or obtained from original sources. From the literature review, a format was developed for the healthcheck questionnaire which included a brief alcohol screen. This brief questionnaire included three questions on consumption of alcohol, and two questions identifying concern about alcohol use, modified from screening questionnaires available at the start of the study, particularly the Canterbury Alcohotism Screening Test (CAST) and the Self-Administered Alcoholism Screening Test (SAAST). Adult patients registered with the practice were offered a personal invitation by the doctor to attend a healthcheck appointment. Recruitment was undertaken over a 3 year period for 30-69 year olds (754 eligible patients), and a 5 year period for 18-29 year olds (339 eligible patients). Patients attending the healthcheck completed a self-administered questionnaire which was reviewed by the practice nurse, selected examination items performed, and the results were discussed with the patient by the doctor. Alcohol risk was assessed and laboratory tests arranged if appropriate with follow-up appointment offered to those requiring further alcohol assessment. Patients were classified at increased risk by reported consumption, and diagnosed with alcohol disorder by DSM111R criteria (alcohol abuse or dependence). At the completion of each study period, the clinical notes of all patients in the study were reviewed to determine the screening rate and to review all recorded alcohol information including clinical indicators of alcohol disorder, alcohol risk for all screened patients, and the effect of screening on the prevalence of alcohol disorder. Results: Alcohol information was obtained on 851 of 1093 study patients (78%). Screening increased the detection of alcohol disorder from 4% (44 patients) to 8% (84 patients). clinical detection of alcohol disorder was associated with physical, psychological and social factors. Clinical factors most commonly included abnormal liver function tests, gastro-intestinal symptoms, hypertension, gout and mental health symptoms. Personal and relationship problems were also commonly linked to detection in a clinical context. Recruitment for healthchecks was highest among women (78%) with a high level of screening in both 18-29 year old (80%) and 30-69 year old groups(76%). Recruitment of men (70%) was notably more successful in the 30-69 year old group (85%) than in the 18-29 year old group (44%).As a test for DSM111R alcohol use disOrder, the brief alcohol questionnaire included in the healthcheck had a sensitivity of 0.93, a specificity of 0.85, a positive predictive value of 0.25, and a negative predictive value of 0.99. The questions on alcohol consumption were the most sensitive items, identifying increased risk (intermediate or high risk consumption) in 86% of patients with alcohol disorder. The remaining patients were identified by abnormal liver function tests. A positive screening test (consumption male&gt;20, female &gt;15 standard drinks/week) indicated a 1 in 4 likelihood of alcohol disorder, increasing to 1 in 2 if concern was reported on a screening question, or a liver function tests was abnormal. The healthcheck screening programme increased the detected prevalence of alcohol disorder from 4% to 8%. DSM111R criteria identified 32 patients with alcohol dependence and 52 patients with alcohol abuse. lcDl0 criteria identified 16 patients with alcohol dependence and 54 with harmful use. Nearly half of the patients meeting DSM criteria for disorder (48%) were not drinking at high risk levels (consumption male &gt;50, female&gt;35 standard drinks/week). Case examples drawn from the clinical notes indicated that alcohol information may come from multiple sources, and that classification of this information may be difficult, influenced not only by the completeness of the data available but also by medical interventions and other influences on patient alcohol use over time. Classification was also more difficult in some patients due to the complexity of the particular case. There were advantages identified in classifying disorder including enhanced therapeutic options, increased awareness of related issues and completeness of medical problem lists, although interventions in both risk and disorder were possible without formal diagnosis. Conclusion: there is good evidence in the literature supporting the value of general practice screening for alcohol risk and disorder. This type of screening meets accepted criteria. The importance of alcohol as a health problem is supported by both the prevalence of alcohol-related problems in New Zealand, and the relationship between alcohol and morbidity and mortality. lt is possible to recognise a latent or early symptomatic phase (risk or early abuse/dependence) and it proved possible in the study to collect this information on most patients using the healthcheck screen. There is evidence supporting the value of intervention in heavy drinking and it is reasonable to conclude that intervention in a pre-symptomatic or early symptomatic phase is of more value than waiting until more severe disorder is established. There are good screening tests available including consumption measures, patient questionnaires and laboratory tests. These are relatively inexpensive, generally easy to deliver, and provide sufficient information to determine which patients require further assessment of alcohol use. The use of the brief alcohol screening questionnaire as part of the healthcheck screen proved acceptable to patients in the study and was effective at detecting a high proportion of patients with alcohol disorder. The literature suggests that the AUDIT questions have advantages as screening questions given its international acceptability and its use in several general practice-based New Zealand studies. Although the AUDIT was not available at the time the practice study commenced, it could be incorporated in the health check questionnaire. Laboratory screening has an established supportive role, particularly the selected use of liver function tests. The role of other laboratory tests including carbohydrate-deficient transferring remains unclear and general practice research is required to determine if it has a place in screening and in which patient groups. positive screening tests require further assessment. As indicated in the case examples, this assessment may be undertaken gradually as patients attend the surgery. However, there is benefit if the assessment can be completed more fully. An alcohol assessment package for general practice would be useful. The involvement of practice nurses was essential to the successful delivery of healthcheck screening and this role could be further developed. The practice study shows it was possible to implement evidence-based alcohol screening in a general practice. The healthcheck screening model was a successful method of providing screening though recruitment of younger men could be improved. Uptake of healthcheck screening by other New Zealand general practices would require attention to the organisational factors shown to limit screening and preventive health care delivery.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3190</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Myocyte injury and altered vascular function in developing myocardial infarcts</field><field name="creator">Sage, Martin David</field><field name="description">The temporal and spatial relationships between altered vascular function and cardiac muscle cell injury at the margins of developing myocardial infarcts were investigated, because such knowledge might provide potential for intervention in the evolution of myocardial infarcts and limitation of their size. Regional myocardial ischaemia was modelled in isolated rabbit hearts subjected to ligation of the ventral interventricular branch of the left coronary artery (0,30,60,120 or 240 minutes duration), the remainder of the heart being continuously perfused with oxygenated Krebs-Henseleit buffer solution. After the experimental ischaemic period, the whole heart was fixed by perfusion with phosphate-buffered 2.5% glutaraldehyde which, in preliminary studies, was shown not only to preserve the morphological appearance of cardiac muscle cells, but also to stabilise the distribution of flow through the myocardial blood vessels in the pattern pertaining immediately prior to fixation. Polymerising acrylic resin (L.R. White) was then injected into the vessels of the ischaemic and non-ischaemic regions simultaneously at identical pressures. Resin injected into the ischaemic region contained lead dioxide whilst that injected into the other vessels contained Fat Red 7B dye to allow identification of the source of supply of blood vessels within the heart. Cryofracture, freeze-drying and imaging by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with a backscattered electron detector and low vacuum specimen chamber conditions were used. This made possible examination of transmural segments of myocardium spanning the margins of the ischaemic and control ventricular myocardium containing blood vessels filled by resin. SEM showed severe injury of cardiac muscle cells after 60 minutes of ischaemia, as characterised by separation and swelling of some organelles. Earlier ischaemic changes in some cells (focal increase in prominence of t-tubules and sarcoplasmic reticulum) were seen after 30 minutes. There was a transmural progression in development of irreversible injury from the subendocardium to the epicardium between 60 and 120 minutes corresponding to the "wavefront phenonenon". The lateral margins did not show such marked progression and were typically sharply demarcated on a cell-to-cell basis after 60 minutes. An increase in the proportion of functional capillary pathways (from 55% to 85%) in early (30 minutes) ischaemia was succeeded by a profound perfusion defect, corresponding to the "no-reflow" phenomenon, which had a very close temporal and spatial association with severe injury of cardiac muscle cells. Loss of patency was associated with increased proportions of collapsed, compressed capillaries and swollen myocardial cells. This study demonstrated that there is a significant region of myocardium which for a period shows intermediate degrees of myocyte injury (and is thus potentially salvageable) in the subepicardial portion of the developing infarct. Contrary to the claims of various authors similar potentially salvageable lateral "border zones" were neither large nor non-existent. Within 150 microns of the typically abrupt boundary, small discontinuous areas (&lt;20% of this region) showed intermediate degrees of injury, and there was also an increased proportion of non-functional capillaries which were not collapsed or compressed, resulting in a 'low-flow' zone. This narrow lateral zone requires further investigation to determine whether it is static, and thus of negligible size, or whether it moves in advance of infarction and is thus pathogenetically significant.</field><field name="date">1983</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321000 Clinical Sciences::321020 Pathology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3227</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Induction experts: An analysis of beginning teacher support in low-socioeconomic New Zealand primary schools</field><field name="creator">Main, Andrea Squirrel</field><field name="description">This thesis analyses induction programmes in low-socioeconomic New Zealand primary schools. A review of the literature indicates that effective induction is integrated and has four main components: pedagogical development, socioemotional support, professional agency, and structured balance. In addition, New Zealand&#8217;s induction programmes are reported to be strong by international standards. Literature is synthesised to create a framework of low-socioeconomic schools as induction experts. Although there have been large-scale analyses of New Zealand induction programmes, there has been no research on the integrated induction systems found in low-socioeconomic primary schools. A mixed-methods approach was used to investigate the support provided for beginning teachers (BTs) in these schools. Methods included a nationwide survey of BTs in low-socioeconomic primary schools, which was mailed to 467 primary and intermediate BTs (44% response rate). Additionally, from all 156 low-socioeconomic primary schools, five exemplar induction programmes were selected and visited throughout the 2007 school year. Survey analysis, success case methods, discourse analysis, and grounded theory methods indicated that induction in these schools is integrated and strong by international standards. Findings indicate that induction programmes in low-socioeconomic schools are pedagogical, supportive, and well structured; however, not all schools focus on enhancing the professional agency of teachers. Exemplar practices such as peer coaching, university partnerships, on-site BT support groups, curricular leadership roles, and formal programme evaluations were found at case study sites. Analyses of factor themes, cluster graphs, frequency-utility matrices, documents, events, and transcripts of meetings and interviews reveal several key findings. First, the Hauora model&#8212;a M&#228;ori concept of balanced pedagogical, spiritual, socioemotional, and physical development&#8212;may be applicable to induction in the New Zealand setting. Second, analyses indicate that low-socioeconomic schools have relatively strong induction programmes. Third, some teachers&#8212;particularly those beginning after the start of the school year or older teachers in their second year of teaching&#8212;may receive varied support. Findings from this research may provide framing for induction programmes in New Zealand as well as for international longitudinal studies of teacher induction models.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">induction</field><field name="subject">beginning teacher</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">primary</field><field name="subject">support</field><field name="subject">low socioeconomic</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3302</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Analysis of the integrin beta 7 gene promoter</field><field name="creator">Pandey, Sushil K</field><field name="description">The integrin cell adhesion molecules &#945;4&#946;7 (LPAM-1) and &#945;E&#946;7 (HML-1/M290) reside at the surface of white blood cells, and are critical for establishing and retaining the gut immune system that protects us against intestinal infections. &#945;4&#946;7 contributes to lymphocyte homing to the gut by binding to the vascular addressin MAdCAM-1 expressed on high endothelial venules in Peyer's patches, mesenteric lymph nodes and the lamina propria. &#945;E&#946;7 expressed on activated lymphocytes retains lymphocytes at mucosal surfaces by binding to E-cadherin expressed on epithelial cells. Unfortunately &#945;4&#946;7 and &#945;E&#946;7 also contribute to the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, diabetes, and potentially multiple sclerosis by mediating the infiltration and retention of immune cells in inflamed tissues. Understanding the biology of integrins and other cell adhesion molecules will allow us to regulate their expression and function in vivo in order to attenuate inflammation. The mechanisms regulating the expression of integrins are poorly understood, but will be essential to unravel if we are to fully exploit newly devised gene therapy approaches to combat inflammation and cancer. The &#946;7 gene promoter was isolated in our laboratory in order to understand the mechanisms directing the expression of &#946;7 integrins. It has previously been shown that TGF&#946;1 stimulates lymphoid expression of &#946;7 and &#945;E RNA transcripts leading to de novo expression of &#945;E&#946;7 at the cell-surface. In contrast, &#945;4 subunit levels representative of the gut homing integrin &#945;4&#946;7 are decreased. This suggests that TGF&#946;1 produced by intestinal epithelial cells may switch migrating lymphocytes from expressing &#945;4&#946;7 to &#945;E&#946;7, thereby facilitating their retention within the gut intraepithelial compartment. This occurs by a mechanism involving the increased binding of nuclear factors to two TGF&#946;1 response regions (TGFBRR) designated TGFBRR 1 and 2 within the mouse &#946;7 gene promoter that had previously been identified as DNAsc I hypersensitivity regions. Here it has been determined that six potential Spl binding sites residing within the &#946;7 gene promoter interact with either Sp1 or both Sp1 and Sp3. TGFBRR1 contains one Sp1 binding cis-element whereas TGFBRR2 contains two such elements. Gene reporter analysis revealed that Sp1 and Sp3 positively and negatively regulate basal &#946;7 gene promoter activity, respectively. Sp1 synergizes with c-Jun, a member of the AP1 group of transcription factors to facilitate DNA-binding and to superactivate &#946;7 gene promoter activity. Deletion analysis revealed that a reporter construct containing a minimal &#946;7 gene promoter encompassing nucleotides (nt) -78 to +95 is more active than a reporter containing nt -690 to +95. Further analysis revealed the presence of a repressor site within nt -105 to -78. Since no TGF&#946;1 responsive Smad cis-elements could be detected within the promoter, it is believed that TGF&#946;1 controls expression of &#946;7 through multiple Sp1 binding sites. The interaction of Sp1 with c-Jun may facilitate &#946;7 gene expression, whereas Sp3 may antagonize Sp1-driven promoter activity. Presumably, other factors yet to be identified maintain tissue specificity. Whether the inhibitor region plays a role in the later process remains to be determined.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3191</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Exploring the relationship between family involvement and outcome in residential interventions for children</field><field name="creator">Woodfield, Melanie Joslyn</field><field name="description">Family participation in residential interventions for children has been reliably shown to enhance children&#8217;s adaptation to the community following discharge. This finding, however, had predominantly been observed in long-term residential programmes in North America. This thesis examines the influence of family involvement on outcome for children in a short-term residential intervention - the Children&#8217;s Health Camp, in Auckland, New Zealand. This service offers children and families, who may be experiencing social, emotional, physical and/or behavioural challenges, individualised interventions that often include a five-week residential stay. A &#8216;high family involvement&#8217; condition, a community-based programme that followed a residential intervention, was compared with a &#8216;low family involvement&#8217; condition (the traditional residential programme). No statistically significant differences were observed between the groups on parent-report measures of child behaviour and parenting practices, although significant improvements in children&#8217;s behaviour (including emotional, social and conduct aspects) for both groups were found. Reasons for the lack of difference between the groups, and the difficulties inherent in conducting outcome research in a residential facility for children are highlighted. Other influences on outcome for children and families, such as residential staff members&#8217; attitudes toward family involvement were also examined. The optimal conditions for successful short-term residential interventions for children are proposed.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology::380107 Health, clinical and counselling psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3193</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Angels at our tables: New Zealanders' experiences of hearing voices</field><field name="creator">Beavan, Vanessa</field><field name="description">The aim of this study was to explore the experience of hearing voices in the general New Zealand adult population. This included mapping the topography of voices and the impact of the experience on participants&#8217; lives, exploring participants&#8217; explanatory models, investigating coping strategies and support structures, and developing a model of the essence of hearing voices.  Quantitative and qualitative analyses of questionnaire (n=154) and interview (n=50) data revealed a great diversity of experiences, both within and among participants.  Of all topographical variables significantly related to emotional impact (content, form, duration, intrusiveness and control), voice content was the only significant predictor variable, accurately predicting the emotional response of 93.3% of participants. Overall, participants who valued their voice experiences tended to have spiritual beliefs, a more positive emotional reaction and less contact with mental health services.  In contrast, participants who experienced mostly unwanted voices tended to have biological and/or psychological understandings of their voice experiences, a more negative emotional reaction to them, and increased contact with mental health services.  Participants reported using a vast array of coping strategies, with varying degrees of success. Individualised techniques were reported to be the most effective, followed by setting aside a time to listen to the voices. In terms of help and support, participants called for a model of intervention that accepted their voice experiences as real, took an holistic approach incorporating contextual, cultural and spiritual factors, and worked with voice-hearers, their families and the public to provide information about voice phenomena and normalise the experience.  Using a phenomenological approach, a model of the essential structure of hearing voices is proposed, comprising five components: the content of the voices is personally meaningful to the voice-hearer; the voices have a characterised identity; the person has a relationship with their voices; the experience has a significant impact on the voice-hearer&#8217;s life; and the experience has a compelling sense of reality. The implications of this research include validating voice-hearers&#8217; perspectives of the experience, informing clinical work with voice-hearers, and informing the development of local and national-level services, such as a New Zealand Hearing Voices Network.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Auditory hallucinations</field><field name="subject">Voices</field><field name="subject">Psychosis</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3175</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Inhibin-like activity in bull seminal plasma</field><field name="creator">Peek, John Charles</field><field name="description">Testicular function is stimulated from the pituitary gland by the gonadotrophic hormones FSH and LH. The testis in turn regulates gonadotrophin secretion by negative feedback. The agents of feedback are steroids, and in addition, probably a protein hormone, which has been given the name inhibin. A method capable of detecting inhibin-like activity in bull seminal plasma (bSP) was developed. Administration of bSP at the time of castration to five-week old male rats inhibited the post-castration rise of serum concentrations of FSH and LH otherwise seen 24 h later. The degree of inhibition depended on the dose; 0.5 ml bSP or the equivalent amount of bSP-extract always suppressed FSH and LH to levels typical of intact rats. The rats' sensitivity to 0.2 ml bSP varied with the time of year, possibly reflecting seasonal changes in the onset of puberty. The time-course of action of bSP-extract was studied in intact rats. Serum FSH was suppressed 12, 24 and 48 h after a single injection, but not at 3 or 6 h. LH was suppressed at 6, 12, 24 and possibly 48 h.</field><field name="date">1980</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321000 Clinical Sciences::321014 Obstetrics and gynaecology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3177</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigation of the leucocyte activation antigens CG-1, CD100 and HML-1</field><field name="creator">Print, Cristin Gregor</field><field name="description">This thesis describes the investigation of three novel leucocyte activation antigens. The investigation began with the characterisation of the &#945;HML-1 integrin subunit. Immunoprecipitation analysis and Western blotting indicated that &#945;HML-1 associates with the &#946;7 integrin subunit to form a typical integrin heterodimer. &#945;HML-1 appears to be post-translationally cleaved into heavy and light chains which remain linked by disulphide bonds. With the aim of isolating the &#945;HML-1 protein, a 45kDa disulphide-linked polypeptide was isolated from leucocytes by two-dimensional non-reducing / reducing gel electrophoresis, and used to raise a polyclonal antiserum. This polyclonal antiserum detected a protein encoded by a cDNA in a &#955;gt11 leucocyte expression library. This cDNA was designated CG-1. It became apparent that CG-1 did not encode the &#945;HML-1 protein, but rather encoded a novel protein which is abundantly expressed in activated leucocytes and reproductive tissues, and weakly expressed in all other tissues examined. The CG-1 gene may be one member of a larger gene family, as two different chicken relatives of CG-1 have been isolated elsewhere. The deduced CG-1 amino acid sequence contains potential transmembrane domains and a potential nuclear localisation signal motif. On the basis of its primary structure the CG-1 protein is expected to form an &#945; helical coiled-coil dimer. A polyclonal antisera raised against a CG-1 - &#946;-galactosidase fusion protein detected a 300kDa protein on the surface of activated human leucocytes. The apparent molecular weight of this protein is halved following the reduction of disulphide bonds, supporting the contention that CG-1 is a disulphide-linked cell-surface dimer. This protein appears to be associated with tyrosine kinase activity in an in vitro kinase assay. While participating in the Fifth International Conference on Leucocyte Differentiation Antigens we noted that the protein detected by the anti-CG-1 antisera was remarkably similar to a novel leucocyte protein designated CD100. CD100 is a T lymphocyte co-stimulatory antigen capable of signalling in concert with the T lymphocyte antigen receptor to produce T lymphocyte proliferation. Like the protein detected by the anti-CG-1 antisera, CD 100 was associated with tyrosine kinase activity in an in vitro kinase assay, and appeared to be a 300kDa disulphide-linked cell-surface dimer. Anti-CD100 antibodies were able to remove the protein detected by the anti-CG-1 antisera from leucocyte lysates in immunodepletion experiments. This suggests that CG-1 and CD100 are immunologically related, or that CD100 and the protein detected by the anti-CG-1 antisera are physically associated. Current research is directed toward determining the relationship between CG-1 and CD100, and investigating the signalling and costimulatory potential of these molecules. The three leucocyte activation antigens investigated in this thesis all appear to mediate leucocyte transmembrane signalling. All three molecules potentially form the basis of therapeutic approaches for immunoregulation of inflammatory and neoplastic disease.</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3194</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ovine placental lactogen: purification and properties</field><field name="creator">Reddy, Shivanand</field><field name="description">A procedure was developed to purify ovine placental lactogen (oPL) from fetal cotyledonary tissue of late gestation.

CsA is a potent suppressor of T-lymphocyte function and it&#8217;s biological effects have been defined almost exclusively in these terms. However, recent studies in which the agent was shown to exacerbate a T-lymphocyte independent, experimentally induced bacterial infection of the kidney (pyelonephritis), indicated that CsA had effects on host defence mechanisms other than T-lymphocytes. The present study, using animal models, was undertaken to identify the host defence component modified by CsA. Neutrophils are a key component in the early response to infection and the administration of CsA resulted in an increase in the number of these cells in the circulation. When the effect of CsA on the in vitro metabolic activity of neutrophils and their ability to kill microorganisms was investigated, no changes were observed, but the in vivo ability of neutrophils to emigrate from the vasculature to a sterile inflammatory foci was markedly impaired. A model of localised subcutaneous infection was used to determine the effect of this CsA-associated suppression of neutrophil emigration on the ability of the host to mount a response to an infectious challenge. In CsA treated animals, neutrophil accumulation in E. coli infected, subcutaneously implanted sponges was initially suppressed, allowing bacterial numbers to increase rapidly. By 48 hours this powerful bacterial stimulus overrode the suppressive effects of CsA and led to a substantial increase in the size of the neutrophilic infiltrate. This finding of an initially reduced inflammatory response, followed by an increase in the influx of inflammatory cells, provided a possible explanation for the earlier observation that CsA promoted infection and tissue damage in experimental pyelonephritis. The relationship between the effect of CsA on neutrophil emigration and the pathogenesis of experimental pyelonephritis was therefore investigated. When CsA was administered to animals prior to inducing pyelonephritis, the neutrophilic infiltrate was markedly suppressed in the early stages. As predicted, this led to a logarithmic increase in bacterial numbers, the infiltration of large numbers of neutrophils and, ultimately, an exacerbation of tissue damage. Further studies, examining the effects of CsA on neutrophil-mediated inflammatory mechanisms, identified impaired neutrophil-to-endothelial cell adhesion as the most likely explanation for the observed defect in host defences. The integrated nature of cellular defence mechanisms in infectious disease is highlighted by these investigations. when microorganisms invade tissue, even though the number and function of circulating leucocytes may be normal their effective participation in the host response to infection depends on the ability to emigrate from the blood vessels to the site of infection. In summary, the discovery of additional properties of CsA provide an explanation for the patterns of infectious disease in patients treated with CsA, in whom infection with extracellular pathogens is common. It also seems likely that the ability of CsA to suppress neutrophil emigration may contribute to the effectiveness of the agent in the management of inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, uveitis and psoriasis.</field><field name="date">1990</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3195</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cognitive factors in the maintenance of chronic fatigue syndrome</field><field name="creator">Moss-Morris, Rona Elizabeth</field><field name="description">Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) is an illness characterized by persistent debilitating fatigue of uncertain origin. Precipitating and perpetuating factors of this illness are thought to be distinct and the aim of this thesis was to gain greater insight into the role of cognitive factors which may maintain the condition. This work was guided by two central frameworks, the self-regulatory model of illness representations and the cognitive taxonomy of psychopathology. These were used to define the different cognitive constructs and to investigate the way they function as a system to maintain pathological schema and disability in CFS. Three studies using different methodologies were conducted to test the hypotheses. The first employed a descriptive comparative design to ascertain whether CFS patients have unique cognitions which contribute to their disability over time. The sample was comprised of CFS patients without depression (n=39), CFS patients with a concurrent diagnosis of depression (n=14), patients with a primary diagnosis of depression (n=20); and healthy controls (n=38). The groups were matched in aggregate for age, gender, race, and education. Subjects completed the Cognitive Errors Questionnaire-Revised, which measures cognitive distortions relevant to both general and somatic events, and the Illness Perception Questionnaire, which measures the five dimensions of the illness representation in conjunction with other standard measures. Between-group analyses confirmed that the depressed group was distinguished by a low self-esteem, feelings of guilt and self-recriminations, the propensity to make cognitive distortions across all situations, and to attribute their illness to internal, stable and global factors. In contrast, the CFS patients were characterized by low ratings of their current health status, a strong illness identity, external attributions for their illness, and distortion in thinking that were specific to somatic experiences. CFS depressed patients had lower self-esteem than non-depressed patients and had the most pessimistic illness beliefs. A six month follow-up showed that CFS patients' cognitive structures and level of disability remained remarkably stable. Illness identity, serious consequences, somatic errors, and limiting coping accounted for a substantial proportion of the variance in CFS patients&#8217; disability scores over time. These results are discussed in terms of their support for both of the cognitive models. CFS patients appeared to have distinct cognitions which were associated with ongoing disability. The subsequent two quasi-experimental studies were conducted in a single laboratory session. The first of these used standardized neuropsychological tests to determine whether psychological variables, particularly somatic focus, interfere with CFS patients&#8217; performance on high load attention tasks. The discrepancy between CFS patients&#8217; subjective reports of concentration and memory difficulties and objective evidence of these deficits was also investigated. The subjects included 25 CFS patients matched for age, gender, and intelligence with two groups of healthy controls. One of these groups underwent a somatic induction procedure as part of the investigation of the effects of somatic preoccupation on attention tasks. The tests included the verbal memory subscales from the Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised and the Paced Auditory Serial Addition Task (PASAT), a measure of divided attention and speed of information processing. The analyses of the induction data failed to support the validity of this procedure resulting in the somatic control group being dropped from the analysis. Consistent with previous studies the principal deficit in the CFS group appeared to be on the PASAT. The CFS group appeared to be less accurate than healthy controls in their appraisal of their performance, which were related to negative mood rather than objective performance. Depression was also related to high performance expectations in the CFS group, but not the controls. The results did not support the original assumption that somatic preoccupation contributes to neuropsychological difficulties in CFS. However, mood factors were clearly shown to impact on both the objective and subjective experience of symptoms. The aim of the final study was to investigate the concordance between the self-report data collected in study one and information processing biases in CFS. Comparisons of the CFS patients and healthy controls on a modified Stroop attention task and a self-schema memory task, found no evidence of an illness-related bias in CFS patients&#8217; processing of information. Rather, they demonstrated a significant tendency to be distracted by and remember depressed-relevant stimuli. The exception was their propensity to make somatic interpretations. These results are discussed in terms of the defensiveness hypothesis, which proposes that CFS patients&#8217; negative, external illness perceptions and somatic distortions may act as a defence against underlying feelings of low self-esteem. The complex nature of CFS patients&#8217; cognitive structures was revealed and the need to use measures which do not rely on self-reports was clearly demonstrated. These studies provided further support for the central role of cognitive factors and mood in perpetuating CFS.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321000 Clinical Sciences::321021 Psychiatry</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3225</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of the inducible transcription factors in status epilepticus-induced delayed neuronal death</field><field name="creator">Preston, Kerin Maree (nee)</field><field name="description">Status epilepticus (SE) is a serious neurological disorder, characterised by prolonged and/or frequent seizure activity. Following SE, a selective and delayed neuronal death (DND) occurs in limbic regions of the brain, particularly in the hippocampus. The objective of this thesis was to investigate the molecular basis of SE-induced DND in the Wistar rat hippocampus. Following the induction of SE, moribund (i.e. dead/dying) neurons were identified by histological staining, DNA fragmentation and an increase in activated microglia. Clusterin, a glycoprotein implicated in apoptotic cell death was also observed to accumulate in the soma and axons of moribund neurons 72-144 hr following SE. Morphological evidence suggested that dying neurons exhibited many of the classical features of apoptosis (i.e. apoptotic body formation, oligo-nucleosomal DNA fragmentation and rapid phagocytosis of debris) and therefore raised the possibility that SE-induced DND might be programmed (i.e. requiring de novo protein synthesis). To investigate this hypothesis I have examined the temporal and anatomical expression of a number of proteins which may have a critical role in SE-induced DND. The expression of the inducible transcription factors (ITFs) was examined as they couple extracellular stimulation to the transcription of late effector gene(s), resulting in long-term phenotypical changes in the neuron and therefore, they may couple SE-inducing stimulation with DND. A high correlation was shown between neurons which exhibited a delayed and prolonged ITFP expression and those which were selectively vulnerable to SE-induced DND (e.g. CA1 and CA3 pyramidal cells and dentate hilar neurons). However, administration of the protein synthesis inhibitor anisomycin following the induction of SE reduced the ITFPs expression, but resulted in an increase in SE-induced DND after 48 hr. However, the levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)-like immunoreactivity were also shown to attenuate at this time after this procedure. Thus, protein synthesis inhibitors administered following SE may attenuate the level of trophic support and promote cell death. To further investigate the role of the ITFPs in nerve cell death, etoposide, a DNA topoisomerase II inhibitor, which is known to facilitate apoptosis was infused into the hippocampus. The results suggested that a complex ITFP expression occurred which preceded nerve cell death. Moreover, this nerve cell death occurred earlier (12-24 hr) and was not anatomically selective. Furthermore, following the etoposide infusion, clusterin was expressed in the hippocampal pyramidal cells, in the dentate hilar neurons and in the dentate granule cells, however the latter exhibited the strongest BDNF-like immunoreactivity. In summary, circumstantial evidence suggests that the ITFPs may form a critical component in the cascade of events which couple toxic stimulation to nerve cell death. However, this thesis demonstrates that the ITFPs have a complex role in DND, as although the ITFPs may be sufficient to induce DND, they may not always be necessary (e.g. in the absence of sufficient trophic support).</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3197</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies of the mechanisms of resistance of non-cycling cells to amsacrine and related antitumour drugs</field><field name="creator">Robbie, Maxine Ann</field><field name="description">Several studies have shown that non-cycling cells are resistant to the cytotoxic effects induced by amsacrine (m-AMSA; 4'-(9-acridinylamino)methanesulphon-m-anisidide). This resistance may limit the activity of m-AMSA and related 9-anilinoacridine antitumour agents against solid tumours. The biochemical mechanism(s) for this resistance have been investigated using spontaneously transformed Chinese hamster fibroblast (AA8 cells) in log- and plateau-phase spinner cultures. In early plateau phase most cells entered a growth-arrested state with a G1-G0 DNA content and showed a marked decrease in sensitivity to cytotoxicity after a 1-h exposure to m-AMSA or its solid tumour-active analogue, CI-921. Studies with radiolabelled m-AMSA demonstrated that changes in sensitivity to m-AMSA-induced cell killing were not due to a difference in uptake or retention of drug by log- and plateau-phase cells, and there was no significant metabolism of drug by either log- or plateau-phase cells. Thus, after a 1-h exposure to [3H]-m-AMSA at 37&#176;C, a small proportion (1%) of cell-associated radioactivity was covalently bound to macromolecules, but most of the cell-associated radioactivity represented unchanged m-AMSA. There was no evidence for any oxidative metabolism to reactive quinoidal species in these tumour cells. However, studies with a fluorescence assay for DNA unwinding indicated that plateau-phase cells were 3 to 4 times less sensitive to m-AMSA-induced DNA breakage than log-phase cells, and changes in sensitivity to m-AMSA-induced DNA breakage correlated with changes in sensitivity to cell killing by m-AMSA as cell progressed from log to plateau phase. Further studies showed that the decrease in sensitivity to m-AMSA-induced DNA stand breakage correlated with a decrease in sensitivity to covalent DNA-protein complex formation in plateau-phase cells after m-AMSA treatment. Combined with evidence that the DNA lesions rapidly disappeared from both log- and plateau-phase cells following the removal of m-AMSA (half-time approx. 4 min), this indicated that the lesions detected by the FADU assay probably arose from the stimulation of DNA-topoisomerase II (topo II) cleavable complex formation by m-AMSA. K+/SDS precipitation assays with [32p] 3&#8217;-end-labelled pBR322 DNA indicated that nuclear extracts containing topo II activity from plateau-phase cells were 3- to 4-fold less sensitive to stimulation of DNA-topo II complex formation by m-AMSA than nuclear extracts from log-phase cells. This change in sensitivity to m-AMSA-induced DNA-topo II complex formation was therefore similar to that observed with intact cells. However, P4 unknotting assays indicated that topo II activity in nuclear extracts from plateau-phase cells was only 2-fold lower than that in nuclear extracts from log-phase cells. Resistance to treatment with m-AMSA may therefore reflect a decrease in topo II activity and/or a decrease in sensitivity of topo II enzymes to stimulation of cleavable complex formation by m-AMSA in non-cycling cells.</field><field name="date">1988</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321000 Clinical Sciences::321020 Pathology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3198</field></doc><doc><field name="title">TATA binding protein in Alzheimer's Disease</field><field name="creator">Reid, Suzanne J</field><field name="description">Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a late onset neurodegenerative disorder, affecting tens of thousands of people in New Zealand, as well as their families and caregivers. AD is characterised by extra cellular &#946;-amyloid (&#946;A) deposition, Tau-containing neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) and progressive cortical atrophy. Abnormal protein accumulation is also a common feature of other late onset neurodegenerative diseases, including the heritable polyglutamine (polyQ) disorders such as Huntington disease (HD) and the spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs). One of this family of disorders, SCA17, is caused by an expansion of a polymorphic polyQ repeat in TATA binding protein (TBP), an essential transcription factor. Surprisingly, the wild type TBP repeat length ranges from 25-42, and in Caucasian populations the most common allele is 38, a size large enough to cause HD if within the huntingtin protein. Wild type length TBP accumulates in the disease structures of HD and in at least some of the SCAs. The work described in this thesis investigates the hypothesis that the TATA binding protein (TBP) contributes to AD. This thesis describes the discovery that TBP accumulates in AD brain, localising to NFTs. Also, a proportion of the detectable TBP present is insoluble; a signature of the polyQ diseases. TBP positive structures are shown to be present differentially between patients and its amount and distribution is not directly proportional to that of Tau or &#946;-amyloid positive structures. To investigate if the polyQ repeat length in TBP is associated with AD, alleles were genotyped from two large case/control cohorts. In one cohort, but not the other, older patients carried longer TBP polyQ repeats than controls, and the effect was enhanced when subjects homozygous for the ApoE4 allele were removed from the dataset. Evidence is presented that transcriptional activation by HMGBI, a chromatin associated protein that binds to the polyQ tract within TBP, is altered when co-expressed with TBP carrying 90 glutamines. Taken together this data provides evidence for the hypothesis that the accumulation or misfolding of this polyQ containing protein may be a contributing factor in Alzheimer's disease.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::320500 Pharmacology and Pharmaceutical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3199</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Regulation of the beta7 integrin gene in T cells: role of the MAPK signalling pathways</field><field name="creator">Shafiei, Farhad, 1974-</field><field name="description">Members of the integrin superfamily of adhesion molecules are involved in cell to cell, cell to ECM, and cell to pathogen interactions, and are of fundamental importance in many biological processes. The &#946;7 integrins &#945;4&#946;7 and &#945;E&#946;7 have evolved to play specialized roles in gut mucosal immunity. &#945;4&#946;7 mediates the homing of lymphocytes to intestinal Peyer's patches, mesenteric lymph nodes, and the lamina propria by binding to the vascular addressin MAdCAM-1 (Fong et al., 1997). &#945;E&#946;7 binds epithelial E-cadherin retaining lymphocytes at the intraepithelial compartment of the mucosa. The expression of &#945;E&#946;7 is induced on migratory lymphocytes by TGF-&#946; secreted by gut enterocytes. The signalling mechanisms responsible for basal and TGF-&#946;-induced expression of &#946;7 integrins are not well understood. Previous studies identified two TGF-&#946;1 response regions in the &#946;7 gene promoter termed TGFBRR-1 and TGFBRR-2 encompassing nucleotides -509 to -398 and -121 to -34. Here, TGF-&#946;1 activation of the &#946;7 gene proximal promoter is shown to be mediated by MAPK family members. TGF-&#946;1 stimulation of TK-1 T cells increased the steady-state mRNA levels of the &#946;7 gene relative to &#945;4 transcripts, and led to enhanced phosphorylation of c-Jun. TGF-&#946;1 stimulation induced rapid increases in the binding of nuclear protein complexes to TGFBRR-1 and -2. Sp1 and Sp3 which mediate TGF-&#946;1 signalling were shown to bind to an Sp1 cis-element encompassing nucleotide positions -67 to -60 within TGFBRR-2. The interaction of Sp1 with its cognate binding site was c-Jun dependent. In contrast, there was no evidence for involvement of the Smad proteins. ATF-2 was identified to bind to a region encompassing nucleotide positions -699 to -689 just upstream of TGFBRR-1. Sp1 and ATF-2 expression vectors co-transfected into Sp1-deficient SL-2 cells synergized to drive the activity of a &#946;7 gene luciferase reporter. Mutation of the ATF-2-binding site modestly reduced &#946;7 gene reporter activity. The involvement of c-Jun in TGF-&#946; signalling and interaction of Sp1 with the &#946;7 gene promoter suggested that MAP kinase pathways might mediate &#946;7 gene transcription. Specific chemical inhibitors were used to ascertain which of the three MAPK pathways namely p38, JNK, and ERK were involved. Results obtained by nuclear run-on transcription analysis which measures nascent RNA synthesis showed that both the p38 and JNK pathways regulate &#946;7 gene expression in TK-1 cells, whereas only the p38 pathway regulates &#945;4 gene expression. Thus, treatment of TK-1 cells with the p38 inhibitor SB203580 and the JNK inhibitor SP600125 inhibited the synthesis of &#946;7 transcripts, whereas only SB203580 inhibited the synthesis of &#945;4 transcripts. Conversely, sodium arsenite which induces JNK and p38 upregulated nascent synthesis of &#945;4 and &#946;7 RNA transcripts. SB203580 blocked the binding of nuclear factors to TGFBRR-1, and ATF-2 binding to nucleotide position -699 to -689. Similarly, SP600125 blocked the binding of Sp1 and Sp3 to TGFBRR-2, whereas unexpectedly SB203580 enhanced their binding. Furthermore, both SB203580 and SP600125 decreased cell-surface expression of the &#946;7 subunit and SB203580 inhibited TK-1 cell adhesion to MAdCAM-1. In contrast, the MEK inhibitor PD98059 had no effect on the expression of nascent &#946;7 RNA transcripts and cell-surface expression of the &#946;7 subunit, suggesting that the ERK pathway is not involved in regulation of &#946;7 gene expression in TK-1 cells. In contrast to the results obtained with TK-1 cells, SB203580, SP600125, and PD98059 each inhibited the nascent synthesis of &#945;4, &#946;7, and &#945;E transcripts in peripheral blood lymphocytes. In conclusion, this study has revealed for the first time that both the p38 and JNK pathways mediate TGF-&#946;1-induced expression of the integrin &#946;7 gene. Expression of the &#946;7 gene is Sp1-dependent, and involves the synergistic cooperation of c-Jun and ATF-2. It is proposed that the p38 and JNK pathways play a role by triggering the activation and translocation of c-Jun and ATF-2 to the nucleus.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321000 Clinical Sciences::321020 Pathology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3216</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Role of the crystalline lens in ametropia</field><field name="creator">Scott, Rolene</field><field name="description">When examining the dimensions of the crystalline lens, it is found that some may vary with different types of refractive error. The effects of several of these variations on refractive error are investigated in this thesis. To examine whether lens thickness was significantly different in youth-onset myopes compared with emmetropes, a structural model was developed and tested. No substantial difference was found between the two groups. In both groups of eyes, increased lens thickness was found to contribute significantly to the refractive state of the eye; a thicker lens effectively being a stronger lens. The crystalline lens may play a different role in early adult-onset myopia which develops after normal growth has ceased compared to its role in youth-onset myopia. Cross-sectional data from early adult-onset myopes, youth-onset myopes and emmetropes were evaluated to determine whether lens thickness differed among the refractive error groups. No significant differences were found. However, some early adult-onset myopes and youth-onset myopes were re-evaluated three years after the initial data were collected and a significant increase in mean lens thickness was, found in the group of early adult-onset, myopes. No significant mean lens thickness increase occurred in the group of youth-onset myopes. To evaluate further the contribution of the crystalline lens dimensions to the refractive state of the eye, radii of curvature and. lens thicknesses of a group of anisometropes were examined. Radii were found not to be consistently flatter or steeper in the relatively, more myropic eye compared with the relatively less myopic eye and there was also no significant difference between mean lens thickness of the relatively more myopic eye compared to mean lens thickness of the relatively less, myopic eye. Crystalline lens thickness and radii of curvature were therefore found to play only a minor role in refractive error development, Deeper vitreous chambers and steeper corneal curvatures were found to be the major contributors to myopia.</field><field name="date">1993</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::320900 Optometry</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3220</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Breath hydrogen studies of lactose malabsorption in children resident in New Zealand, Cook Islands and Western Samoa</field><field name="creator">Seakins, John Medgley</field><field name="description">Lactose malabsorption (LM) in children was diagnosed by an elevated breath hydrogen (BH) level following a 10g lactose load. A portable gas chromatograph and a semiconductor detector, designed and constructed for use in the Pacific Islands is described. Following verification on known malabsorber and. normal subjects, the technique was used to determine the prevalence of LM in Europeans at Auckland and Rarotonga, and in Samoans at two locations in Auckland and two locations in Western Samoa. The prevalence of LM in Europeans was significantly (p&lt;0.01) higher at Rarotonga than at Auckland. For Samoans, the prevalence of LM was significantly (p&lt;0.01) higher in Western Samoa than at Auckland. The prevalence of LM was very highly significantly (p&lt;0.001) related to race. Each child tested for LM filled in a questionaire to determine attitude, consumption of and perceived intolerance to milk, milk biscuits and ice cream. Lactose malabsorption was significantly (p&lt;0.05) correlated to milk consumption and to attitude to dairy products, but not to sex, age, and perceived intolerance. The consumption of dairy products was very highly significantly (p&lt;0.0001) correlated to attitude, and highly significantly (p&lt;0.001) correlated to location and perceived intolerance. There was no significant correlation between consumption and race, sex or age. Perceived intolerance to individual dairy products was significantly correlated to attitude to milk (p&lt;0.0001), milk biscuits (p&lt;0.02) and ice cream (p&lt;0.001). Perceived intolerance was not related to age, sex, race, location or the actual symptoms following the consumption of 10g lactose. The unexpected finding of increased LM in the Pacific Islands, was investigated further by studying the LM status of the Medical Team during a visit to western Samoa, and by performing a microbiological survey of water quality. It was found that half of the Medical Team 3/6, became malabsorbers during the week spent in Western Samoa. On returning to New Zealand it was shown that lactase levels took 3 months to normalise. The water supply in Western Samoa was shown to contain very high levels of coliform bacteria. The currently held hypothesis that genetic factors are solely involved in the onset of LM, was not supported. The evidence from the survey supported environmental factors are also involved in adult onset LM. The hypothesis suggesting that dietary lactose was a requirement for retaining elevated lactase levels, was tested using Galactosemic and Phenyl Ketonuria patients. None of the patients had developed LM although they had been on a low lactose diet for years, hence the theory was not supported. The BH method proved highly successful in diagnosing LM with many of the children actually enjoying it.</field><field name="date">1983</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321000 Clinical Sciences::321019 Paediatrics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3201</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies on the GH/IGF axis in the infant rat brain following hypoxic ischemic injury</field><field name="creator">Scheepens, Arjan</field><field name="description">Brain injuries, be they hypoxic, ischemic, traumatic or neurodegenerative result in permanent neurological deficit and presently there are few or no therapeutic interventions available. Recent research into how and why brain cells die after an insult has elucidated that a significant number of cells die in an apoptotic manner. Following a transient brain injury cells continue to die for upto 5 days after the insult thereby giving a window of opportunity for treatment. In response to injury, the brain produces a range of neurotrophic hormones including insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-I), which are thought to act as endogenous neuroprotective agents. This response occurs earlier and to a greater extent in the young. Studies have shown that the exogenous administration of these neurotrophic hormones after brain injury can prevent some cell death, likely through an inhibition of apoptosis. In these studies a well characterised model of HI brain injury in the juvenile rat was used to investigate the response of the IGF-I and growth hormone (GH) axes to brain injury. The action and transport of IGF-I is partly regulated by six binding proteins (IGFBP1-6) for which the response of IGFBP 1-5 to neural injury has been shown. The starting point therefore is a description of the response of IGFBP-6 to HI brain injury. Although the GH receptor is widely expressed in the brain on both neurones and glia, no reports have definitively shown the existence of its ligand, GH within the brain. Here I show that the GH receptor is differentially regulated after neural injury and that its immunolocalisation suggests an importation mechanisms for peripheral GH into the injured CNS, via the choroid plexus. Furthermore I show that a GH-like substance is strongly upregulated after injury, specifically associated with stressed and dying neurones and glia. Subsequently, I show that intracerebral infusions of rat GH into the injured rat brain conveys significant protection exclusively to GH receptor bearing neurones. In summary, these data show a GH-like substance may be acting as a new neurotrophic factor which is upregulated after brain injury and may act as an endogenous neuroprotective agent.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3200</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Hypoxic-ischemic injury in the developing brain: pathogenesis and neuroprotection</field><field name="creator">Sizonenko, St&#233;phane Vladimir</field><field name="description">In newborn infants, birth asphyxia represents the predominant cause of brain injury. These infants will later exhibit neurodevelopmental disabilities or a more major cerebral palsy. Prevention of adverse outcomes requires an understanding of the way in which these deficits develop. Endogenous protective mechanisms arising from the insult have opened new insights in neuroprotective strategies. Neurotrophic factors such as IGF-1 and its N-terminal tripeptide GPE have been shown to confer some neuroprotection after HI injury in the adult rodent. In the P21 rat brain after moderate HI injury, exogenous intracerebral and intraperitoneal injections of GPE (30&#956;g and 300&#956;g respectively) were neuroprotective in the hippocampus and lateral cortex possibly through binding to glia as detected by autoradiography of 3H-GPE. In the preterm infant the mechanisms of white matter injury remain to be clearly elucidated. To mimic the pattern of diffuse cerebral injury of the very preterm infant, a transient moderate focal HI injury has been applied on the immature P3 rat. This new model showed a significant reduction in the lateral cortical volume with reduction and alteration of the myelination pattern in the cortical white matter (WM) at P21. These cortical alterations result from neuro-axonal damage 24h after the insult as shown with Fluoro-Jade B staining and &#946;-APP accumulation. In addition activated astrocytes from 24h after HI up to P21 were present. This model should enable us to elucidate some of the pathogenic mechanisms involved in diffuse WM injury. Brain damage in the developing brain has two components: 1) the pattern and mechanisms of injury are correlated with the stage of development at the time of injury; 2) it will influence subsequent brain development.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321000 Clinical Sciences::321019 Paediatrics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3212</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Neurochemical and functional characterization of the ischaemic/reperfused retina</field><field name="creator">Sun, Daniel</field><field name="description">Ischaemic cell death has been implicated in a number of retinal diseases, including glaucomatous neuropathy, proliferative diabetic retinopathy and a range of vascular diseases. The cascade of events leading to cell death involves both cellular metabolic changes and a functional component. However, it is yet unknown how long these changes persist, whether all cell classes are affected, and the characteristics of recovery. Moreover, there have been few studies correlating the neurochemical changes with the ensuing functional changes. The aim of this thesis was to track the metabolic and functional recovery of the ischaemic rat retina, given the premise that: (1) amino acid neurochemistry reflects metabolic integrity and cellular identity, and; (2) the permeation of a cation channel probe called agmatine reflects channel functionality. Quantitative pattern recognition analysis of overlapping amino acid and agmatine expression profiles were used to provide a statistically robust classification of cells according to metabolic and functional characteristics. This classification was spatially complete and with single cell resolution. Finally, the electroretinogram was used to also assess retinal function and corroborate the observed neurochemical changes. These measures were taken at intervals for up to two weeks of reperfusion. The results show that by 48 hours of reperfusion, amino acid metabolism had returned to near normal levels, although cell classes were missing, and there was persistant cation channel gating anomalies. Immunocytochemical labeling identified a preferential loss of cone bipolar cells, with all remaining rod bipolar cells showing increased cation channel gating. The electroretinogram and agmatine experiments showed that this dysfunction is likely due to abnormal glutamate release from pre-synaptic photoreceptors, detected by changes in post-synaptic agmatine permeation, and not due to the presence of anomalous metabotropic glutamate receptors. Cholinergic amacrine cells demonstrated persistant neurochemical labeling, but did not show cationic flux following stimulation by glutamate agonists. In conclusion, the retina shows remarkable recovery in the amino acid metabolism, although functional changes persist. Finally, structural integrity or immunocytochemical labeling does not necessarily imply that cells maintain functional receptors, or that neurotransmitter release is normal secondary to disease.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321000 Clinical Sciences::321016 Opthalmology and vision science</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3213</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Purification, biochemical and somatogenic characterisation of ovine placental lactogen</field><field name="creator">Singh, Kuljeet</field><field name="description">Ovine placental lactogen (oPL) is secreted by the placenta into both the fetal and maternal compartments. Its biological function(s) during pregnancy and the mechanisms involved are still unclear. A purification procedure was developed for oPL from sheep placental cotyledons of late gestation. Four procedures were attempted to obtain homogeneous oPL. Recoveries of oPL and total protein were measured throughout the several procedures using a specific oPL RIA and the Bradford protein estimation respectively. The third and fourth procedures resulted in homogeneous oPL and a partial amino acid sequence was obtained from the fourth procedure. In the successful procedures, the placental tissue was extracted with 0.1 M ammonium bicarbonate pH 8.5. A pH precipitation of the soluble fraction was performed, followed by 60% saturation with ammonium sulphate. Further separation steps involved chromatogaphic procedures. Carboxymethylcellulose (CM32) cation exchange was performed batchwise at pH 5.6. Subsequently chromatofocusing was performed to elute proteins in order of their isoelectric points. This was carried out using a pH gadient of 0.9 to 6.0. The final chromatographic step was reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) using a C4 column. To obtain homogeneous oPL in the third procedure, the partially purified oPL was subjected to SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and the separated proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. The homogeneous oPL was eluted from the membrane, however, sequencing was unsuccessful. It was assumed that the N terminal of oPL was blocked. Homogeneous oPL was obtained in the fourth procedure by electrophoretic elution from the Hunkapiller gel system performed at 4&#176;C. The oPL was digested with trypsin, the fragments were separated by RP-HPLC chromatography and two peptides were sequenced. Peptide 1: F D E Q Y G Q G I Peptide 2: Y I N C H T Several strategies were attempted to provide more homogeneous oPL to enable more sequencing. The partially purified oPL fractions from each of these attempts were pooled and electrophoresed on an SDS polyacrylamide gel. The section of acrylamide containing the oPL band was homogenised and a trypsin digest was performed. The digested oPL was separated from the gel pieces, filtered through a Sep-Pak filter and the fragments were separated by RP-HPLC. The yield of oPL was low, but sufficient homogeneous oPL was obtained to provide a partial amino acid sequence from tryptic peptides. A further two peptides provided sequences. Peptide 3: (L) A G E M V N R F D E Q Y G Q G I Peptide 4: (L) Q P G K C Q I P L Q S L F Collaborators from Genentech Inc (San Francisco USA) used partially purified oPL produced from the present study and also obtained homogeneous oPL (Colosi et al., 1989). Complementary DNA clones of oPL were isolated and expressed in mammalian cells by recombinant DNA techniques (Colosi et al., 1989). These clones were sequenced, demonstrating that the full sequence of oPL consists of 198 amino acids preceded by a 38 amino acid sequence signal. Recombinant oPL was generated by Colosi et al. (1989) which provided sufficient material to perform physiological studies in vivo. The somatogenic effects of recombinant oPL were investigated in the growth hormone (GH) deficient dwarf rat and compared to identical doses of recombinant bovine GH (bGH) in 3 independent studies. Both oPL and bGH treatments resulted in an increase (p&lt;0.05) in body weight gain compared to that in saline treated controls, with oPL treatment being more potent than bGH (p&lt;0.05). In promoting linear growth, oPL was more potent (p&lt;0.05) than bGH in some instances. Nitrogen content of dry carcass matter was increased with oPL treatment compared to saline (p&lt;0.05), with a nonsignificant increase in bGH treated animals. Carcass fat was similarly reduced by both oPL and bGH treatment (p&lt;0.05) compared to saline. Serum insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) concentrations were increased significantly (p&lt;0.05) by both oPL and bGH treatments, with a significantly greater effect of oPL suggested in one study. No increase in hepatic IGF-I mRNA was evident with either treatment, suggesting that the increase in serum IGF-I is due to posttranscriptional mechanisms. The expression of IGF binding protein 3 (IGFBP-3) hepatic mRNA was increased (p&lt;0.05) with bGH treatment compared to that after saline treatment, but was unaffected by opL treatment, indicating regulation by GH at the transcriptional level. The binding of [125I]bGH to hepatic membrane preparations demonstrated no difference in specific binding compared to that in saline controls. However, [125I]oPL specific binding was greater in oPL treated animals (p&lt;0.05). Animals treated with bGH had reduced (p&lt;0.05) hepatic GH receptor mRNA compared to saline controls, but oPL treatment had no effect. Thus, oPL is a potent anabolic and lipolytic agent in the dwarf rat, exerting greater somatogenic effects on some parameters than bGH. The studies in this thesis have described biochemical and biological characterisitics of oPL. The amino acid sequence of oPL is more closely related to prolactin (PRL) than to GH (Colosi et al., 1989). However, oPL has potent somatogenic activities in the GH deficient dwarf rat. Our data suggest differences in receptor binding and effects on GH receptor and IGFBP-3 expression with these two treatments, raising the possibility of actions through different pathways or differential effects at the GH receptor level. These results do not fully resolve whether GH and PRL exert all effects through a single receptor or whether there is a separate PL receptor.</field><field name="date">1992</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321000 Clinical Sciences::321019 Paediatrics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3247</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The order of premodifiers in English nominal phrases</field><field name="creator">Feist, James Murray</field><field name="description">The research reported in this thesis sought an explanation for the order of premodifiers in English nominal phrases. It aimed to establish what validity there is in the quite divergent earlier explanations, to find any other valid forms of explanation that might exist, and to integrate them all. The method was to make a wide survey of as many varieties of current English as possible, by observation; to then analyse the order at all levels (semantics, syntax, and so on); and to check the accuracy of the results against the 100-million-word British National Corpus. From that research, the thesis asserts that parts of most past approaches can be integrated into a comprehensive explanation; and that there is a new and important element of the full explanation, namely that of words' semantic structure, which is the combination of types and dimensions of meaning that make up the sense of each premodifier. Other new elements in this treatment of the subject are analysis of long groups of premodifiers (up to 10 words), consideration of why premodifiers regularly occur in different positions in the order, and explanation from the historical development of premodifier order. After an introductory chapter and a survey of the relevant literature, the thesis argues that the explanation of premodifier order in English nominal phrases is as follows. There are four positions for premodifiers, as in "your (1) actual (2) tinny (3) round (4) percussion instrument" [i.e. a tambourine] (chapter 3). The regular, unmarked order (illustrated in the phrase just quoted) has several elements of explanation: primarily, the semantic structure (chapter 4); secondarily, the syntactic structure (chapter 5). In a second type of order (when two or more words occur in one position), stylistic considerations control the order, not grammatical ones (chapter 7). In a third type of order, a marked one, a premodifier may be put in a position different from the position that the word's usual semantic structure would require, changing its meaning and stylistic effect (chapter 8). Some features of all three types of order are to be explained partly by their historical development - for example, the existence of borderline uses (chapter 9). There are some supporting explanations, from discourse structure and psycholinguistics, for example (chapter 10). The relevance of the previous chapters to wider issues, such as grammaticalisation, is discussed (chapter 11); and conclusions are drawn (chapter 12).</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380200 Linguistics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3301</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Role of interleukin 2 and interleukin 3 in haemopoiesis</field><field name="creator">Le Gros, Graham Stephen</field><field name="description">The hormones interleukin 2 (ILZ) and interleukin 3 (IL3 can stimulate the growth of immature haemopoietic cells. These hormones are synthesised by mature thymus-derived (T) Iymphocytes. The observation that the haemopoietic tissue of the bone marrow contain few T lymphocytes leads to the question of what role IL2 and IL3 have in haemopoiesis. An original finding described in this thesis was that IL3 induced a population of haemopoietic cells to synthesise IL2, IL3, IL4 and GM-CSF when stimulated with complexes of antigen and antibody. This demonstrated that there were cells in the bone marrow which synthesised hormones normally considered T lymphocyte-derived. It was possible to correlate the production of IL2, IL3, IL4 and GM-CSF by IL3-dependent cells with Ag.Ab complex- and mast cell-associated inflammatory processes. A second finding described in this thesis was that haemopoietic cell lines dependent on IL3 for growth could be stimulated to grow by IL2. A unique feature of these IL3-dependent cell lines was that they could be adapted to an IL2-dependent growth state without further differentiation occurring. Such cells provide a tool for dissecting the intracellular growth regulating pathways which are controlled by IL2 and IL3. The influence of IL2 on the development of T lymphocytes in the microenvironment of the thymus was examined. It was found that the normal programme of T lymphocyte differentiation was altered by IL2. IL2 was found to stimulate the growth of an immature class of thymocytes which expressed cytotoxic activity. These cells had the potential to participate in host immune and inflammatory responses. The haemopoietic cell responses induced by IL2 and IL3 appear to reflect the differentiation of immature cells for roles in immune responses. This indicates that IL2 and IL3 may not have a role in normal haemopoietic cell development. The hormones which normally regulate the output of cells from the thymus and bone marrow may not yet be fully defined.</field><field name="date">1987</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::320200 Immunology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3221</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Relationships between neurotoxicity, accumulation, and physiochemical properties of a series of platinum drugs</field><field name="creator">Screnci, Daniela</field><field name="description">Peripheral neurotoxicity induced by some platinum chemotherapy agents is the dose limiting factor, seriously affecting the quality of life of chemotherapy patients who receive this treatment. The cause of the peripheral neurotoxicity remains unknown. Using an animal model, the neurotoxic profiles of a series of platinum compounds and their related stereoisomers were determined. The series consisted of cisplatin, carboplatin, oxaliplatin, S,S-oxaliplatin, ormaplatin, R,R- and S,S- ormaplatin and JM216. The neurotoxicity of these compounds in the animal model was correlated with their hydrophobicity, accumulation and reactivity. Also, using peripheral nerve tissues dissected at the end of treatment (or at specific timepoints) from the animals, morphological changes induced by the platinum compounds were also measured. Animals were administered the platinum compounds at the maximally tolerated dose, for a period of eight weeks, to determine the onset of neurotoxicity as indicated by changes in the sensory nerve conduction velocity (SNCV). The cumulative doses at which the platinum compounds in the series induced neurotoxicity (neurotoxic dose potency) in the animal model varied. Oxaliplatin induced neurotoxicity at the smallest dose and therefore at the earliest timepoint (l5&#181;mo1/kg, 3 weeks of treatment) and carboplatin induced neurotoxicity at the highest dose and the latest timepoint (322 &#181;mo1/kg, 8 weeks of treatment). The neurotoxic dose potency was compared to data obtained from the literature of incidence of neurotoxicity in patients. There was a strong correlation (r2 = 0.9871). It has previously been hypothesised (Gregg. et al. 1992) that platinum accumulation in peripheral nervous tissues plays a role in platinum induced neurotoxicity. Using tissues obtained from animal studies, the platinum concentration in peripheral nerve tissues was determined via Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometry. There was no correlation between the amount of platinum accumulated in these tissues (dorsal root ganglia, sural nerve and sciatic nerve) and neurotoxicity. Furthermore it was expected that the accumulation of these compounds in the peripheral nervous system would be related to the hydrophobicity of the compound. The inverse was found to be true. The more hydrophilic the platinum compound, the greater the accumulation in the peripheral nerve tissues, and the more hydrophobic the platinum compound the lesser the accumulation in the peripheral nerve tissue (eg. drg r2 = 0.99, P=0.004). Using in vitro protein binding half life, the reactivity of compounds in the platinum series was assessed. It was determined that the neurotoxic compounds had a shorter half life and were more reactive than the non neurotoxic compounds. A positive correlation was also observed between reactivity and the incidence of neurotoxicity in patients (r2 = 0.89, P=0.0005). Tissues obtained from the animals were used to measure changes in dorsal root ganglia nucleolar diameter, and comparison made between the nucleolar diameter of each of the treatment groups, and their changes in SNCV. Strong correlations were observed between nucleolar diameter changes and altered SNCV in animals (r2=0.9971). From the above-mentioned studies, insight was gained into the physical parameters of the platinum compounds in the series that were associated with different neurotoxicity profiles. As yet a definite mechanism has not clearly defined but it is hypothesised to involve molecular nucleolar changes.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3217</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Some aspects of human placental enzymology</field><field name="creator">Small, C.W.</field><field name="description">A.

Insulin bound specifically to both normal and transformed cells with similar dependence on temperature, time, and pH. There were fewer high affinity and more low .affinity receptors on tumour cells compared with normal adult fibroblasts. The affinity of insulin receptors in normal foetal fibroblasts was less than in normal adult fibroblasts while transformed foetal fibroblasts had receptors of even lower affinity. The sensitivity of insulin receptors to down regulation by insulin was measured in the human breast tumour cell lines MCF-7 and T-47D and the human colon tumour cell line HCT-8 and was compared with measurements in normal human adult fibroblasts. Adult fibroblasts were sensitive to down regulation (40% loss of binding after 2h exposure to 17nM insulin) whereas breast tumour cells were resistant to down regulation (15-17% loss of binding after 4h exposure to 170nM insulin). HCT-8 cells were sensitive to down regulation after 4h exposure to 3.8nM insulin but the extent of down regulation lessened at higher concentrations of insulin. This paradoxical result appeared due to an increase in the affinity of receptors on HCT-8 cells for insulin following exposure to hormone; by comparison, the affinity of receptors on fibroblasts significantly decreased during down regulation. Insulin-induced down regulation of receptors was also compared between normal and transformed foetal fibroblasts. Normal foetal fibroblasts were less sensitive to insulin-induced receptor down regulation than were adult fibroblasts. Transformed foetal fibroblasts had lost all high affinity receptors so that receptor down regulation was too low to measure. Biological responses to insulin (insulin-stimulated [3H]leucine incorporation into protein and [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA) were measured in parallel with studies of receptor regulation in order to assess the effect of down regulation on cell metabolism. Fibroblasts were more responsive to insulin-stimulated leucine and thymidine incorporation than were tumour cells. Down regulation of insulin receptors decreased the responsiveness of fibroblasts but not tumour cells to insulin-stimulated leucine incorporation. Responsiveness of tumour cells to insulin-stimulated leucine incorporation paradoxically increased with lengthy exposure to insulin. The responsiveness of fibroblasts to insulin-stimulated thymidine incorporation was unchanged following receptor down regulation and insulin did not induce a change in cell number. Insulin had variable effects on thymidine incorporation in tumour cells and in most instances induced parallel changes in cell growth. Tumour cells thus differ from normal cells in their expression and regulation of insulin receptors and their responsiveness to insulin. These differences may well contribute to the metabolic and growth advantage that tumour cells have over normal tissue.</field><field name="date">1986</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3231</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Systems approach to a comprehensive community project: a study in community psychology</field><field name="creator">Seymour, Frederick William</field><field name="description">This thesis uses the concepts and methods of community psychology, and. applies them to what is called here a &#8220;comprehensive community project&#8221;. This is a project that undertakes to meet the needs of a community by fostering and strengthening the community&#8217;s own resources. The objectives of the research were : (1) to establish a comprehensive community project in the Auckland. suburbs of Birkdale and Beachhaven, and (2) to propose and. test a model for project organization and evaluation. The model was derived. from the systems approach to programme evaluation which provides a reasoned and. logical approach to all aspects of programme management. The model proposed involved systematic steps from initial programme planning to outcome measurement. The steps are, specifying the "system&#8221; or particular project, forming the values from which interventions would be derived, assessing needs and. resources, setting annual goals for activities from the foregoing steps, allocating available resources to activities, implementing and. reviewing activities, measuring outcome after one year, and feedback of this information for project improvement. Application of the model to the &#8220;Birkdale Project&#8221; showed that the model was relevant to management needs, and. Information yielded by application of the model was used. in day-to-day decision making. Thus the model was instrumental in establishing the Birkdale Project, and. in producing the vigorous project that resulted. in the first year a wide range of activities involving a significant portion of the population were provided. to meet community needs, and almost all the Project&#8217;s annual goals were attained. Although the project was established largely by paid professionally trained people, at the end. of the research period. the project was managed and run by non-professional residents. It was concluded. that the systems approach is highly appropriate to the development of comprehensive community projects, and has general advantages to the wider field of community psychology as a method for practice and research.</field><field name="date">1978</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321000 Clinical Sciences::321021 Psychiatry</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3232</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Study of the pathogenesis and immunobiology of pyelonephritis</field><field name="creator">Miller, Thomas</field><field name="description">The experiments carried out during this investigation have studied the pathogenesis and immunobiology of pyelonephritis. Two experimental models of the disease were developed in laboratory animals and several new analytical procedures for studying biological changes during the course of the disease were established. In particular, methods for the determination of glomerular filtration rates in small animals, the automated analysis of antibacterial antibody and the in-vitro determination of the response of rat lymphocytes to phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) were established. The effect of chronic active pyelonephritis on renal function was studied and the effect of antibiotic treatment and elimination of infection on the pathological changes in pyelonephritis was determined. Eradication of infection did not affect the gross pathology and histopathological changes found at autopsy. These experiments have also investigated the role of bacterial interference as a determinant in the epidemiology of renal infection. It was shown that mixed renal infections with E.coli were uncommon and that the pattern of infection was determined by the resident pathogen. The relationship between bacterial infection or the renal parenchyma with E.coli and the establishment of pathological lesions was investigated and the conclusion reached that infection of the kidney is not always associated with pathological changes. The term "acquiescent infection" was then used to describe the host parasite relationship in which active persistent bacterial infection is not associated with pathological lesions. Antigen presentation as a factor in the protective immune response to renal infection was also studied and experiments carried out which demonstrated that immunological memory to the Somatic antigen of E.coli persisted for at least Six months after primary immunization and appeared to be carried by the B lymphocytes. The distribution of B lymphocytes in the peripheral blood and lymphoid sites and the functional capacity of T cells during the course of pyelonephritis were also investigated. Lymphocytes forming the lymphocytic infiltrate in the kidney were identified an thymus derived lymphocytes by their surface labelling characteristics but further experiments showed that T lymphocytes in the kidney, which would normally respond to stimulation with PHA in-vitro, were non-responsive and presumably non-functional. A unique factor associated with renal cells was found to be capable of blocking the PHA response of T lymphocytes, suggesting that ablation of cell-mediated immune mechanisms in the kidney may contribute to the persistence of infection in pyelonephritis. This concept was investigated by studying the effect of a selective deficiency of thymus derived lymphocytes on the course of pyelonephritis. The experiments showed, however, that ablation of T lymphocytes did not appreciably alter the course of the disease. Further experiments were then carried out investigating the role of B lymphocytes in the immune response by manipulation of the hosts immune capacity using immunosuppressive drugs. Animals with pyelonephritis did not produce antibacterial antibody but were able to eliminate organisms more readily from the infected kidney than untreated animals with a normal immune response. This suggests that blocking of the phenomenon of immunologic enhancement may explain these unexpected results and that the immune response to renal infection could have an enhancing role, protecting the bacterial cell from otherwise effective host defense mechanisms. Clinical aspects of antimicrobial resistance in pyelonephritis were also investigated in a study of urinary tract pathogens from 120 patients. The results showed that standard methods for testing antibiotic sensitivity may reject potentially useful antibiotics and that up to 75% of microorganisms considered resistant to individual antibiotics may in fact be sensitive to concentrations of antibiotic attainable in the tubular lumen. In certain circumstances the determination of minimum inhibitory concentration of selected antibiotics may be of considerable value in patient management.</field><field name="date">1975</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3240</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A scanning electron microscopic and electrophysiological investigation of experimental acoustic trauma</field><field name="creator">Thorne, Peter Rowland, 1954-</field><field name="description">Investigations were undertaken to describe and quantitate the topographical abnormalities which develop in the organ of Corti as a result of acoustic trauma, and to determine their relationship to the associated losses of cochlear function assessed by the compound action Potential (N1) and cochlear microphonics (CM). Thirty guinea pigs were exposed, while anaesthetised, to a tone of 3 KHz at 125 dB SPL for 30 minutes. Both organs of Corti were examined by scanning electron microscopy either immediately or 1,3,7 or 14 days after exposure. In the second study 26 anaesthetised guinea pigs were exposed to 5 KHz at 125 dB SPL for 30 minutes. Cochlear potentials were recorded from the round window of the right cochlea and N1 audiograms (sound Pressure level required to elicit N1 Plotted against frequency) and 10 &#956;v isopotential curves (sound pressure level required to produce 10 &#956;v CM plotted against frequency) were produced for each animal either within one hour or 1,7,14 or 28 days later. The same organ of Corti was examined by scanning electron microscopy. Cochlear potentials were compared to mean values from 16 normal guinea pigs. Most animals developed topographical changes in one or both organs of Corti after exposure to 3 KHz (90%) and in the right organ of Corti after 5 KHz (92%). There was a wide variation in both the length (3 KHz: 0.1-4.15 mm; 5 KHz: 0.5-16.0 mm) of lesions and the number of hair cells affected. Both these indices of damage increased significantly (p &lt;0.01) in the 24 hours following exposure to 5 KHz. Early damage to hair cells included either collapse, fusion or loss of stereocilia and there was an increase in the proportion of affected cells towards the centre of the lesions where supporting cells were damaged also. Subsequent to exposure, collapsed stereocilia appeared to become fused and some hair cells, particularly OHC, with stereocilia abnormalities were lost. However, others, particularly IHC, remained for up to 28 days despite abnormal stereocilia. Early changes occurred around the position of maximum displacement of the basilar membrane and subsequent extension of the lesions occurred equally in both apical and basal directions. Fusion was the only stereocilia change to develop after exposure. Regions of the organ of Corti showing supporting cell damage were replaced within 3-7 days by the proliferation of inner sulcus and Claudius&#8217; cells. The substantial initial loss of both N1 thresholds and CM sensitivity partially recovered during the first 24 hours after exposure, but paradoxically, this was associated with the significant increase in the topographical changes in the organ of Corti. N1 threshold loss occurred over all frequencies and was maximum 1/2 &#8211; 1 octave higher than the exposure frequency (5 KHz). All lesions occurred within regions corresponding to changes in N1 thresholds. In the first 24 hours topographical changes occurred over a much smaller area of the organ of Corti than indicated by changes in N1 thresholds. Seven or more days later the longer lesions (30%) reflected the extent of changes in N1 but the remainder were smaller than indicated by this functional loss. This suggests that functionally important damage to the cochlea is more extensive than indicated by hair cell loss, stereocilia abnormality or supporting cell changes in the organ of Corti. Therefore, investigations of the effects of noise should not be based simply on topographical changes in the organ of Corti as these often underestimate the extent of injury to the cochlea.</field><field name="date">1982</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321000 Clinical Sciences::321020 Pathology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3251</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Epidemiology of birthweight and placental weight in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Thompson, John Michael David</field><field name="description">The introduction to this thesis is a literature review. Kramer, in a study commissioned by WHO, reviewed the literature prior to 1985 on low birthweight. This is extended, mainly in respect to infants who are small for gestational age with emphasis on important findings in relation to birthweight since that time. Work in New Zealand on birthweight is also summarised. The literature is also reviewed in respect to the mechanisms in the pathway between the placenta and the fetus, and in respect to recent work suggesting a link between birthweight and disease in adult life. This thesis examines factors that influence birthweight and placental weight. Birthweight for gestational age percentile curves for the New Zealand population were firstly defined. small for gestational age (SGA) infants could then be categorised. The thesis considers two sources of data, the first a cross-sectional sample of the New Zealand population from 1987 to 1990 (the control subjects of the New Zealand cot Death study, a national case-control study on sudden infant death syndrome), and the second a hospital population in Auckland (National Womens Hospital (l992)). These two datasets are investigated to determine factors that influence birthweight in a univariate situation and then in the multivariate situation. Independent variables are considered using a priori categorisations and where appropriate Quantile-Quantile (Q-Q) derived categorisations determined by producing plots of the quantiles of cases versus controls. A number of variables under the headings of socio-demographic, lifestyle, genetic, obstetric and nutrition are examined and found to be associated with the outcomes of interest at the univariate level. After controlling in multivariate analyses a number of variables are found to be no longer significant, however some show strong relationships. The variable relating to smoking in both datasets shows the greatest detrimental effect on the outcomes considered in respect to birthweight. This confirms that in New Zealand, as in other places in the world, smoking has significant consequences on birthweight. The data is also investigated for the timing of insult to the fetus from smoking, and is found to be most important during pregnancy. comparison of the results comparing those obtained using a binary outcome for SGA, and those obtained using birthweight continuously, show relatively consistent results. The odds ratios and the decreases in birthweight obtained from both datasets show a relatively linear relationship between the two. An examination into whether a distinct group of individuals exists in respect to having large placentae for birthweight, indentified an artefact in the dataset relating to recording of placental weight for twins. After removal of twins from the dataset, examination of factors that influence placental weight showed that the factors that influence placental weight are not the same as those that influence birthweight. In particular smoking is found not to influence placental weight, and haemoglobin, which has no influence on birthweight, is found to be inversely associated with placental weight. other factors such as parity are found to influence placental weight in the same proportion in which birthweight is affected. In conclusion this thesis shows that factors investigated in New Zealand are consistent with findings in the international literature in relation to birthweight. The results on factors that influence placental weight add to the international literature on a topic on which little work has been carried out. The results of this thesis point to areas where future research needs to be carried out, in particular in relation to maternal nutrition during pregnancy and maternal energy expenditure during pregnancy. There is also a need for further research into the relationships of factors on placental weight and the ratio of birthweight to placental weight, and how these relationships affect health outcomes in childhood and adult life.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321000 Clinical Sciences::321019 Paediatrics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3250</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Role of the foetal adrenal glands in the mechanism of initiation of parturition in the ewe</field><field name="creator">Liggins, Graham Collingwood</field><field name="description">Pregnancy in the sheep, as in other mammals, has a genetically-determined species-specific duration.

The work of this thesis is an attempt to elucidate some of the factors responsible for ensuring that at the appropriate time the uterus of the pregnant sheep expels its contents. From a review of existing publications it is obvious that the factors influencing gestation length in sheep are poorly understood and that the mechanism of initiation of parturition is unknown. It is fruitless to try to apply knowledge gained in other species to the solution of the problem; among the multitude of hypotheses, none has proved acceptable as a complete description of the events which culminate in parturition in a particular species let alone as a basis secure enough to permit extrapolation to sheep.</field><field name="date">1969</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3252</field></doc><doc><field name="title">New Zealand's London: The metropolis and New Zealand's culture, 1890-1940</field><field name="creator">Barnes, Felicity</field><field name="description">The role of London in forming New Zealand&#8217;s culture and identity is a significant feature of New Zealand&#8217;s cultural history that has, until now, been overlooked.  Ties with London and with &#8216;Home&#8217; generally, have received little study, and &#8216;Britishness&#8217; in New Zealand is largely considered a legacy of demography to be eventually outgrown.  This thesis suggests something different.  During the period 1890-1940, technology changed cultural perceptions of time and space, and it changed the relationship between metropole and former colony too.  These technologies drew New Zealand and London closer together.  London was constructed as an active part of the New Zealand cultural landscape, rather than as a nostalgic remnant of a predominantly British-born settler population.  London was New Zealand&#8217;s metropolis too, with consequences for the way New Zealand culture was shaped.  This thesis considers the cultural impact of London using four tropes linked to those changing perceptions of time and space.  &#8216;Greater New Zealand&#8217; is concerned with space, whilst &#8216;&#8220;New&#8221; New Zealand&#8217; is concerned with time.  &#8216;London&#8217;s Farm&#8217; and the &#8216;Imaginative Hinterland&#8217; consider propinquity and simultaneity respectively.  Each theme draws from different bases of evidence in order to suggest London&#8217;s broad impact.  Collectively, they argue for a shift away from a core and periphery relationship, towards one better described as a city and hinterland relationship.  This approach draws upon existing national, imperial, and cultural historiography, whilst at the same time questioning some of their conventions and conceptions.  New Zealand as hinterland challenges the conceptual borders of &#8216;national history&#8217;, exploring the transnational nature of cultural formations that otherwise have been considered as autochthonous New Zealand (or for that matter, British) developments.  At the same time, whilst hinterlands may exist as part of empire, they are not necessarily products of it.  Nor are they necessarily formed in opposition to the metropole, even though alterity is often used to explain colonial relationships.  &#8216;New Zealand&#8217;s London&#8217; is, instead a reciprocal creation.  Its shared cultural landscape is specific, but at the same time, it offers an alternative means for understanding other white settler colonies.  Like New Zealand, their cultural histories may be more complex cultural constructions than national or imperial stories allow.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">history</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">culture</field><field name="subject">empire</field><field name="subject">London</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::430000 History and Archaeology::430100 Historical Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3344</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Effect of Substrate Parameters on the Morphology of Thermally Sprayed PEEK Splats</field><field name="creator">Withy, Benjamin Paul</field><field name="description">Thermal spray is a well established technology that is commonly used in the aerospace and automotive industries.  This thesis reports on the effect that substrate surface chemistry, morphology and temperature has on the morphology of PEEK single splats on aluminium substrates.  PEEK single splats were deposited by HVAF and plasma spraying on aluminium substrates with 6 different pretreatments.  Substrates were either sprayed at room temperature, or 323&#176;C, and a subset of substrates was held at incremental temperatures up to 363&#176;C.  HVAF deposited splats on room temperature substrates showed sensitivity to surface chemistry, with increased circularity and area associated with low levels of hydroxide and chemisorbed water on the aluminium surface.  Substrates held at 323&#176;C were more sensitive to substrate morphology, where rough surfaces resulted in decreased circularity and area apparently independent of surface chemistry.  Substrate temperature trials revealed a significant step in the results, equating to greater circularity, and lower splat area, perimeter and Feret diameter.  This step occurred between 123&#176;C and 163&#176;C, the two points bracketing the glass transition temperature of PEEK (143&#176;C).  This result  was due to the relaxation of splats deposited on surfaces above 143&#176;C, whilst splats on cooler substrates quench through the glass transition and do not relax.  PEEK splats deposited by plasma spray on room temperature and 323&#176;C substrates showed sensitivity to the amount of hydroxide and chemisorbed water present on the aluminium substrates, with low levels resulting in more circular and larger area splats.  Plasma splats did not show the same temperature effects as HVAF splats, thought to be due to the more molten state of plasma splats upon impact compared to the HVAF splats.  The primary conclusions reached were that plasma sprayed polymers were sensitive to surface chemistry, and that as such the surface chemistry of a substrate should be considered when forming plasma spray polymer coatings.  It was also concluded that the kinetic energy of particles in HVAF thermal spray contributed significantly to the thermal energy of a particle on impact, allowing for improved splat properties without overheating the particles in flight.  Finally it was concluded that substrate temperature is far more important for HVAF thermal spray of polymers than plasma spray of polymers, but that it improves splat properties for both techniques.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Thermal Spray</field><field name="subject">Surface Chemistry</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::291400 Materials Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3382</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Assessment of ductile endurance of earthquake resisting steel members</field><field name="creator">Hyland, Clark</field><field name="description">This thesis provides a structural and materials engineering explanation for many of the running fractures that occurred in steel structures during the destructive Kobe and Northridge earthquakes in the mid 1990s.  A method is developed that allows the ductile endurance of structural steel members subjected to cyclic plastic deformation during earthquakes to be assessed and for pre-necking running fractures to be avoided.  The study commenced following the 2000 World Earthquake Conference in Auckland.  The conference brought together the findings of the huge research effort, in America, Japan, Europe and New Zealand, that followed the Kobe and Northridge earthquakes.  The running fractures that had occurred in steel structures represented an unpredicted failure mode that structural engineers have not known how to predict or suppress through the engineering design process.  A clear fundamental understanding of the causes and how to prevent the fractures did not arise from the conference. In fact apparently conflicting results were reported.  Full scale cyclic tests in New Zealand on structural assemblies had not resulted in running fractures, whereas tests in American and Japan had.  Structural engineers designing earthquake resistant structures rely on constructional steel to be materially homogeneous and nominally tri-linear in behaviour.  Steel is expected to behave elastically under regular in-service loading, have a reliable and flat yield stress-strain characteristic, and under overload then develop predictable levels of strain-hardening in conjunction with significant plastic elongation up to its ultimate tensile strength.  Steel is expected to eventually fracture after further plastic elongation and necking.  Ductile design strategies and methods utilise the plastic elongation characteristics of steel to protect structures in earthquake.  Plastic deformation is considered to beneficially dissipate energy generated in the structure by a severe earthquake and also dampen the structure&#8217;s response.  The occurrence of running fracture without significant cyclic plastic deformation and before section necking in steelwork, therefore undermines the basis of the ductile seismic design approach. The initial part of the thesis is devoted to bringing together the fundamental aspects of materials engineering related to fracture of constructional steel.  This is intended to provide a bridge of knowledge for structural engineering practitioners and researchers not fully conversant with materials engineering aspects of fracture.  Fracture behaviour in steel is a broad and complex topic that developed rapidly in the twentieth century driven by the demands of technological growth.  The unexpected fracture of welded liberty ships at sea in World War 2; the need for reliable long term containment for the nuclear reactors in the 1950s and 1960s; and prevention of fatigue failures in aircraft frames since the 1950s all drove engineering research into steel fracture behaviour.  There are many subtle variations in definitions in the published literature on fracture that can be confusing.  Therefore an attempt has been made to clarify terminology.  The term brittle fracture in particular is only used in this thesis as applying to running fracture when the general or far field tensile stresses are below the yield stress of the steel.  The term pre-necking or running fracture is preferred to describe the condition more broadly which may occur prior to and also after general yielding, but before section necking.  Running fracture is a manifestation of pre-necking fracture in which insufficient plastic flow is available in the assembly to absorb the energy released upon fracture. The experimental studies investigated the behaviour of constructional steel commonly used in New Zealand, at various levels of plastic strain.  This started with Charpy V-Notch (CVN) testing which revealed that a significant transition temperature shift and curve shape change occurs with increasing plastic strain and the associated strain-hardening.   This showed that the ability of steel to avoid pre-necking or running fracture reduces as the level of plastic strain-hardening increases. Temperature controlled Crack Tip Opening Displacement (CTOD) testing was then undertaken. The setting of testing temperatures for the CTOD tests were guided by review of the CVN test results, using published CVN to fracture toughness correlation methods.  However running cleavage fractures developed in the CTOD specimens at higher than predicted temperatures of 10 oC and 20 oC.  These are typical service temperatures for structures in New Zealand and so are very likely to occur at the time of an earthquake. The implication from this is that there are levels of strain-hardening and conditions of material notching constraint that can lead to pre-necking and running fracture in New Zealand fabricated steel structures, under severe earthquake loading. Care was taken in the CTOD testing to monitor and maximise the capture of data electronically using a specially developed Direct Current Potential Drop method.  This allowed the test results to be analysed and considered in varying ways, leading to a consistent assessment of the CTOD, crack growth, and the specific work of fracture in each test piece.  While CTOD test results have sometimes been published by structural and welding engineering researchers in the wake of Kobe and Northridge, the results were typically of little use for this study as the CTOD initiation point was generally not identified effectively.  The effect of remote plastic flow in the specimens was also not adequately accounted for.  The CTOD test results were often simply used to help correlate other factors observed by the researchers.  Side-grooving of specimens was not reported as having been used in any of the published results reviewed.  When conducting CTOD test with highly ductile constructional steels it is very difficult to get useful CTOD results if the specimens are not side-grooved, as significant necking and tunnelling will otherwise occur and limit the usefulness of the results. Work by Knott and also by McRobie and Smith was seminal in terms of identifying some critical aspects of plane strain development in CTOD tests, and the links to non-metallic particle density with respect to fracture toughness and CTOD at initiation. Some of their findings with regards to the effect of pre-strain on CTOD initiation were subsequently found to confirm the experimental findings in this study. No effective methodology for prediction of pre-necking or running fracture in a structural member or assembly when subjected to gross plastic cyclic deformation was found to exist in the literature.  It was concluded however that the principles of specific work of fracture, and monotonic and cyclic fracture similitude were particularly relevant.  These were therefore utilised in the development of the design method proposed in this thesis.  The CTOD test results were reviewed, isolating the remote plastic flow component, to determine the critical specific work of fracture property Rc of the steels tested. A meeting with Professor Kuwamura at the University of Tokyo was providential, allowing discussion of his similitude principle, and observations in person of some of the fractured specimens developed during his full scale test series&#8217;.  Running fractures with cleavage were evident in the specimens, with their tell-tale chevron markings. He had predicted running fracture problems in structures in Japan ahead of the Kobe earthquake and been largely ignored.  His insights were subsequently seriously considered in Japan after the earthquake. He and his colleagues developed the principle of structural similitude that relates monotonic fracture displacement ductility to cyclic fracture displacement ductility for a particular assembly.  This arose from their observation that running fractures developed from ductile crack formation at blunt notches in structures.  The similitude principle has echoes of the Coffin-Manson approach to ductile crack initiated low cycle fracture.  The principle of similitude has a log&#8211;log relationship as does the Manson-Coffin relationship.  So where notch plasticity controls the initiation of fracture in a structural assembly it is conceptually reasonable to expect that the number of cycles to initiation of fracture from a notch will have a log&#8211;log relationship to the amplitude of the cyclic strain developed in the notch. Kuwamura found that steel assemblies with lower CVN energy had reduced cyclic fracture endurance than the same assemblies made with steel with higher CVN impact energy.  However no method of predicting performance of any particular assembly could be developed from his observations.  The benefit of his method primarily relates to the minimising of testing necessary to assess the fracture limited cyclic displacement ductility of a structural assembly.  However it doesn&#8217;t provide a means for designing a structural assembly to achieve specific levels of ductile endurance other than clearly identifying the need to use steel with good CVN characteristics. The most significant development arising from this thesis is therefore the development of a design method to assess cyclic ductile endurance.  The method utilises the specific work of fracture properties obtained from CTOD specimens of the steel in conjunction with a relatively simple fracture mechanics assessment and an elasto-plastic finite element analysis (FEA).  The FEA model is used to determine the displacement ductility of the assembly at the calculated onset of pre-necking fracture.  The elasto-plastic stress&#8211;strain properties of the steel in various pre-strain states required for the FEA may be derived from tensile testing.  Kuwamura&#8217;s similitude principle is then used to predict cyclic plastic endurance at various constant displacement ductility amplitudes.  The method is extended using Miner&#8217;s rule to allow for the effects of increasing variable amplitude cyclic plastic loading. In summary the thesis explains why pre-necking and running fractures occur in steel members subjected to cyclic plastic deformation during a severe earthquake.  In addition a method for consistently assessing the ability of structural steel assemblies to achieve a specified level of ductile endurance during earthquakes is proposed.  The method is verified against published results for a cyclic test of a simple steel member with a crack at mid-span.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">fracture mechanics</field><field name="subject">structures</field><field name="subject">constructional steel</field><field name="subject">seismic</field><field name="subject">specific work of fracture</field><field name="subject">CTOD</field><field name="subject">charpy v-notch</field><field name="subject">finite element analysis</field><field name="subject">similitude</field><field name="subject">manson-coffin</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3381</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigating the role of Customers and other external influencers in radical new product development &#8211; a network approach</field><field name="creator">Joseph, Richard</field><field name="description">The broad objective of this thesis is to extend our understanding of radical new product development (NPD) beyond degree of customer orientation (CO) by assessing the role and influence of both customers and other external influencers (OEIs). While a number of studies have investigated the relationship between CO and NPD outcomes, such studies typically focus on incremental NPD. The role of customers is also typically investigated using numerical scales to understand degree of CO, and fails to consider the important implementation issues of which, when and how customers are involved through the NPD process. In addition to customers, other external influencers (OEIs) such as investors, suppliers, distributors, competitors, universities and advisors are also increasingly involved in radical NPD, but the roles and actual influence of these different groups is unclear. To address these gaps in the literature this thesis adopts a network approach to investigate the role of customers and OEIs in the development of six radical new products. Six retrospective case studies are conducted, all involving the development of radical ICT products targeted at industrial markets. To provide further insight, three of these cases involve successful new products while the remaining three involve unsuccessful products. Analysis of case data involves qualitative and quantitative network analysis as well as thematic analysis of interview transcripts. Clear differences are found between the ways in which the successful and unsuccessful cases involve customers and OEIs. For example, firms developing successful products focus on existing customers with whom they have strong previous relationships, while developers of unsuccessful products do not. Furthermore, the successful cases all involve customers actively as co-developers of the product, while none of the unsuccessful cases take this approach. These findings are presented in detail and discussed in relation to the existing literature. A set of empirically-based propositions are outlined as a foundation for future research.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">radical new product development (NPD)</field><field name="subject">customer orientation</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3397</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Auckland suburbs coronary study</field><field name="creator">Fraser, Gary E.</field><field name="description">The Auckland Suburbs Coronary Study is designed to provide information concerning acute coronary events in Auckland. Within New Zealand, information Previously depended on either hospital data or death certificate data. The present study is community based and has provided more extensive information than has previously been available. A random sample of 125 primary care doctors was selected. The patients of these doctors were considered a random sample of the community and formed the study population. The size of this population was estimated using a postal survey, taking names from the electoral roll. A statistical theory is developed to allow a confidence interval to be placed about the maximum likelihood estimate. Hypothesis testing theory is applied to the problem of comparing disease frequencies at different locations or at different times at the same location. During overlapping one year periods, 293 cases of definite myocardial infarction, 178 cases of sudden cardiac death and 99 cases of possible myocardial infarction were collected. Information concerning demographic variables, past and prodromal medical histories, the acute event, the electrocardiograph, cardiac enzymes, mortality within 28 days and postmortem results, was collected As about 80% of sudden deaths are all over before any help is sought and in view of the geographic nature of Auckland city the utility of &#8216;cardiac arrest&#8217; ambulances would not seem to be great. For sudden deaths surviving longer than five minutes after onset (about 50% of total) there was a significant tendency for there to be a lower social class predominance. This may imply inadequacies of acute health care--either availability or notification. Persons dying suddenly differed from persons experiencing definite myocardial infarction (but not dying suddenly) by experiencing less prodromal chest pain, taking digoxin and frusemide more frequently, consuming more alcohol and the acute event occurring in the cooler months proportionately more often. At postmortem, they had significantly more myocardial scarring and/or fibrosis. Persons experiencing definite myocardial infarction differed from persons experiencing possible myocardial infarction (who did not die suddenly) by being more likely a male, having less history of past acute coronary insufficiency, using less of beta-blocking drugs or frusemide/ethacrynic acid and describing prodromal lethargy less frequently. Clinical shock was more common in the acute phase and death more common in the succeeding 30 days. Persons dying suddenly differed from those suffering possible myocardial infarction (but not dying suddenly) by being older, more likely to be male and less likely to have had chest pain in the prodrome. The data could be interpreted as suggesting that a separate primary myocardial process is contributing towards sudden death. Alcohol may be a risk factor for sudden death. A hypothesis is, that in the presence of acute infarction, a history of chronic, moderate to high alcohol intake is associated with an increased likelihood of sudden death.</field><field name="date">1979</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3289</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Development and efficacy of cognitive behaviour therapy for multiple sclerosis fatigue: a randomised controlled trial</field><field name="creator">Van Kessel, Kirsten</field><field name="description">Aim Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is an unpredictable demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS), with fatigue being one of the least understood symptoms. Based on a systematic review of the literature, a cognitive behavioural model of MS fatigue was developed and used to design a manualised eight session cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) intervention to treat MS fatigue. The purpose of the randomized controlled trial (RCT) was to investigate the efficacy of CBT compared to relaxation training (RT) to treat fatigue in MS. Methods Seventy-two patients with MS fatigue were randomly assigned to either eight sessions of CBT or eight sessions of RT, designed to control for therapist time and attention. Participants were assessed before and after treatment, and at three and six months follow-up. Primary outcomes included the Fatigue Questionnaire (FQ) and the Clinical Global Impression Scale (CGIS). Secondary outcomes included measures of fatigue related impairment, mood, stress, sleep problems and daytime sleepiness. Seventy of the 72 participants completed all therapy sessions and 69 participants completed all assessments. Results Analyses were carried out by intention-to-heat. There was a significant group by time interaction for fatigue, indicating that the CBT group had significantly greater reductions in fatigue severity than the RT group (p&lt;.02). A-priori contrasts showed that this significant effect was largely accounted for by changes between baseline and end of treatment (P&lt;.00). By six month follow-up improvement in fatigue was equivalent in both groups. The key mechanism of improvement in fatigue severity during CBT was a positive change in schematic beliefs about fatigue. At the end of treatment 88.6% of the CBT group rated themselves as improved compared to 73% of the RT group, but this difference was not significant (p&lt;.09). Both groups improved on almost all secondary outcomes, with the CBT participants improving more significantly on depression, anxiety and stress between baseline and end of treatment (p&lt;.05). Conclusions CBT appears to be an effective treatment for MS fatigue, with CBT participants improving significantly more on fatigue than RT participants between baseline and end of treatment. Obtained effect sizes for fatigue in both CBT and RT were considerably larger than those in previous controlled trials of pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions. Both groups improved on almost all of the secondary outcomes. Findings support the relevance of a cognitive behavioural model for MS fatigue.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3313</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Gap junctions in the lens: is location everything?</field><field name="creator">Sisley, Aran Mathew George</field><field name="description">The primary function of the ocular lens is as a light-focusing structure. To this end the lens is avascular, with a highly ordered arrangement of cells that acts to reduce light scattering. However, the avascular nature of the lens presents the problem of supplying cells deep within the lens with nutrients and removing waste products of cellular metabolism, i.e. maintaining cellular homeostasis, To solve this problem the lens possesses intercellular channels, called gap junctions, that facilitate cell-to-cell communication and are regulated by changes in the subcellular distribution and age dependent processing of the gap junction protein subunits, called connexins. The lens expresses three types of connexins (Cx): Cx43 in the anterior surface epithelial cells and connexins 46 and 50 in the fibre cells. Therefore, to fully examine the role of GJs in lens homeostasis, regional differences in GJ structure and function need to be quantified. In this thesis I present the results of experiments designed to map the differentiation dependent changes to subcellular distribution and posttranslational processing of Cx46 and Cx50 in mouse and rat lenses. My results quantitatively show for the first time that Cx50 undergoes two discrete cleavage events in a similar manner to that previously shown for Cx46, and that qualitatively Cx46 does the same in the mouse lens' Such posttranslational processing has important effects on the proposed lens circulation model (Mathias et al., 1997) that accounts for lens homeostasis. In addition, I have examined the functional contribution of gap junctions to localized intercellular communication in different regions of wildtype and Cx46-KO mouse lenses, using highly localised uncaging of fluorescein with Two-Photon Excited Flash Photolysis (TPEFP) in half lenses, The results of these experiments have provided the first supporting evidence for a macromolecule-permeable pathway, previously suggested by Shestoplaov and Bassnett (2000, 2003), that acts in conjunction with gap junctions to facilitate intercellular communication in the lens core. My results show that this pathway acts at a localised level to confer cell-to-cell communication that is as effective as that mediated by gap junctions, and therefore a re-evaluation of current models of lens homeostasis is now required.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::320600 Medical Physiology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3292</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Intrauterine growth retardation in the rat: effects on the somatotrophic axis and postnatal sequelae</field><field name="creator">Woodall, Sonja Mary</field><field name="description">Over the past decade, a number of epidemiological studies have provided significant evidence that certain major adult noncommunicable diseases, such as hypertension, ischaemic heart disease and non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, may be associated with impaired fetal growth. This phenomenon has been termed "programming" which is essentially the term used for persisting changes in structure and function caused by undernutrition or other adverse influences acting during critical periods of early development. Programming has been used as the mechanistic basis to explain the long term sequelae of intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR). The mechanisms underlying the epidemiological observations remain to be elucidated and developed. While it is well established that severe maternal undernutrition during pregnancy leads to IUGR, there has been relatively little well defined animal studies of the somatotrophic axis and postnatal development of growth retarded offspring. The major objectives of this thesis were to establish a model in the rat of IUGR by nutritional restriction of the dam throughout gestation and to examine the effects of fetal growth retardation on endocrine, molecular and growth parameters during postnatal development. In addition, the development of an animal model for IUGR enabled well defined studies testing distinct hypotheses suggested by the epidemiological observations of professor David Barker and colleagues. Timed matings were performed in Wistar rats and dams were randomly assigned to one of two dietary treatment groups. A control group was fed ad libitum throughout pregnancy and a restricted group was fed 30% of ad libitum intake. Restricted fed dams were observed to lose a significant amount of body weight throughout gestation, due to undernutrition, but caught up to the ad libitum group during the lactating period. Maternal undernutrition significantly reduced fetal and placental weights without altering litter size. Postnatally, body weights of offspring from undernourished dams continued to be reduced until at least 18 weeks of age, although they were observed to be growing at the same rate as ad libitum offspring by 2 weeks of age. A cohort of animals from undernourished dams were maintained to measure blood pressure by tail cuff plethysmography. Offspring from undernourished dams were found to have significantly elevated systolic blood pressures from 18 weeks of age. This observation provides direct experimental support for the hypothesis, derived from human epidemiological studies, that the origin of adult hypertension may originate during fetal life as a result of exposure to a sub-optimal intrauterine environment. Parallel reductions in plasma IGF-I and hepatic IGF-I mRNA concentrations before 15 days of age were also observed in growth retarded offspring. Hepatic IGF-I transcription start sites within exon 1 and exon 2 were coordinately reduced with IUGR up to 15 days of age without changes in GHR and GHBP mRNA abundance. The lack of catch-up growth observed in the IUGR offspring despite normalization of their plasma IGF-I and IGF-I mRNA levels from 15 days of age may be due to a state of partial resistance to GH. This observation lead to a series of treatment studies in which neonatal and juvenile offspring from ad libitum and undernourished dams were treated with growth factors to investigate somatic growth responses as a measure for hormone sensitivity. In both treatment studies, ad libitum offspring from both age groups and juvenile IUGR offspring responded to GH treatment However, neonatal IUGR offspring did not exhibit any response to GH treatment.. Analysis of IGF-I gene expression in neonatal offspring showed that GH treatment elevated IGF-I Eb mRNA in ad libitum but not IUGR offspring. These results suggest a possible mechanism for transient GH resistance in that a post-receptor defect in GH action may contribute to the development of temporary postnatal GH resistance as a consequence of IUGR and fetal programming of IGF-I gene expression. In summary, the development of a model of IUGR in the rat using maternal undernutrition throughout gestation has enabled detailed investigation of nutritional regulation of the somatotrophic axis during fetal development and postnatal sequelae. The studies in this thesis have shown that the somatotrophic axis is markedly altered postnatally by nutritional restriction of the dam throughout gestation, leading to prolonged postnatal growth retardation and elevated blood pressure The mechanisms which lead to the induction of such fetal programming and whether these changes may contribute to the development of subsequent adult-onset disease remain to be addressed in future studies.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321000 Clinical Sciences::321019 Paediatrics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3314</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Psychological investigations of the experience of chronic pain</field><field name="creator">James, Frances Ruth</field><field name="description">This thesis is based on two theoretical models of chronic illness: Large, Butler, James, and Peters (1990) introduced a systems model of musculo-skeletal pain which incorporated many of the variables believed to be important in the development and maintenance of pain. Feldman&#8217;s model (1974) addressed the difficulties of adapting to chronic illness. Five studies evaluated specific aspects of these models. The epidemiology of pain in New Zealand (NZ) was derived from a psychiatric epidemiology project. Approximately 80% of NZ adults had experienced a life disrupting episode of pain which had required medical consultation. Subjects who reported episodes of pain were more likely to have psychiatric diagnoses of anxiety, depression, and phobia. They were more likely to describe their health as poor and were currently consulting their doctor more than people who did not report an experience of pain. The estimated average cost of health consulting by people attending Auckland Hospital Pain Clinic (AHPC) for the previous year was $1333(NZ). Most people had some subsidy of costs. The health consulting of the AHPC group was higher than that reported in the NZ health literature. Self image and the experience of pain were assessed in two studies. The first asked subjects at AHPC to describe the typical thoughts, feelings, and behaviours, of someone with chronic pain. Subjects described loss of self esteem, alienation from family and friends, fear of the future, frustration and anger. The descriptions focused on psychological aspects of the experience of pain. The second study of self image used repertory grid technique. Two standardised Illness Self Construct Repertory Grids (ISCRG) were evaluated. Issues in the use of standardised grids are discussed and some aspects of ISCRG application are explored. The two ISCRG indicated subjects often identified themselves as a physically ill person and felt isolated from others. People with pain and their "closest other&#8221; (CO) completed the ISCRG(A) and questionnaires on the quality of their relationship. Closest others overestimated the role of the physical illness in their partners&#8217; life and believed that they understood them better than the individual with pain thought they did. The personality dimensions of alexithymia and hypnotisability have been hypothesised as pathways for the development of psychosomatic illness. Individuals with chronic pain were tested to establish whether they weremore alexithymic and more hypnotisable than subjects in a general population control group. This was not verified. The constructs of alexithymia and hypnotisability require critical examination. The experience of pain is common and is associated with psychological distress and high health service use. Self construct appears to be a major factor determining response to pain and to treatment programmes. Chronic pain appears to be a particular challenge for individuals who must accept alteration in their lifestyle with perhaps little understanding of what the future may hold.</field><field name="date">1991</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321000 Clinical Sciences::321021 Psychiatry</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3291</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Purinergic signalling in peripheral auditory neurotransmission</field><field name="creator">Salih, Salam Gheyath Al-Din</field><field name="description">P2X receptors, forming ATP-gated ion channels, mediate fast neurotransmission in the central, peripheral and autonomic nervous systems. Preliminary evidence indicated the presence of P2X receptors in the cochlea, with a possible involvement in the neurohumoral regulation of hearing function. This study investigated the hypothesis that extracellular ATP acts as an auditory neurotransmitter or neuromodulator within the inner ear. RT-PCR analysis of rat spiral ganglion neurones (SGN), which innervate the sensory hair cells of the cochlea, detected the expression of three different isoforms of the P2X2 receptor subunit, including a novel functional isoform (designated P2X2-3R). Cellular localisation of the P2X2R subunit mRNA in SGN somata was demonstrated by direct in situ RT-PCR. Furthermore, immunocytochemistry studies using P2X2 receptor-specific antisera, confirmed the expression of the P2X2R protein by SGN somata, and also showed localisation at the region of spiral ganglion neurone synapse with the inner and outer hair cells. Whole-cell patch clamp recordings from cultured post-natal rat SGN demonstrated ATP-activated currents with heterogeneous phenotypes. This is consistent with the functional expression of P2X2R subunit isoforms, and co-expression of additional P2X receptor subunits. However, in situ recordings, using a rat cochlear slice preparation, demonstrated a homogeneous phenotype of ATP-gated current, suggesting heteromultimeric assembly of P2X receptor subunits that is specifically regulated in vivo. Employing a multi-disciplinary approach, the present study provides substantial evidence for a purinergic mode of neurotransmission within the peripheral auditory system. This occurs via ATP-gated ion channels in spiral ganglion neurones, arising from a tightly regulated expression of a specific P2X receptor phenotype.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3316</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Myocardial force and intracellular Ca2+ in an animal model of hypertensive heart failure</field><field name="creator">Ward, Marie-Louise</field><field name="description">Hypertensive heart failure has long been associated with diminished cardiac contractile function, yet the underlying cellular mechanisms are not well understood. The aim of this Thesis was to investigate the relationship between intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i) and isometric force during the relatively narrow time frame in which long-standing compensated hypertrophy progresses to decompensated end-stage heart failure in an animal model of human essential hypertension. In order to carry out this aim, left ventricular trabeculae were utilized from failing hearts of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and their normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) controls. At a physiological stimulation frequency (5 Hz), and temperature (37 &#176;C), the peak stress of SHR trabeculae was significantly reduced compared to WKY, although no differences in the time-course of the twitch were detected. Measurements using fura-2/AM as an index of intracellular [Ca2+] showed that, for SHR, both the peak of the Ca2+ transient and the resting [Ca2+]i were increased and the decay of the Ca2+ transient was prolonged compared to WKY. This unexpected result, i.e. depression of twitch force despite an increased Ca2+ transient, was investigated further by utilizing experimental protocols known to affect [Ca2+]i and force. Varying extracellular calcium ([Ca2+]o) between 0.5 and 5 mM showed that the reduction of force development by SHR trabeculae was not associated with reduced myofilament Ca2+ sensitivity, since, although peak [Ca2+]i continued to increase with increasing [Ca2+]o, peak stress reached a plateau. Investigation of the force-frequency response between 0.2 and 10 Hz showed that the mismatch in peak Ca2+ and peak force was apparent across all frequencies for SHR. A consistent finding of studies that have made measurement of [Ca2+]i in failing myocardium is that the decay of intracellular Ca2+ following SR release is prolonged. Additionally, expression levels of the SR Ca2+ -ATPase have been reported as reduced, in conjunction with increased expression of the sarcolemmal Na+/Ca2+ exchanger. Although the decay of fluorescence was slower for SHR in this study, no experimental evidence was found to suggest that sarcolemmal Ca2+ extrusion was increased in SHR in comparison to WKY. The re-circulation fraction of activator Ca2+ during recovery from potentiation was not different between rat strains, indicating that SL Ca2+ extrusion was not increased in SHR. Additionally, the decay of fluorescence remained slower for SHR even when the SR Ca2+ -ATPase contribution was functionally removed. Inhibition of the SL Ca2+ -ATPase, together with the functional removal of the SR, removed the differences in the decay of fluorescence between rat strains. A decrease in the sarcolemmal extrusion of [Ca2+]i by the Ca2+ -.ATPase might therefore explain the observed differences in the resting [Ca2+]i and in the amplitude of the Ca2+ transient between rat strains. In summary, this study has provided the first measurements of [Ca2+]i and isometric force carried out at physiological temperature and stimulation frequency in LV trabeculae from failing SHR hearts and their age-matched, normotensive, WKY controls. Most importantly, for this animal model the contractile dysfunction typical of heart failure is not associated with reduced availabilty of [Ca2+]i. Instead it is suggested that contractile function is compromised in these LV trabeculae by the increased collagen, and its three-dimensional organisation.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::320600 Medical Physiology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3294</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Accounting information cues and share price revisions</field><field name="creator">Emanuel, D.M (David Munroe), 1944-</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates the impact of certain identifiable subsets of accounting information on users&#8217; decisions by examining share price revisions that occurred at the same time as the accounting information was released. The subsets examined are the announcements of new share issues, the release of contemporaneous earnings and dividend announcements, and the release of information about asset revaluations. Assuming that an adequate methodology can be designed, a significant share price revision is consistent with the notion that the accounting information cue has "information content". The distinction between accounting research and research in the basic disciplines of economics and mathematics/statistics is the emphasis in accounting on the institutional domain; that is research in accounting requires a "mapping" into the institutional domain in which accounting information is produced and used. This, in turn, provides a justification for the type of announcement effect studies described in the previous paragraph. Clearly the study of share price revisions requires a substantial data base of share prices. Part of this thesis is devoted to a description of the procedures used to establish this data base. The three major announcement effect studies use what is popularly described as the market model residual method of analysis. In the application of this model, some attention has been paid to problems of "thin" trading in the New Zealand environment in providing unbiased estimators of the market model parameters. The results of the application of this methodology are that share prices seem to react rapidly and (generally) unbiasedly to the announcement of bonus issues and contemporaneous earnings and dividend announcements. The size of the reaction in the week that the announcement is made is typically large. The larger is the unexpected component in the announcement of earnings, the larger is the share price revision. With regard to rights issues, no abnormal share price performance was found in the week that the rights issue was announced, although it was clear that companies announcing rights issues had been performing abnormally well over the year up to the announcement. Share price revisions did not appear to accompany the release of information about the current values of assets (usually land and buildings). However it is conceded that this subset of the overall research exercise is more difficult to undertake as there are difficulties in determining an appropriate announcement date, and in determining what the market&#8217;s expectations are with regard to the revaluation.</field><field name="date">1983</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350100 Accounting, Auditing and Accountability</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3319</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Thermoreception, thermoregulation and the early thermal environment</field><field name="creator">Young, Andrew</field><field name="description">Previous investigations1,2 have shown that the capacity of rats and rabbits reared at an elevated environmental temperature to thermoregulate in the cold is impaired. This impairment appears permanent and is associated with other thermoregulatory dysfunction (altered febrile response and altered response to intrahypothalamic noradrenaline injection). The present study investigated the role of the thermal environment in the development of thermoregulatory function by studying the performance of the intact thermoregulatory system and components thereof at different levels of processing of thermal information (thermoreceptive, early integrative and effector levels). The present study confirmed the impaired capacity of heat-reared rats to maintain colonic temperature in the cold and future indicated that this was likely to be attributable to active rather than passive components of the thermoregulatory system. Exposure to an environmental temperature of 20&#176;C for 20 days was able to prevent thermoregulatory dysfunction (as assessed by intrahypothalamic noradrenaline injection) if it occurred after about 14 days of age. Exposure to 20&#176;C was progressively less effective in averting thermoregulatory dysfunction after about 60-80 days of age. The experimental design identified these effects as being of environmental rather than genetic origin. Thermal information processing at the level of the caudal trigeminal nucleus resembled that described at thermoreceptors. The static and dynamic responses of thermoreceptive neurones at this level were quantified and found not to differ between 20&#176;C &#8211; and 30&#176;C-reared rats. The distribution of facial thermal receptive fields and the projections of these at the caudal trigeminal nucleus were mapped and also found not to differ. Thermal information originating from truncal skin was intercepted at a midline midbrain level. Data presented here suggested that the sites at which this thermal information could be intercepted included but probably were not restricted to the raphe nuclci. Both warm- and cold-responsive units were present at the midbrain. The abundance of thermoresponsive units was the same in 20&#176;C- and 30&#176;C-reared rat as was the ratio of warm:cold-responsive units. The stimulus configurations by which responses of midbrain thermoresponsive units could be characterised were more complex than at the caudal trigeminal nuclcus. Thermal responses were principally static with little response to temperature change. The pooled static responses of warm- and cold-responsive units over the 5-45&#176;C range were the same in 20&#176;C- and 30&#176;C-reared rats. The cutaneous receptive fields at the midbrain level were diffuse, covering most of the truncal surface. There was an almost universal and consistent interaction with noxious input at midbrain thermoresponsive units. Warm-responsive units were inhibited by simultaneous noxious stimulation at almost any body site while the activity of cold-responsive units was augmented by such stimulation. At the thermoeffector level, noradrenaline-induced thermogenesis was equal in 20&#176;C- and 30&#176;C- reared rats. Heat-rearing was not observed to produce identifiable effects on the peripheral processing of thermal information, either at the afferent or efferent limbs of the thermoregulatory system. Heat-rearing does however produce changes in thermophysiological responses that are primarily mediated via a central mechanism (responses to intrahypothalamic noradrenaline, febrile response). It is therefore surmised that alterations in thermoregulatory function following heat-rearing are attributable to changes in central rather than peripheral processing of thermal information. 1 Cooper et al., (1980) J Physiol [ Lond ] 303: 165-172 2 Ferguson et al., (1981) Can J Physiol Pharmacol 59: 91-95</field><field name="date">1985</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::320600 Medical Physiology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3293</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Multiple-schedule performance in closed economies</field><field name="creator">Elliffe, Douglas Mark</field><field name="description">Experimental preparations may be divided into two categories, called open and closed economies. In an open economy, the extent to which the subject is deprived of the scheduled reinforcer, most commonly food, is controlled by the experimenter. This is usually done by manipulating the amount of free food given to the subject after each experimental session. Consumption of the reinforcer is thus independent of behaviour during the session. By contrast, in a closed economy, no alternative source of the reinforcer is available outside the session. Consumption of the reinforcer is thus completely determined by the subject&#8217;s interaction with the experimental environment. This may be done by having the subject live permanently within the experiment and receive all its food as reinforcers for responding on continuously available schedules. Most research in the experimental analysis of behaviour has been carried out within open economies, but it can be argued that the natural environment, as a whole, is better represented by a closed economy. Several experimental findings obtained within open economies have been shown not to be replicable within closed economies. In the present series of experiments, three pigeons received their total daily intake of food as reinforcers for responding on continuously available multiple variable-interval schedules. The relation between the allocation of responding between components of a multiple schedule and the distribution of reinforcers can be conveniently described by the generalised matching law, which states that the ratio of component response rates is a power function of the ratio of component reinforcer rates. In an open economy, the power, called sensitivity, is typically less than 1.0. This is called undermatching. Experiment 1 of the present series found sensitivity values substantially greater than 1.0.This is called overmatching. One procedural variable known to control sensitivity in open economies is level of deprivation. Experiments 2 to 5 examined the effect of deprivation in a closed economy. In Experiments 2 and 3, increasing deprivation by means of decreasing session duration produced decreases in sensitivity. In Experiment 4, increasing deprivation by decreasing overall reinforcer rate in continuous sessions had no effect on sensitivity. In Experiment 5, deprivation was held constant by changing session duration and overall reinforcer rate in opposite directions. Sensitivity increased with increasing session duration and decreasing overall reinforcer rate. Taken together, these results suggest that multiple-schedule sensitivity increases with decreasing deprivation, with decreasing overall reinforcer rate, and as the economy for reinforcers other than those arranged by the experimenter (extraneous reinforcers) becomes more closed. A quantitative model of multiple-schedule performance, elaborated from that of McLean and White (1983), was developed to account for these effects. In this model, response allocation is governed by the concurrent choice between scheduled-and extraneous-reinforcer rates within each component. The total rate of extraneous reinforcement is affected by both deprivation and economy, and the distribution of extraneous reinforcers between components depends inversely on the distribution of scheduled reinforcers. Unlike other published models, this model predicts overmatching in the present experiments. Quantitatively, the model accounts for both the present closed-economy data and published data from open-economy multiple schedules as well as does the generalised matching law, and better than does its most influential competitor, Herrnstein&#8217;s (1970) equation. Finally, it is proposed that, while the economy for scheduled reinforcers is important to understanding total response output on multiple schedules, the economy for extraneous reinforcers has much more influence on the allocation of that responding between components.</field><field name="date">1990</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3312</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Models of electrocortical dynamics</field><field name="creator">Liley, David T. J.</field><field name="description">Computational and continuum models of electrocortical activity are developed in order to better understand the genesis and significance of the major mammalian cerebral rhythms. The computational model was developed to investigate the relationship between individual neuron behaviour and population electrical dynamics. Networks of multicompartment excitatory and inhibitory neurons incorporating &#8220;fast" synaptic transmission were coupled together using an anatomically derived scheme of asymmetric intracortical axosynaptic connectivity. Results showed that such networks are capable of oscillating at frequencies frequently observed in mammalian electroencephalogram (EEG). The relationship of individual neuron behaviour to mean network activity was investigated by generating Conditional Pulse Probability Surfaces. Derived results exhibited a near linear relationship between the probability of a pyramidal cell firing and the extant value of the local field potential (LFP), similar to that seen in experimental studies involving cortical neurons. In contrast the continuum model considered neural tissue to be a continuous one-dimensional chain of excitatory and inhibitory neurons interacting by way of short (intra-cortical) and long (isotropic cortico-cortical) fibres. The defining non-linear integral equations were linearised such that Fourier-Laplace techniques could be applied to investigate potential solutions. Numerical solutions revealed the prescence of, spatially, weakly damped travelling waves at or near the frequencies of mammalian alpha (8-13 Hz). Biasing the excitatory cell population was shown to have a dominant effect in determining spatio-temporal damping of travelling wave solutions, whereas applying bias to the inhibitory cell population had a dominant effect in specifying the corresponding spatio-temporal frequencies. The possibility that such bias may be due to, and regulated by, subcortical efferents is discussed. Finally it is suggested that the alpha rhythm may be an important synchronising agent for coordinating widespread cortical activity.</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3320</field></doc><doc><field name="title">High frequency power transistor model</field><field name="creator">Egan, Brian</field><field name="description">The development of a large-signal power transistor model applicable at radio frequencies is described. This model which has its basis in the classical large-signal models is valid for cut-off and active region operation but does not include saturation operation. The model is intended primarily for use in broadband linear radio frequency amplifier applications and is useful up to frequencies of the order of 1/15 f&#9516;. The model is described by two first order nonlinear differential equations and a number of algebraic equations. Equation coefficients are determined from measurements made on the devices under study. Two methods are described for the solution of the model equations. The first and principal method is an iterative one requiring computer assistance whilst the second is analytical and depends upon piecewise linearisation of the device transfer characteristic. This analytical method whilst in some respects inadequate, e.g. distortion level predictions, is easy to implement and despite its limitations affords useful insight into output power capability and frequency limitations of specific devices. The model contains all transistor nonlinearities and parasitic elements of significance and an important feature is the inclusion of device temperature as a model variable, resulting in good accuracy over a wide range of operating conditions. A simplified input impedance representation is evolved and it is demonstrated that input impedance measurements provide a useful window on model structure and aid in the evaluation of parameter values.</field><field name="date">1976</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3321</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of some of the factors concerned in the natural regeneration of the kauri (Agathis australis)</field><field name="creator">Mirams, Rex Valentine, 1925-</field><field name="description">New Zealand is a land with a unique and very diversified flora which, along with the great range of habitats to be found throughout the country, has given rise to some remarkable plant communities.

Bowlby&#8217;s (1982) attachment theory implies that optimal outcomes are associated with an attachment relationship that is characterised by a confidence in the accessibility and responsiveness of the caregiver. Three studies were designed to explore changes in New Zealand adolescents&#8217; perceptions of their attachment to mothers, fathers, and friends, and the relative impact of these relationships on three measures of self esteem. Two dimensions of the attachment relationship were assessed, the utilisation of emotional support and proximity, and the quality of affect. Study 1 (n = 180) revealed that although adolescents utilised their mothers for support and proximity more than their fathers, and perceived their mothers as more responsive than fathers, they did not differ in their quality of affect towards their parents. Friends were utilised significantly more in support seeking situations than in proximity seeking situations. Study 2 (n = 493) revealed that male and female adolescents differed in their perceptions of their attachment to mothers in late adolescence. With increasing age, females reported that they would utilise maternal support and proximity more, whereas males reported utilising their mothers less in both types of situation. However, both male and female adolescents continued to report a high quality of affect towards their mothers throughout adolescence. No differences were found in male and female adolescents' perceptions of their attachment to fathers. With increasing age, males and females utilised paternal support and proximity less, and reported a lower quality of affect towards their fathers. Adolescents continued to utilise their friends highly for support throughout adolescence, and increased their utilisation of friends for proximity as they got older. Regardless of age, females reported a higher quality of affect towards their friends than males. These findings suggested that substantial changes take place in attachment relationships from early to late adolescence, and that these changes are affected by the sex of the adolescent and the sex of the parent. Further analyses revealed that Pacific Island adolescents utilised their mothers significantly less for support than European/Pakeha adolescents. Adolescents from one-parent families utilised their fathers significantly less for support and proximity, and had a lower quality of affect towards them than adolescents from two-parent families. The utilisation of support and proximity from mothers, fathers, and friends was minimally related to overall self esteem, coping abilities and social competence. The quality of affect towards mothers and fathers was significantly related to all three measures of self esteem, whereas the quality of affect towards friends was significantly related only to social competence. Adolescent attachment to parents appears to exert a relatively stronger effect on self esteem than adolescent attachment to friends, regardless of the sex or age of the adolescent. Study 3 (n = 80) examined the main reasons for utilising parents and friends for emotional support, and for feeling close to parents and friends. Content analysis revealed that the reasons did not differ according to the age or sex of the adolescent but varied according to the attachment figure. Overall, the three studies revealed that New Zealand adolescents&#8217; descriptions of their relationships with parents and friends differed at both the cognitive-affective and behavioural levels of attachment. The divergent patterns of support seeking and proximity seeking highlighted these differences, and clearly illustrated the need to distinguish these two aspects of the behavioural dimension of attachment in adolescence. The implications of the findings for adolescent attachment to parents and friends are considered, and future directions for research are discussed.</field><field name="date">1993</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3317</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Application of the double torsion specimen to the study of fracture in fibre reinforced plastics</field><field name="creator">Brown, Niven Rhys</field><field name="description">The increasing use of fibre reinforced polymers in structural components often requires an accurate assessment of the strength of the component. The strength of composite materials is usually based on the strength of an individual lamina. This is then combined in a manner depending on the orientation of the plies within the laminate. The actual failure process is often ignored in this type of analysis. Composite failure is the result of damage accumulation from a number of failure modes, in particular, fibre failure, matrix failure and failure of the interface between the fibres and matrix. Measurement of the interfacial strength requires specialised testing techniques in order to obtain accurate characterization of the interfacial failure processes. This research uses a double torsion specimen reinforced with fibres in a number of configurations. The testing techniques developed allow the interaction of a matrix crack with fibres, resulting in the failure of the interface. Finite element analysis has been used to gain an insight into the deformation mechanisms. A compliance change analysis has been developed so that the load in the fibres can be calculated. Results from the finite element analysis confirm the analytical procedures and show that, for the fibre/resin combination tested, the interface has a lower fracture toughness than the matrix material. The interaction between the fibres and matrix shows that the mechanism of fibre bridging inhibits the propagation of matrix cracks. This produces an apparent increase in the toughness of the composite system. To confirm the failure processes occurring, the technique of acoustic emission has been used to monitor the development of the specimen failure. In line with other workers, it is shown that matrix failure produces low amplitude events and interfacial failure produces mid amplitude events. Fibre failure did not occur to any significant degree. This thesis shows how the contribution from the presence of an interface affects the fracture of composite materials and how, via the reinforced double torsion specimen, this contribution can be measured and interpreted.</field><field name="date">1993</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3323</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of active filters: including design limitations imposed by operational amplifier characteristics</field><field name="creator">Kay, John Stephen</field><field name="description">The aim of this thesis is the development of an understanding of some of the Limitations involved in the design of active filters.

(Christopher Michael), 1974-ichael</field><field name="description">This thesis examined the relative importance of natural and human influences to the population and assemblage dynamics of reef fishes in northeastern New Zealand. In particular, how different reef fishes responded to the implementation of no-take and partial marine reserve protection, and physical factors responsible for spatial differences in fish abundance. Included were data from prior to the establishment of a no-take marine reserve, multiple fished reference locations, biannual sampling and the use of two independent methods to provide quantitative estimates of fish abundance and size. This combination of factors is rare in studies of marine reserves was an important strategy leading to an improved understanding of the mechanisms structuring fish communities. Responses of the reef fish assemblage to changes in fishing mortality were examined at the Poor Knights Islands Marine Reserve. Full no-take marine reserve protection was implemented on the 1st Oct 1998 but for the prior 17 years, the Poor Knights Reserve comprised only two small no-take zones and allowed recreational fishing in the rest of the reserve. Following implementation of no-take marine reserve status the reef fish community changed rapidly; there were no obvious changes at either reference location. Species targeted by fishers, such as Pagrus auratus (snapper) and Caprodon longimanus (pink maomao), responded most strongly to protection. An increase in the density of some non-targeted species can probably be attributed to climatic effects, rather than a reduction in fishing pressure. A decline in the abundance of several species at the Poor Knights may have been a result of natural mortality, or competitive or predatory interactions with snapper. Along with human influences (fishing), physical variables are important in determining the distribution and abundance of reef fish. Four locations (two mainland and two island) were surveyed in northeastern New Zealand to determine spatial patterns for seven labrid species, one of the most abundant and widespread taxa of reef fish in New Zealand. The underlying mechanisms were then explored through an examination of the relationship between swimming ability (as examined through pectoral fin morphology), exposure and depth. Each of the four locations consistently displayed distinct labrid assemblages, likely due to the influence of the East Auckland Current. Regardless of location, there was a consistent depthrelated trend for most labrids and a trend for some species to be associated with certain levels of wave exposure. By analogy with tropical labrid assemblages, it was expected that there would be a clear relationship between pectoral fin aspect ratio and depth and/or exposure. However, this relationship was not strongly evident suggesting that wave exposure may not be as important for labrids on northeastern New Zealand reefs as hypothesised for tropical coral reef systems. The response of snapper, an important recreational and commercial finfish, was investigated following the cessation of all fishing at the Poor Knights. The rate of response of snapper to protection was rapid, in areas that had previously been partially protected as well as in those that had been fully protected from fishing, with the overall density of legal sized fish increasing by 7.4 times over 4 years, likely a result of recolonisation rather than recruitment. The 818% increase in snapper biomass has the potential to enhance areas outside or within the reserve through the export of biomass (eggs and/or larvae and adults) - the daily batch fecundity was 11 to 18 times higher at the Poor Knights compared to the reference locations. The effects of partial protection on reef fish were further examined at the Mimiwhangata Marine Park, an area where recreational fishing is permitted but all commercial fishing has been prohibited for 18 years. Snapper showed no difference in abundance or size between the Mimiwhangata Marine Park and adjacent control areas, with the density of snapper most similar to fished reference locations. The lack of any recovery by snapper within the Marine Park, despite the exclusion of commercial fishers and restrictions on recreational fishing, and results from the Poor Knights, indicates that partial fishing regulations are ineffective as conservation tools for protecting targeted species or for fish communities in general (i.e. through reduction in by-catch). Results from this study provide evidence that recreational fishing has significant impacts on reef fishes.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270700 Ecology and Evolution::270702 Marine and estuarine ecology (incl. marine ichthyology)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3325</field></doc><doc><field name="title">M&#257;ori parents at school: the role of the M&#257;ori parent community in the delivery of te reo M&#257;ori school curriculum</field><field name="creator">Stewart, Alexander George</field><field name="description">This thesis represents the results of a three-year intervention study of a group of M&#257;ori language teachers, their pupils and M&#257;ori parent communities in the Northland region of New Zealand. The study was motivated by the problem of continuing low academic achievement for M&#257;ori students in state mainstream schools. The assumption that existing teaching outputs of M&#257;ori language were quite strong and so could be used to model improvements for other school subjects and teachers to follow for M&#257;ori students was examined. In fact this was found to be a mistaken assumption as serious problems were located for the teaching of the M&#257;ori language. Two school policy areas were examined to locate possible solutions: Treaty of Waitangi policies in school charters and the operation of M&#257;ori Language Resourcing. It was found that the operation by school managements tended to exclude any active role for the M&#257;ori parent community. An action research model of intervention was designed and implemented to offer teachers in-service assistance in the provision of practice examinations to help better prepare students in their school certificate written examinations. Teachers were also encouraged to work directly with their M&#257;ori parent communities in order to improve teaching, student learning and outcomes. A case-study demonstrates that a dramatic rise in pupil performance occurred when parents worked along side the teacher in the classroom. The thesis argues that the nature of the Treaty of Waitangi provides a rationale for M&#257;ori parent participation, for direct involvement into school management (teaching issues) both for M&#257;ori students and the M&#257;ori language. It is concluded that a successful school for M&#257;ori students depends both the strength and shape of the tripartite relationship between the school, the home and the students.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3327</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Adaptation of Cambodians in New Zealand: achievement, cultural identity and community development</field><field name="creator">Liev, Man Hau</field><field name="description">This thesis has two foci: how Cambodians with a refugee background manage their new life in Aotearoa/New Zealand, and how an identity as a Khmer Kiwi transnational community has developed. Analytic concepts&#8212; such as forced migration, cultural bereavement, adaptation, integration, diaspora, transnationalism, identification, and community of practice&#8212; are used to trace the trajectory of the contemporary way of life of Cambodians, their community development, and their cultural identity. The data gathered from mixedmethod research reveal the various opinions, strategies, coping mechanisms, and paths that Cambodian participants have adopted in order to adapt to life in New Zealand and still maintain their Khmer heritage. The majority of participants were proud of their personal achievements, and now have found normalcy in their new life. Individual struggles to engage and integrate with multicultural New Zealand society have required negotiation and protection of group interests, and inevitably some of these have resulted in conflicts and fragmentation within the Khmer community. Religious practice, organisation, and leadership became the main driving forces for asserting Khmer community identity. Collective memory was harnessed to deal with shared cultural bereavement, and the quest for belonging lent momentum to the community&#8217;s development and management of its identity. Khmer Theravada Buddhism has emerged as a means by which the majority of Cambodians can achieve their spiritual wellbeing, and has become a platform for various community identity developments within the New Zealand social and legal contexts. Gender roles and structures are a significant part of community development and of my analysis. This development of Khmer identity in New Zealand is a new strand of Khmer identity: Khmer heritage, transnational experience, and &#8216;Kiwi-ism&#8217;. Such transformation of identity reflects geo-political influences on integration in the form of belonging to and identifying with two or more groups. For example, the majority of participants proudly identified themselves as Khmer Kiwis. Their transnational lives have been enriched by their country of origin (Cambodia) and their country of residence (Aotearoa/New Zealand).

Using unbonded post-tensioning, walls are vertically prestressed by means of strands or bars which are passed through vertical ducts inside the walls. As the walls are subjected to lateral displacements (in-plane loading), gaps form at the horizontal joints, reducing the system stiffness. As long as the prestressing strands are kept within the elastic limit, or at least maintain a considerable amount of the initial prestressing force, they can provide a restoring force, which will return the walls to their original alignment upon unloading. The key feature in this behaviour is attributable to the tendons being unbonded over the entire wall height, allowing for distribution of tendon strain over the entire length of the tendon. An extensive literature review found that post-tensioning of masonry has had limited application in seismic areas and that there currently are no specific code requirements for it&#8217;s use for ductile seismic design, largely as a consequence of little knowledge about the ductility capacity and energy dissipation characteristics. It was concluded that structural testing of PCM walls and concrete masonry creep and shrinkage testing were essential to advance the understanding of this construction type. Creep and shrinkage experiments confirmed that long term prestress losses are considerable in both grouted and ungrouted concrete masonry, and must be taken into account in design. It was concluded that it is essential to use high strength steel for prestressing of PCM in order to reduce long term losses. Structural testing confirmed that fully grouted unbonded post-tensioned concrete masonry is a competent material combination for ductile structural wall systems. In particular, PCM walls strengthened in the flexural compression zones with confining plates are expected to successfully withstand severe ground shaking from an earthquake. It was suggested that partially and ungrouted PCM walls may suitably be used in strength design (non-ductile). The proposed prediction method for wall in-plane behaviour was validated by experimental results. Good correlation between predictions and results was found. Displacement spectra were developed for ductile seismic design of PCM walls. These can be used to accurately estimate the displacement demand imposed on multi-storey PCM cantilever walls.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3330</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Network event detection with entropy measures</field><field name="creator">Eimann, Raimund E.

Network streams are an example for such discrete information sources. This thesis investigates the use of information measures for the detection of events in network streams. Starting with the fundamental entropy and complexity measures proposed by Shannon and Kolmogorov, it reviews a range of candidate information measures for network event detection, including algorithms from the Lempel-Ziv family and a relative newcomer, the T-entropy. Using network trace data from the University of Auckland, the thesis demonstrates experimentally that these measures are in principle suitable for the detection of a wide range of network events. Several key parameters influence the detectability of network events with information measures. These include the amount of data considered in each traffic sample and the choice of observables. Among others, a study of the entropy behaviour of individual observables in event and non-event scenarios investigates the optimisation of these parameters. The thesis also examines the impact of some of the detected events on different information measures. This motivates a discussion on the sensitivity of various measures. A set of experiments demonstrating multi-dimensional network event classification with multiple observables and multiple information measures concludes the thesis.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Information Theory</field><field name="subject">Entropy</field><field name="subject">Network Events</field><field name="subject">Anomaly Detection</field><field name="subject">Network Event Detection</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3427</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies on the life cycles of two species of forcipulate starfish (Echinodermata, Asteroidea) from New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Barker, Michael Francis</field><field name="description">Annual reproductive cycles and the related changes in the pyloric caeca of the New Zealand starfish Stichaster australis and Coscinasterias calamaria (Echinodermata, Asteroidea) were determined at Maori Bay on the west coast of Auckland. Both species were shown to have clearly defined reproductive and pyloric caeca cycles, closely repeated from year to year. Pyloric caeca cycles showed an approximate although slightly displaced inverse relationship to gonad cycles. Changes in the gonad shown by histological sections confirmed these cycles. In addition to sexual reproduction C. calamaria may reproduce asexually by autotomy. Frequency of asexual reproduction did not vary seasonally and may be related to physiological stress or mechanical damage. Oocytes of S. australis and C. calamaria were fertilized in the laboratory and the resulting larvae reared through to metamorphosed starfish. The methods used in larval culture and embryological and larval development are described. Larvae of S. australis and C. calamaria closely resemble the larvae of Asterias rubens, described by Gemmill (1914), and of other planktotrophic asteroid larvae. Abnormal larvae found in some cultures are thought to result from, unsuitable culture conditions. It was found that oocytes of both species could be cross fertilized with sperm of the other. The settling behaviour was described and substrate preferences of advanced brachiolaria larvae of S. australis and C. calamaria were determined with larvae reared in the laboratory. These results were correlated with field observations of habitat preferences of juvenile starfish. C. calamaria larvae settled on almost any hard substratum provided it was coated with a primary film. Recently metamorphosed C. calamaria could not be located at Maori Bay and it is inferred that there is low recruitment from the plankton to the Maori Bay population. S. australis larvae would only settle, metamorphose and feed on the encrusting coralline alga Mesophyllum insigne. Nursery areas of offshore boulders covered with this alga were located at Maori Bay and these were found to support populations of juvenile starfish. Mesophyllum insigne appears to provide a stable and abundant food source for juvenile S. australis. The structure of the brachiolar arms and adhesive disc of S. australis and C. calamaria was determined from light microscopy and from scanning and transmission electron microscopy. The structure of these organs was very similar in S. australis and C. calamaria. The brachiolar arms are comprised of a stem region terminating in a crown of adhesive papillae. Adhesive papillae are made up of a variety of secretory cell types. Principal among these are elongated cells producing very electron dense secretory particles. These are released at the free cell surface attached to cilia. secretory particles appear to be important in temporary attachment of the brachiolar arms to the substratum. Ciliary sense cells, possibly used in the recognition of specific substrates are located at the tip of adhesive papillae. The adhesive disc is comprised of large cells packed with secretory droplets and elongated intracellular fibres. In the attached adhesive disc secretory droplets have been lost, having formed the cement attaching the disc to the substratum. The intracellular fibres are the principal anchoring structures running from the disc surface microvilli (locked into the attachment cement) to the underlying connective tissue of the attachment stalk. S. australis juveniles reared in the laboratory were maintained on Mesophyllum insigne substrata and the growth rates and feeding behaviour of individual starfish was determined. Growth of yearly settlement cohorts on a nursery site on the shore used in conjunction with laboratory results gave a fairly clear picture of growth after settlement. Growth rates followed a typical logistic curve, growth being slow initially and becoming more rapid later. The numbers of juveniles recruited to nursery areas vary from year to year but mortality following settlement appears to be low. It was found that juvenile S. australis predate M. insigne exclusively until they reach approximately 0.8cm in diameter (7-8 months old) when they may occasionally predate juvenile perna canaliculus. The incidence of carnivorous feeding gradually increases until juveniles are approximately 2.0-2.5cm in diameter (15-18 months old) by which time they are exclusively carnivorous on small P. canaliculus. As growth continues juvenile starfish gradually migrate from nursery areas to adjacent reefs where dense beds of adult P. canaliculus occur. Starfish of this species become sexually mature when they reach approximately 8.0cm in diameter. Juvenile C. calamaria reared in the laboratory feed on the primary film coating the substratum. Field observations at Leigh showed juveniles of 0.8-0.9cm diameter to be feeding on small barnacles on the undersides of boulders. Juveniles could not be reared to this size in the laboratory and the point at which juveniles change from a herbivorous or microphagous to a carnivorous diet is still unknown. Because of frequent autotomy it was not possible to determine growth rates of C. calamaria in the laboratory. Starfish of this species become sexually mature they reach 5.0-10.0cm in diameter.</field><field name="date">1977</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3332</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Damping and flexural properties of prestressed concrete members subjected to reversed cyclic loading</field><field name="creator">Spencer, Richard Anthony</field><field name="description">This thesis is divided into four parts.

Both main and changeover key performances were examined as a function of the relative reinforcement rates and of the changeover schedule duration. Main key performances changed quantitatively, but not qualitatively, as the temporal separation of components increased, with performance becoming less sensitive to relative reinforcement rates with increasing temporal separation. In general, absolute response rates were adequately predicated by the relative reinforcement rates, but in some conditions the absolute response rate was also affected by the availability of the responses. The rates of responding to change between components were controlled by the reinforcement rates in the both of the concurrent schedule components, and, in some conditions, varied independently of main key response rates. The rates of responding to alternate between components were a direct function of the reinforcement rate in the absent component, and were an inverse function of the reinforcement rate for main key responding in the same component. Animals alternated between the concurrent schedule components even when alternation reduced the overall rate of obtained reinforcement.</field><field name="date">1977</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3336</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Daz sint noch ungelogeniu wort: a literary and linguistic commentary on the Gurnemanz episode in Book iii of Wolfram&#8217;s Parzival (161,9-179,12)</field><field name="creator">Gilmour, Simon Julian</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420100 Language Studies::420109 German</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3335</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Patterns of stability and change orientations in organisational culture: a case study</field><field name="creator">Burchell, Richard Noel</field><field name="description">There is a fundamental need of all organisations to exhibit both stability and change behaviours in order to survive in the long term, particularly when operating in competitive environments. This duality may seem paradoxical and contradictory, but these interactions are necessary for sustainable organisational continuity. Stability and change should be considered in concert rather than focussing on change at the expense of stability. It is proposed that cultural manifestations can develop over time that directly or indirectly reflect organisational concerns with stability and change, and can be investigated as two key cultural dimensions. The aim of this study was to discover how and why organisational members associated their culture with the dimensions of stability and change. Interpretations of these associations provide support for the two dimensions being viewed as separate, but also being complementary and interdependent in nature. This differs from previous perspectives in the literature that portray the dimensions as being on a single dimension. This in-depth study was conducted in a single New Zealand business organisation. It shows how cultural orientations towards stability and change can be discerned as patterns. Associations by organisational members of cultural manifestations with the dimensions of stability and change was explored utilising a triangulation research design incorporating Concept Mapping and Pattern Matching, semi-structured interviews and observations as research methods. Pattern Matching is a technique that has not been previously employed in cultural research and the findings suggest the technique can be a useful tool in cultural analysis. The study showed that members found culture, and in particular its associations with stability and change, a somewhat challenging concept to articulate. This study also supports the need for the dimensions of stability and change to be viewed as being dynamic and interconnected. Nonetheless, a proposed typology was developed based on the premise that these dimensions are conceptually separate. It shows promise for better understanding the influence of culture on patterns of stability and change within organisations.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3347</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Rhythms, feeding and respiration of the oyster Crassostrea gigas</field><field name="creator">Goodwin, Elizabeth Elsa</field><field name="description">Endogeneity of valve movement rhythms was demonstrated for the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas under constant conditions of temperature, light, salinity, water level and food availability. Rhythms continued for up to 6 weeks until the experiments were terminated. The rhythms showed a high degree of temperature compensation between 13 - 24&#730;C, but at 4&#730;C the free-running period was abnormally long. The length of the &#8220;open", or active phase decreased with temperature. Oysters collected from subtidal sites, as opposed to intertidal sites, also exhibited endogenous rhythms when held under constant condition. Oysters that received no food during a starvation trial were also rhythmic. Oysters subjected to artificial tidal cycles (HL 6:6h), show very precise synchronization of valve opening and closing to the cycles. Oysters were also be entrained to water disturbance cycles (6:6h) and light cycles (LD 12:12h), but the synchronization was not as precise. Rhythms were characterized by (1) split rhythms (2) spontaneous changes in the free-running period (3) spontaneous changes in rhythm clarity (4) spontaneous phase changes (5) and a Lot of "noise". These characteristics suggest that the underlying pacemaker controlling the rhythm may consist of more than one oscillator or more than one group of oscillators. No conclusive evidence could be found for semilunar or lunar rhythmicity. Cycles in the rate of algal cell clearance over a 24h period were shown by individual oysters. As a consequence of the variability between individuals combining the data tended to hide the existence of the rhythms. No evidence for rhythms in assimilation efficiency was found. Cell clearance rates were also affected by rising temperature over the range 4 - 25&#730;C, reaching a peak value at 17&#730;C. The rate of cell clearance fell sharply after 60 - 90min of feeding in a closed system, indicating that the rate was significantly affected by the decline in food availability. The time taken to open the valves and to start faeces production fell with increasing temperature. The amount of faeces production followed a similar trend. Assimilation efficiency fell with increasing temperature and many negative values were evident, suggesting contamination. However the total weight of faeces produced was less than that of food available implying that the oysters were assimilating inorganic material. The time taken to open the valves and the % oysters that opened their valves was adversely affected by declining salinity over the range 8.5 - 34&#8240;. The time taken to start faeces production and. the % of oysters that produced faeces followed a similar trend. Assimilation efficiency was not significantly different at 25.5 and 34&#8240;. AE% could not be measured at 8.5 and 17&#8240; due to a lack of normal faeces. Individual oysters showed cycles in the rate of oxygen uptake, but these were not synchronized to the tides or to each other. Pooling the data to calculate means cancelled out the individual rhythmicities. The presence or absence of food did not affect the expression of the cycle. The rate of oxygen uptake was positively correlated to oyster dry weight, temperature and salinity. Though for salinity the rate of oxygen uptake fell sharply below a critical salinity occurring between 10 - 13&#8240;. Oysters held in sealed respirometers maintained a constant rate of oxygen uptake until a critical level of oxygen availability was reached, the rate of oxygen uptake dropped .significantly below this level. The slope of the regression lines (&#730;b&#730;), prior to reaching the critical oxygen level, increased with temperature, salinity and food concentration. But the time taken to reach the critical oxygen level, and the level of oxygen availability at which this occurred, was not significantly correlated with temperature, salinity or food concentration. The pattern of valve movement corresponded to the level of oxygen available. Valve movements became very frequent as the critical oxygen level was approached. Activity was reduced to occasional periods of valve movement after it was reached. The level of activity was adversely affected by declining salinity, but was not affected by the level of food availability.</field><field name="date">1989</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270500 Zoology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3338</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Rarotongan society: the creation of tradition</field><field name="creator">Baddeley, Josephine Gail</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">1978</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370300 Anthropology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3339</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Aspects of urban form: a descriptive technique and investigation of the form of a New Zealand urban environment</field><field name="creator">Civil, Denise</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates factors which influence the physical form of the urban environment at the micro-scale. Three aspects of form are considered. These are configuration, separation, and consistency. A method of assessing the form of a property from a public place with respect to these aspects is outlined. The technique breaks each aspect into a scale of form types as a tool for measuring the formal characteristics of the environment. These form types are used to describe an urban environment. A comparison of this description with the physical attributes of the area identifies four factors which may have affected the patterns and distributions of the forms observed in the description. These are land use, land ownership patterns, time, and regulatory controls. Detailed studies of these factors in five particular areas reveals that relationships between each of the factors and the incidence of the various form types exist. Correspondences which suggest that the factor probably has an influence on the forms identified are evident in varying degrees depending on the factor considered.</field><field name="date">1984</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::310000 Architecture, Urban Environment and Building::310100 Architecture and Urban Environment::310103 Urban and regional planning</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3346</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The sin-complex: a critical study of English versions of the Grimms&#8217; Kinder- und Hausm&#228;rchen in the nineteenth century in comparison with the German originals</field><field name="creator">Sutton, Martin James</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates the English versions of the Grimms&#8217; Kinder- und Hausm&#228;rchen (= KHM) published between the years 1823 and 1884, i.e. from the first translation by Edgar Taylor and David Jardine, German Popular Stories (1823 and 1826), to the first complete edition of the Grimms&#8217; collection of stories and notes by Margaret Hunt, Grimm&#8217;s Household Tales (1884). Each of the first eleven chapters deals with a specific English edition and gives an analysis of one or more stories from that edition together with the texts of the German original. The two versions, German and English, are placed alongside each other in parallel columns to facilitate comparison. The twelfth chapter takes the final paragraph of one story, &#8216;Sneewittchen&#8217; (KHM 53), and examines the seven different English versions of it in the editions discussed in the previous chapters. The final chapter compares the quality of English translations of the KHM in the nineteenth century with that of the Grimms&#8217; sole venture in translating tales in the English language into German, viz. Wilhelm Grimm&#8217;s Irische Elfenm&#228;rchen (1826). Included as an appendix is a tabulated concordance of the contents of the twelve major editions discussed in this thesis. The investigation shows that the areas deemed to be sensitive ones by English translators were those which had to do with what Darton (Children&#8217;s Books in England, 1982, p.99) has singled out as &#8216;a deep-rooted sin-complex&#8217; in England. Any story that touched on the issues of religious belief and superstition, the human body and its physical nature, violence and evil, and the intense emotions felt by human beings which prompt them to commit violent and destructive acts, was inevitably viewed with concern and mistrust, especially by purveyors of children&#8217;s literature in the nineteenth century. All these issues, as well as the element of fantasy which so readily admits and entertains them, were prone to considerable revision by successive translators of the KHM.</field><field name="date">1994</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420100 Language Studies::420109 German</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3348</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Effects of beta-adrenergic antagonists in patients with heart failure</field><field name="creator">Doughty, Robert N.</field><field name="description">Background Congestive heart failure is a common clinical syndrome, the incidence and prevalence of which appear to be increasing. Mortality and morbidity remain high despite major advances in the understanding of the pathophysiology and management of heart failure over recent years. Consequently there is a need for further therapies which can improve the outlook for patients with heart failure. The beta-blockers have traditionally been contraindicated in patients with heart failure. However, there is a strong rationale for using these agents in addition to the ACE inhibitors. The aims of this thesis were several fold. Firstly, to determine the magnitude of the problem which heart failure represents in New Zealand. Secondly, to determine the effects of beta-blockers, on LV size and function, symptoms, and exercise tolerance in patients with heart failure due to ischaemic heart disease. Finally, to conduct a systematic overview to determine the effects of beta-blockers on total mortality in patients with heart failure. Methods Data were obtained from the New Zealand Health Information Service regarding hospitalisations and deaths due to heart failure in New Zealand. A randomised, placebo-controlled trial of the effects of carvedilol, a vasodilator beta-blocker, was carried out in 20 hospitals in Australia and New Zealand. In this study patients with heart failure due to ischaemic heart disease were randomised to either carvedilol or placebo in addition to their usual treatment. An echocardiographic substudy was carried out in 10 of the 20 centres. The aims of this substudy were to determine the effects of carvedilol on left ventricular size and function, using quantitative 2D-echocardiography. Finally, the effects of beta-blockers on total mortality was examined in a systematic overview. Results The data regarding heart failure in New Zealand showed that each year there were an average of 8000 hospital admissions each year of 5000 patients with heart failure. In addition, there were at least 850 deaths each year directly related to heart failure. The cost associated with the hospital admissions was estimated at NZ$50 million per year, or 1% of the total health budget in New Zealand. The ANZ carvedilol study demonstrated firstly, that carvedilol is well tolerated in patients with heart failure due to ischaemic heart disease. Left ventricular ejection fraction improved compared with placebo treated patients and left ventricular size was reduced when assessed by M-mode echocardiography. Despite these improvements in left ventricular function, symptoms and exercise tolerance were unchanged. However, there was a reduction in a combined end-point of death or hospital readmission in the carvedilol group compared with placebo. The 2D-echocardigraphy substudy demonstrated that carvedilol reduced both end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes and prevented the progressive LV dilatation which occurred in the placebo group. These changes occurred with the improvement in LV ejection fraction which had previously been reported. In addition to these favourable effects on LV size and function, left ventricular regional wall motion was improved. The overview of 24 randomised trials involving 3141 patients showed that beta-blocker therapy reduced total mortality by 31% compared with control. Conclusions Firstly, the NZ data has confirmed that heart failure remains a major public health problem in New Zealand. The ANZ Carvedilol Trial has shown the carvedilol is safe and well tolerated in patients with heart failure due to ischaemic heart disease. Carvedilol improved left ventricular ejection fraction, reduced left ventricular volumes and improved left ventricular regional wall motion. In addition, carvedilol reduced death or hospital readmission but had little effect on symptoms or exercise tolerance. The results from the meta-analysis have shown that beta-blocker therapy reduced total mortality by approximately one-third. Such data support the use of beta-blockers in addition to ACE inhibitors in the treatment of patients with heart failure. However, further randomised, controlled trials are required to reliably determine the effects of beta-blockers in different patient subgroups, such as the elderly and those with more severe heart failure, as well as the effects on total mortality before such therapy can be recommended for widespread use in all patients with heart failure.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3349</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Epidemiological studies of leg ulcers in Auckland, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Walker, Natalie K.</field><field name="description">A leg ulcer is generally considered to be any break in the skin on the lower leg (below the knee) or on the foot, which has been present for more than six weeks. Typically the condition is a consequence of disease of the circulatory system, and can cause considerable disability. The Auckland leg ulcer study is a community-based study of leg ulceration conducted in the North Auckland and Central Auckland health districts of New Zealand. The study aimed to determine the prevalence and incidence of leg ulcers in the community and investigate several possible risk factors for the condition. Cases were identified through notifications from health professionals and by self-notification. Cases aged between 40 and 99 years and on the electoral roll for the study region were invited to participate in a case-control study. Controls were individuals without leg ulcers and were selected from the electoral roll using a stratified random sampling process. Controls were also aged between 40 and 99 years and had to be resident within the study region to be eligible. Four hundred and twenty-six cases with current leg ulcers were identified during the 12-month study period, with 241 cases and 224 controls interviewed for the case-control study. Overall, the occurrence of leg ulcers in the general population was low, however, the prevalence and cumulative incidence increased dramatically with age, and changed according to gender and region. The average age at ulcer onset in interviewed cases was 65 years. Leg ulcers took approximately 12 months on average to heal, and recurrence occurred in 59% of cases. Treatment strategies were variable, and almost a quarter of all cases had been admitted to hospital within the last five years because of their ulcers. The average length of hospital stay was 34 days. Results from the case-control study indicated that deep vein thrombosis, lower limb surgery, leg fracture, and varicose veins were strong risk factors for the development of leg ulcers, Furthermore, nulligravida increased the risk of ulcer development while prolonged breast-feeding decreased risk, suggesting a hormonal component to the development of leg ulcers in women. These data have important implications for the prevention of this chronic condition.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3351</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Mechanism of the anti-tumour action of flavone acetic acid and its xanthenone acetic acid analogues</field><field name="creator">Zwi, Leon Jonathan</field><field name="description">The search for new compounds with anti-tumour activity is driven by the high mortality from disseminated visceral carcinomas for which few effective treatments exist. The experimental agent flavone acetic acid (FAA) has stimulated interest because of its broad spectrum of activity against solid tumours in mice. This remarkable activity spectrum suggested an unusual mechanism of action. The aim of the thesis was to elucidate the mechanism of action of FAA and its analogues in mouse tumours, particularly the rapid induction of haemorrhagic necrosis Light and electron microscopic studies of Colon 38 tumours treated with 1.2 mmo1/kg FAA revealed a sequence of tumour cell separation and rounding focal apoptosis and finally confluent necrosis with blood vessel engorgement and rupture within 4 - 8 h. This was accompanied by a loss of energy metabolites. The combination of apoptotic and necrotic modes of cell death suggested that both ischaemic and non-ischaemic mechanisms were involved. The role of blood flow failure was further investigated in Colon 38 and EMT6 tumours using a double label fluorescent vessel-labelling technique, which demonstrated a progressive and sustained fall in blood flow, beginning within 15 min of treatment. A mathematical model of ischaemic tumour cell killing using data from measurements of tumour perfusion, the rate of FAA-induced cell killing and the rate of cell death following global ischaemia indicated that mechanisms in addition ischaemia were involved. However, comparison of the resistance to FAA of avascular intraperitoneal tumour multicellular spheroids and vascularised tumours suggested that the major component of the anti-tumour effect was indeed blood vessel-dependent. The vessel-independent effects of FAA were then studied in vitro, using EMT6 tumour multicellular spheroids which had been placed for six days in the peritoneal cavities of mice to become infiltrated by macrophages and lymphocytes. These ex vivo spheroids were more that twice as sensitive as spheroids grown entirely in vitro, when exposed to 2.5 mM FAA for 24 h. This provides evidence for immune cell mediation of the FAA anti-tumour effect. To determine the relative importance of the vessel dependent and the immune mediated effects of FAA, a novel vascularised spheroid tumour system, which contained both avascular and vascular component was developed and studied. FAA treatment caused necrosis only in the vascularised component preceded by a loss in perfusion. The avascular tumour tissue also showed evidence of some cell loss by apoptosis. Thus, in tumour tissue not relying directly on blood vessels for metabolite exchange only limited cell killing occurs suggesting that treatment with FAA-like agents alone would have limited ability to cure. The anti-tumour activities of a series of xanthenone acetic acid (XAA) analogues of FAA, were then compared with FAA by examination and measurement of morphological changes in subcutaneous tumours and spheroids, and by measurement of blood perfusion In tumours. Those XAA analogues which were active in inducing haemorrhagic necrosis also caused FAA-like morphological changes in tumours and spheroids and inhibited blood flow, indicating a similar mode of action to FAA. The parent XAA and FAA were approximately equipotent, and 5-methyl XAA and 5,6-dimethyl XAA were about ten times as potent as FAA. 3-O-methyl XAA, 8-methyl XAA and xanthenone-4,5-diacetic acid showed no FAA-like activities. Examination of non-tumour tissues after therapeutic doses of FAA and 5,6-dimethyl XAA showed cytolytic lesions Including necrosis In the peripheral lymphoid tissues, the thymus and the uterus. Thus, although these agents lack the myelosuppressive effects of conventional chemotherapeutic agents cell killing is not entirely specific for tumours. The sensitive tissues, including tumours, have in common a high content of macrophages or neutrophils, and regions of low vascular density. The thesis studies have shown that FAA and its analogues differ from conventional cytotoxic (anti-proliferative) agents in their mechanism of action. Direct toxicity against tumour cells is of minor importance compared to macrophage mediated cytotoxicity and perfusion failure. If biological activity can be demonstrated in humans FAA-like agents may show clinical utility in combination with radiotherapy, conventional or hypoxia selective cytotoxic agents.</field><field name="date">1992</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3356</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Status epilepticus: mechanisms of generation and associated neuropathology</field><field name="creator">Young, Deborah</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3354</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The chronotope as a model for hypermedia in architectural education</field><field name="creator">Soutar, Anna L., 1942-</field><field name="description">The thesis is a retrospective reporting and a critical examination of HyperSteel. This is a hypermedia application for architectural education intended to function as a learning bridge between structural knowledge-acquisition and intuitive use. It is one of many parallel developments in software design that have occurred around the world in the last decade (Mitchell 1995). Hypermedia is a set of procedures applied to computer aided learning that is based upon interactive software, typically Apple Computer's Hypercard&#169;, and its successors. How can this medium with its strongly cinematographic characteristics best be used in the imaginative and intuitive processes of an architectural education? The term cinema - whether it means the discipline and industry of film making or whether it is the architecture of a place of entertainment - evokes diverse concepts and images. These include illusions of time and space, the sense of seeing more than one reality at the same time; and of existing at the intersection of art and technology. This thesis argues that these related concepts and images can be distilled from cinema and other established disciplines, and adapted into a common aesthetic for hypermedia. The thesis posits a chronotopic theory with respect to the computer-human interface, whose integral imaginative mechanism is the click-jump of the user interface device. Mikhail Bakhtin's chronotopic event is borrowed from literary theory to describe the progression and development of time and space as they intersect (Bakhtin 1937). It is argued that this moment of the man-machine coordinated action is the act which puts imaginative control of the learning process into the hands of the learner and thus becomes the central vehicle of knowledge delivery. The theoretical underpinning for this argument refers to depictions of architecture as a space-time experience used by historian Sigfried Giedion (1941).

This is a hypermedia application for architectural education intended to function as a learning bridge between structural knowledge-acquisition and intuitive use. It is one of many parallel developments in software design that have occurred around the world in the last decade (Mitchell 1991). Hypermedia is a set of procedures applied to computer aided learning that is based upon interactive software, typically Apple Computer's Hypercard&#169;, and its successors. How can this medium with its strongly cinematographic characteristics best be used in the imaginative and intuitive processes of an architectural education? The term cinema - whether it means the discipline and industry of film making or whether it is the architecture of a place of entertainment - evokes diverse concepts and images. These include illusions of time and space, the sense of seeing more than one reality at the same time; and of existing at the intersection of art and technology. This thesis argues that these related concepts and images can be distilled from cinema and other established disciplines, and adapted into a common aesthetic for hypermedia. The thesis posits a chronotopic theory with respect to the computer-human interface, whose integral imaginative mechanism is the click-jump of the user interface device. Mikhail Bakhtin's chronotopic event is borrowed from literary theory to describe the progression and development of time and space as they intersect (Bakhtin 1937). It is argued that this moment of the man-machine coordinated action is the act which puts imaginative control of the learning process into the hands of the learner and thus becomes the central vehicle of knowledge delivery. The theoretical underpinning for this argument refers to depictions of architecture as a space-time experience used by historian Sigfried Giedion (1941). The perception of the intuition as tacit knowledge is developed from Michael Polanyi (1969), and the conclusions of cognitive psychologist Allan Paivio and others provide an educational principle of dual processing as a model for learning by hypermedia (Paivio 1986).The writings of Paul Ricoeur (1988) on the nature of a meaning for narrative which encompasses both time and space along one horizon in which the traveller - in this case the student architect - arrives at perceptive understanding in their learning process, will also inform this theoretical perspective. The intention of the thesis is- to identify, and theorise digital chronotopicity as it functions in architecture education. My conclusion is that there is a role for the media practitioner and theorist in making interactive software tools effective in the context of computer technologies and architecture education.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::310000 Architecture, Urban Environment and Building</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3353</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Long-term effects on antenatal glucocorticoids and preterm birth</field><field name="creator">Dalziel, Stuart Ryan</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3355</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The meaning of the built environment: dwelling environments as meaning household identity</field><field name="creator">Niculescu, Susan Katharine</field><field name="description">The thesis is an attempt to find whether there is any perceived or actual correlation between people (personal characteristics, or characteristics of subgroups) and the environments they choose--in particular, their houses; that is, to correlate identifiable physical aspects of environment with various identifiable personal or social characteristics, and to attempt to explain why such correlations occur; thence to postulate theories which will enable environments to be designed to be acceptable to particular groups of people. "The thesis", part 1 of the thesis, is a theoretical statement comprising, in Chapter I, an explicit statement of the theoretical framework in the form of five premises derived from philosophy and theories of psychology, art and architecture, and sociology. And, in Chapter II, a statement of the two hypotheses (that dwelling environments are perceived as "meaning" the people who live in them and that people choose dwelling environments, other things being equal, according to their concept of the kind of people they are) and the assumptions necessary to test them. In Part 2: "The Research Method" Chapter III covers the development of the measure of closure in dwelling environments. Closure was chosen in Chapter II as the environmental variable to be used for the purposes of this study. The final measure comprises five sets of four bird&#8217;s eye view perspective line drawings depicting five situations in a typical house in which closure is varied in four steps from very open to very closed. Chapter IV describes the development of the measure of household identity. The measure of household identity was developed especially to be of relevance to the choice of degrees of closure in dwelling environments. The measure is derived from actual verbal responses of the respondents to open ended questions asked in pilot studies. In Chapter V, the last chapter in Part 2, the research design of the survey study is described: the research model used, the design of the questionnaire, and the sampling method. The first chapter of Part 3: "The Results and Discussion of the Results", Chapter VI, presents the sample size (610) and shows that the sample is representative of the population of the Auckland greater urban area. In Chapter VII, the results relating to hypothesis I are presented and discussed. The results weakly support the hypothesis but the correlations are not of sufficient strength to be used predictively. In Chapter VIII the results of hypothesis 2 are presented and discussed. These results also support the hypothesis but even less strongly so than for hypothesis 1. Chapter VIII also covers sub-hypothesis 1, that people choose dwelling environments according to their "objective&#8221; household identity, In Chapter IX the results of the hypotheses are compared and summarized. And in Chapter X the implications of the results are outlined: an attempt is made to relative the results to the theoretical framework and from this implications for a possible theory of aesthetics are drawn. The implications of the results for the theory and practice of architecture are delineated and finally suggestions for future research are outlined.</field><field name="date">1975</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::310000 Architecture, Urban Environment and Building</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3358</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The complaints and disciplinary process in New Zealand and the effect of complaints on doctors</field><field name="creator">Cunningham, Wayne Kenneth</field><field name="description">New Zealand society assumes that the medical complaints process enhances the delivery of medical care, although the literature suggests that complaints may impact negatively on doctors, and their ability to practice. This thesis examines the impact of the complaints process on doctors in New Zealand. It considers the practice of medicine from the viewpoints of the epistemology of medicine; the doctor-patient relationship; and the notion of professionalism. It presents the results of research methods investigating New Zealand doctors using focus groups; a cross sectional questionnaire based survey; and in-depth semi-structured interviews. Findings include: One in three doctors has received a complaint. The annual rate of complaint is 5.70%, 15% of complaints are upheld. Complaints impact negatively on the person of the doctor, the doctor-patient relationship, and doctors&#8217; ability to practice. The purposes of a complaints system include: the maintenance of trust and professional standards; being a voice for patients; and learning from mistakes and errors. Doctors&#8217; attitudes are consistent with notions of professionalism. Defensive medicine is an adverse outcome of the complaints process. Doctors suggest a Complaints Tribunal as a single point of entry into the complaints process. The current complaints process is not improving the delivery of medical care to New Zealand society. New Zealand doctors are aware of both the biomedical and bio-psychosocial paradigms underlying modern medicine, and the results confirm the importance of the self of the doctor and the doctor-patient relationship in medical practice. The emergence of defensive medicine indicates that doctors may respond to complaints by practicing in a way that is not in their patients&#8217; best interests, but which serves to protect doctors themselves. Defensive medicine risks being unrecognised and becoming normalised into mainstream medical practice. The negative impact of complaints on doctors&#8217; values and beliefs indicate an erosion of values based professionalism. This thesis suggests that an appropriate model for considering medical professionalism is as a state of relationship between doctors and society. Appropriate change to the complaints process may enhance the doctor-society relationship and ultimately enhance the delivery of medical care in New Zealand.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3357</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The morality of planning: an exploration</field><field name="creator">Ferguson, Gael, 1959-</field><field name="description">This thesis explores the contention that planning is a moral activity concerned with the way in which people live in relation to nature or the environment. It suggests that planning is the moral framework by which communities and individuals confront their relationship with nature or the environment. It argues that certain disciplines such as town planning, resource management, environmental ethics, aspects of theology and of art are but isolated and narrowed aspects of a wider activity of planning. The rationale for embarking on such a discussion of planning relies in part on the observation that when modern planners take a more contemplative approach to their craft, they have often been perplexed about their frequent failure to deliver the good they assumed that planning set out to achieve. It is suggested that this intent to achieve good is inherent to planning and that it is a moral concern. Planning, under this analysis, is part of the wider realm of moral philosophy and decision-making - that is undertaken by all people. Planning extends beyond mere moral discourse to encompass a number of mechanisms that bind individuals and communities to the moral norms they have adopted. These mechanisms, one of which is the key institution of property rights, are also affected by ideas that change over time; they exist in a dynamic interrelationship with both planning discourse (debates about moral structures and norms) and planning codes (norms adopted by individuals and communities as standards for action). This thesis takes this broad interpretation of planning and considers it in relation to four periods in planning history. In doing so, a number of themes are identified in relation to the role of planners, the decision-making structures of planning and the nature of planning discourse. These themes are considered in relation to the way Maori planning systems have developed in New Zealand since European settlement. They are also considered in terms of whether it is possible to identify certain universal moral rules within planning and whether there are certain tasks that all planners must address.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::310000 Architecture, Urban Environment and Building</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3359</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Blood pressure, cholesterol and cardiovascular diseases in eastern Asia</field><field name="creator">Rodgers, Anthony</field><field name="description">Background Considerable uncertainty exists about the strength and shape of associations of blood pressure and cholesterol with the risks of stroke, coronary heart disease and total cardiovascular death in eastern Asian populations. Therefore, uncertainty also exists about the size of the likely effects on cardiovascular mortality and morbidity of prolonged exposure changes in these populations. The Eastern Stroke and Coronary Heart Disease Collaborative Project was initiated to determine the associations of usual diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and usual cholesterol with the risks of stroke, coronary heart disease (CHD) and total cardiovascular death in cohort studies from eastern Asia. Methods A collaborative overview of cohort studies included data from 13 cohorts from the People&#8217;s Republic of China (PRC) and five cohorts from Japan, involving a total of 124,774 participants among whom 837,214 person-years were observed. The overall mean age of participants was 47 years, 43% were current smokers and 39% were female. Both parametric and non-parametric analyses were performed, with adjustments made for several potential confounding factors. Efforts were made to correct for the bias introduced by estimation of "usual" DBP and cholesterol from measurements made at baseline (the "regression dilution" bias). The resulting estimates of associations of blood pressure and cholesterol with cardiovascular diseases were combined with data from surveys of blood pressure and cholesterol levels in Asian and other populations, estimates of the incidence of cardiovascular disease, and results from randomised trials of blood pressure and cholesterol lowering treatments to estimate the possible effects of blood pressure and cholesterol lowering. Findings The overall mean DBP at baseline was 78 mmHg. A total of 1,798 strokes were observed, of which about 45% were confirmed by computed tomography (CT) or autopsy. Each 5 mmHg lower usual DBP was associated with about two-fifths lower non-haemorrhagic stroke risk and about one-half lower haemorrhagic stroke risk(-5 mmHg: odds ratio 0.56, 95% Cl: 0.53-0.59 and 0.69, 0.65-0.73, respectively). The risks were continuous throughout the range of DBP studied (baseline DBP 70-114 mmHg, usual DBP 76-97 mmHg). Each 5 mmHg lower usual DBP was associated with almost a halving of total stroke risk (-5 mmHg: 0.56, 0.53-0.59). The risk of CHD was also strongly and positively related to usual DBP (-5 mmHg: 0.73, 0.66-0.80). Since about half of all cardiovascular deaths were due to stroke, they were strongly related to blood pressure with, on average, each 5 mmHg lower usual DBP associated with about one-third fewer such deaths (-5 mmHg: 0.69, 0.65-0.73). The mean cholesterol at baseline was 4.5 mmol/l (174 mg/dl) and disease risks were assessed across a range of cholesterol levels that correspond approximately to the lower two thirds of the distribution in most Western populations (baseline cholesterol 3.4-6.7mmol/l and estimated usual cholesterol 4.15.8mmol/l). There was a trend toward a negative association of usual cholesterol with strokes classified as haemorrhagic (0.6 mmol/l lower usual cholesterol associated with odds ratio of 1.27, 95% confidence limits 0.84-1.91) and a trend toward a positive association with strokes classified as non-haemorrhagic (-0.6 mmol/l: 0.77, 0.57-1.06). The consequence of these two apparently different (P=0.06) associations, was a weak positive association of usual cholesterol with total stroke (-0.6 mmol/l: O.92, 0.72-1.17). in contrast, there was clear evidence of strong positive associations of usual cholesterol with the risks of CHD (_0.6 mmol/l: 0.47,0.31, 0.71) and of total cardiovascular death (_0.6 mmol/l: 0.58, 0.44-0.76).Overall, there was no clear indication of an interaction between the effects of cholesterol and DBP, when assessed on a multiplicative scale. The estimates of the potential effects of blood pressure lowering indicated that a 3 mmHg lower usual DBP should eventually result in about one-third fewer strokes and one-sixth fewer CHD events. If accompanied by a 0.3 mmol/l lower usual cholesterol, then eventually one-third fewer stroke and CHD events should occur. In the PRC alone, such reductions would be expected to avert over half a million deaths annually. Most events would be prevented in those without hypertension or hypercholesterolaemia. World-wide, a 2% reduction in cholesterol levels would avert about 0'5 million (4%) of CHD deaths in 2020. A 2% reduction in DBP would avert an estimated 1.2 million (16%) stroke deaths and 0.6 million (6%) CHD deaths in 2020. Interpretation Blood pressure is a profoundly important determinant of cardiovascular disease in eastern Asian populations. The relationship observed here between blood pressure and total cardiovascular deaths is steeper than that typically observed in Western populations. This difference appears to be largely due to the different composition of cardiovascular deaths in Eastern populations, with a larger proportion of deaths due to conditions that are strongly related to blood pressure, such as haemorrhagic stroke. In these populations with comparatively low cholesterol from eastern Asia, there was no clear evidence of a cholesterol level below which risks of CHD or total cardiovascular death did not continue to decrease. The strength of the association of cholesterol with CHD was similar to that observed in other populations. The results suggest that modest population-wide reductions in these exposures, particularly blood pressure, could avert a large proportion of the substantial and increasing burden of cardiovascular disease in eastern Asian and other populations.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3361</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Induced myopia in the guinea pig: scleral myofibroblasts and biomechanics</field><field name="creator">Backhouse, Simon</field><field name="description">Aims: To determine the effect of induced myopia on the in vivo scleral biomechanical properties and scleral cell populations in the guinea pig. Methods: One week old guinea pigs were monocularly deprived of form vision (MD) for 14 days. Cycloplegic refractive error was measured with an IR Optometer, and the results analysed using power vectors and linear mixed modelling. The in vivo ocular biomechanical response was investigated by raising the IOP to 50 mmHg for one hour in anaesthetised animals. A-scan ultrasound measures of axial length were taken every 10 minutes with raised IOP, and after returning IOP to 15 mmHg. The total cell population (DAPI antibody) and myofibroblast population (&#945;-SMA antibody) was determined in transverse scleral sections from the posterior 100 degrees of each eye. Results: The average relative myopic refractive error induced was -4.06 &#177; 0.35 D, which was mainly the result of vitreous chamber depth (VCD) elongation. This was confirmed by a negative correlation between mean sphere and VCD (R2 = 0.4295). On increasing the IOP the deprived and control eyes showed rapid viscoelastic expansion of the VCD that normal eyes did not show. When the increased IOP was maintained the deprived and control eyes showed lower creep rates than normal eyes. Myofibroblasts were shown to be present in guinea pig sclera, as previously observed in human and tree shrew sclera. On average, approximately 64% of the scleral cells were myofibroblasts. The induction of myopia had minimal effect on the cell populations, except for a decrease in total cell numbers in the 10&#176; region equivalent to the location of scleral crescent formation in myopic human eyes. Conclusions: Ahigh proportion of scleral cells show contractile potential in the guinea pig. Form deprivation appears to minimally affect cell numbers, except in the region equivalent to scleral crescent formation in myopic human eyes. However, the in vivo viscoelastic response of the VCD in deprived eyes differs from that in normal eyes, suggesting some factor(s) other than cell number alone has a role in axial length control.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3377</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of Rotenone and 6-OHDA on Dopaminergic Neurons of the Substantia Nigra Studied In Vitro</field><field name="creator">Freestone, Peter Stuart</field><field name="description">This study investigated the neurotoxic effects of rotenone and 6-hyroxydopamine (6 OHDA), two compounds which have been implicated in Parkinson&#8217;s disease (PD). PD is a neurodegenerative disorder that results in the impairment of movement. During the disease process, a group of dopamine-containing cells in the brain region called the Substantia Nigra pars compacta (SNc), degenerate. Whilst genetic factors contribute to approximately 5% of PD cases, the causes of the remaining 95% are unknown. What does seem clear is the pivotal role of mitochondrial dysfunction as observed in post-mortem human tissue. Mitochondrial dysfunction leads to energy depletion and the generation of harmful reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, despite the fact that the involvement of mitochondria in the disease process has been well established, the cellular events that lead to, and result from, mitochondrial dysfunction remain poorly understood. Rotenone and 6 OHDA have been implicated in PD for two reasons: (1) both toxins can relatively selectively kill SNc neurons in animal models of PD, and (2) there is evidence for both compounds having a potential causative role in the etiology of the disease in humans. When 6 OHDA is injected into the brain, or rotenone applied systemically, both toxins cause degeneration of SNc neurons. This ability makes them excellent tools for studying mechanisms of PD in animal models. In addition, both toxins inhibit mitochondrial function. Despite extensive use in models of PD, the mechanisms by which each toxin cause cell damage remains elusive. The first part of this study investigated the acute responses of dopaminergic SNc neurons to rotenone exposure (5 nM &#8211; 1 &#181;M). The experiments were conducted on brain slices obtained from rats. Electrophysiological recordings (whole-cell patch-clamp technique) were used to detect activation of specific membrane channels as well as cell firing and changes to the membrane potential. In addition, imaging of several fluorescent dyes sensitive to specific cellular events was carried out. In voltage-clamp experiments, acute rotenone (200 nM &#8211; 1 &#181;M) application evoked a concentration-dependent outward current which was mediated by tolbutamide-sensitive KATP channels. The current was associated with a drop in cell input resistance (Rm) and, in current-clamp, membrane hyperpolarization and inhibition of spontaneous action potentials. The mechanisms by which rotenone activates KATP channels is controversial, with some studies suggesting activation by ATP depletion and others by elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS). To address this issue, experiments were conducted with high levels of ATP in the pipette solution. Since the rotenone-induced outward current was unaffected by high ATP levels, it was concluded that KATP channel activation was due to oxidative stress. Indeed, the antioxidant Trolox significantly attenuated the current response. Confirmation of elevated ROS production was obtained by recording increased mitochondrial superoxide production, using the fluorescent dye MitoSOX. In addition, rotenone evoked depolarization of mitochondrial membrane potential (&#916;&#936;m). Measurements of intracellular Ca2+ and Na+ were performed using the fluorescent dyes Fura 2 and SBFI, respectively. Rotenone evoked increases to both [Ca2+]i and [Na+]i in a concentration-dependent manner. The rotenone-induced [Ca2+]i rise was unaffected by blocking KATP channels with Cs+. The elevation of [Ca2+]i is particularly important in relation to cell death, since [Ca2+]i overload is known to activate pathways leading to necrosis and apoptosis. There has been growing interest in the synergistic action of rotenone with other toxins/conditions which also enhance [Ca2+]i. This concept was explored in the present study by testing the relationship between the baseline [Ca2+]i level and the rotenone-induced [Ca2+]i increase. Two approaches were taken. Firstly, baseline [Ca2+]i was deliberately raised by activation of voltage-gated calcium channels. When rotenone was applied in the presence of this raised baseline calcium level, the rotenone-induced [Ca2+]i rise was significantly greater. The second approach involved post-hoc analysis of the relationship between the normal cellular variation in baseline [Ca2+]i and the rotenone-induced [Ca2+]i elevation. This analysis also revealed a dependency of the rotenone-induced [Ca2+]i elevation on the baseline calcium level. From this finding, as well as the observation that rotenone evoked ROS production, Transient Receptor Protein subtype M2 (TRPM2) channels were proposed as the likely underlying mechanism. The potentiation of the rotenone-induced [Ca2+]i rise by an elevation in baseline calcium level can be attributed to the calcium-dependence of ROS-sensitive TRPM2 channels, known to respond with increased channel opening to increased [Ca2+]i. Recent findings from our laboratory have confirmed TRPM2 involvement in rotenone toxicity, since blockade of these channels with ACA reduced the rotenone-induced [Ca2+]i rise (K. Chung, unpublished). Imaging using the fluorescent dye propidium iodide (PI) to label cells with compromised membrane integrity was also conducted in acute midbrain slices. SNc neurons were retrograde-labelled with FluoroGold and then exposed to various toxic insults. The detergent Triton-X100 caused an increase in PI labelling, whilst rotenone and high concentrations of glutamate were ineffective over the period of time investigated (up to 40 min). The second part of this study, also conducted on acute rat midbrain slices, investigated the acute responses of SNc neurons to 6 OHDA (0.2 &#8211; 2 mM) exposure. Extracellular recordings of action potential firing were conducted on SNc neurons. 6 OHDA evoked rapid inhibition of firing in a similar manner to dopamine (100 &#181;M). In the presence of D2 dopamine receptor blocker sulpiride, the inhibition of firing evoked by 6 OHDA was delayed, and an initial increase of firing was observed. Blockade of the dopamine transporter with nomifensine reduced the 6 OHDA-induced inhibition of firing, and prevented the persistent inhibition of firing after 6 OHDA washout. For comparison, the response to 6 OHDA of non-dopaminergic neurons in the subthalamic nucleus was also studied. In the subthalamic nucleus, 6 OHDA evoked an increase of spontaneous action potential firing. Rapid application of 6 OHDA (using the picospritz application technique) in voltage-clamp recorded SNc neurons evoked an outward current, similar to that observed after dopamine application. In the presence of sulpiride, 6 OHDA induced an inward current, consistent with the initial increase of firing activity observed in extracellular recordings. Microfluorometric experiments with Fura 2, showed that 6 OHDA evokes an increase in [Ca2+]i. Loading cells with the fluorescent dye Lucifer Yellow enabled visualization of 6 OHDA-induced swelling of the cell body and damage to proximal dendrites. Imaging of SNc neurons loaded with dextran-rhodamine revealed 6 OHDA-induced damage of distal dendrites. The last part of the study was performed on organotypic cultures obtained from slices of the ventral midbrain. These cultures were prepared from newborn transgenic mice expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) under the tyrosine hydroxylase-promoter. This fluorescent marker enabled easy identification of dopamine-containing cells (including SNc neurons). Only preliminary experiments were carried out using this preparation. GFP-positive neurons did not show the classic membrane hyperpolarization in response to dopamine. For comparison, recordings from GFP-positive SNc neurons in acute slices obtained from age-matched animals did show a typical hyperpolarizing response to dopamine. GFP-neurons from organotypic cultures also lacked the Ih current &#8211; another characteristic feature of SNc neurons in vivo or in acute brain slices. In addition, atypical responses to CNQX (blocker of NMDA receptors) and baclofen (blocker of GABAB receptors) application were identified in GFP-positive neurons. These results demonstrate that the culturing process used in this study alters the functional &#8216;phenotype&#8217; of dopaminergic neurons, a change which needs to be considered in future studies using this preparation. Chronic exposure of organotypic cultures to low concentration of rotenone (50 nM) evoked a delayed increase of PI labelling indicative of cell death, however technical limitations prevented detection of PI co-localization with GFP was observed. In conclusion, this study identified several key aspects of 6 OHDA and rotenone toxicity in SNc neurons. The most significant novel findings include evidence for ROS activation of KATP channels, presumed involvement of TRPM2 channels in rotenone-induced [Ca2+]i rise, and dopamine-analogous effects of 6 OHDA. The controversial role of KATP channels in neuroprotection was addressed. Findings from this study suggest therapies targeting this channel alone would be of little benefit. The proposed involvement of TRPM2 channels in rotenone-induced [Ca2+]i overload in SNc neurons is particularly interesting as it provides a mechanism for synergism between rotenone and other factors that disrupt [Ca2+]i homeostasis.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Parkinson's Disease</field><field name="subject">Neurotoxicity</field><field name="subject">Intracellular Calcium</field><field name="subject">Reactive Oxygen Species</field><field name="subject">Mitochondria</field><field name="subject">Electrophysiology</field><field name="subject">TRPM2</field><field name="subject">KATP</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3378</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ecology and management of alligator weed,  Alternanthera philoxeroides</field><field name="creator">Bassett, Imogen Eleanor</field><field name="description">Invasive plant species in natural ecosystems have been shown to have a wide range of potential impacts on community composition and ecosystem function. Alligator weed (Alternanthera philoxeroides) is invasive in New Zealand and elsewhere. An aggressive competitor and difficult to control, its impacts in productive ecosystems are widely documented. However, little information exists about alligator weed&#8217;s effects in natural ecosystems. This thesis therefore investigated potential effects of alligator weed on decomposition and nutrient cycling, as well as on invertebrate and plant communities in a &#8220;native&#8221; ecosystem, thus integrating effects on ecosystem processes and community composition. These aspects were compared between vegetation dominated by alligator weed or by one of two native sedges, Isolepis prolifer and Schoenoplectus tabernaemontani, in a northern New Zealand lake. In addition, the potential of shading to control alligator weed was assessed. Herbivory by the biocontrol agent Agasicles hygrophila resulted in substantial alligator weed defoliation, differing in timing and magnitude from biomass dynamics of the native sedges. Alligator weed also decomposed faster than either native sedge. Changes in decomposition dynamics led to a shift towards fungivore dominated beetle communities. This illustrates the potentially complex ecosystem effects of biocontrol agents as well as invasive weeds. Alligator weed decomposition rates and invertebrate communities were more similar to those of I. prolifer than S. tabernaemontani. This pattern was attributed to the greater chemical and architectural similarity of alligator weed to I. prolifer compared with S. tabernaemontani. Invasive plants&#8217; impacts may thus be partially influenced by the degree of similarity between the invasive species and the dominant vegetation they invade. Alligator weed was associated with decreased cover of native plants, potentially placing them at greater risk of local extinction. Greenhouse and field experiments showed that shading significantly reduced alligator weed growth. However, clonal support from unshaded areas, and competitive release from less shade tolerant plants, may potentially impede the success of shade based control. This research demonstrates that alligator weed can have a range of complex and multi-trophic effects in a natural ecosystem. Further, characteristics of both invasive and competing vegetation can influence the success of cultural control methods such as shading.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Invasive species</field><field name="subject">Decomposition</field><field name="subject">Invertebrate</field><field name="subject">Ecology</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3395</field></doc><doc><field name="title">What is the added value of coordination?:an institutional analysis of the United Nations' response to national and regional coordination of human trafficking in the Greater Mekong Subregion</field><field name="creator">Miller, Rebecca Janine</field><field name="description">Since the 1990s, complex global problems such as HIV/AIDS, humanitarian crises, environmental degradation, and human trafficking have presented challenges at scales that transcend the nation-state as a focus for development initiatives. These challenges, in concert with the emergence of new public management rationalities and good governance discourses, have altered the mandates and capacities of different development agencies from NGOs to governments and United Nations (UN) agencies. The UN has the potential to become a leader for coordinated responses, which are seen as a prerequisite for resolving these issues. However, the marketisation and fragmentation of the development field has engendered an environment fraught with complexity, instability, and heightened competitiveness over scarce resources. The problematic nature of coordinating the activities of stakeholders in such an environment is not well understood. Effective coordination must marry ideals of cooperation to the different and often competing interests of stakeholders and to field-based development practices structured along marketised and disaggregated lines. In this thesis I explore what is meant by coordination, how it is being institutionalised, and what can be done to make initiatives more effective. This thesis examines the institutional arrangements devised to coordinate the practices of agencies working to combat human trafficking in the Greater Mekong Subregion. It analyses the institutional forms themselves and the practices that have emerged from them. Using an ethnographic institutional approach, I focus on the workings of a UN Inter-Agency Project (UNIAP) designed to facilitate a coordinated response to human trafficking. My research draws on over 70 interviews with practitioners and government representatives from six countries, as well as close examination of project documents. To analyse this material and the institutional contexts in which they are embedded, I draw upon strands of new institutionalism and the conceptual tools of Pierre Bourdieu. I argue that the structure of the development field itself is not conducive to coordination. However, realising the potential that does exist will require that consultative platforms be built more on incentives (accumulation and exchange of resources) than on trust, equal participation, and neutral power relations. The findings suggest moving beyond the processes of market exchange toward a more realistic appraisal of hierarchies, markets, and networks as modes of governance and coordination.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3396</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The ecology of spiny lobsters (Jasus edwardsii) on fished and unfished reefs</field><field name="creator">Freeman, Debbie</field><field name="description">Knowledge of the interactions among species and communities is vital for their management and protection.  Increasingly, the role of marine protected areas in this regard is being recognised, primarily because of the potential for previously-harvested species to increase in density and biomass, and the linkages among species to be restored.  Monitoring and research was conducted within and surrounding two marine reserves on the east coast of the North Island of New Zealand &#8211; Te Tapuwae o Rongokako, near Gisborne, and Te Angiangi, south of Napier.  The aim was to describe the biological characteristics of spiny lobsters (Jasus edwardsii) in the absence of fishing, and to describe the effects of fishing and protection on lobster populations and the communities of which they are a component.  Diver and pot surveys showed that lobsters were significantly more abundant within the reserves than in the surrounding fisheries and that the populations were comprised of a larger proportion of legal-sized individuals.  Higher female fecundity within Te Tapuwae o Rongokako Marine Reserve compared with the surrounding fishery was proposed to be primarily a result of increased availability of large males within the reserve.  The impact of the fishery on lobsters was also evidenced in the lower tail width to carapace length ratio of the fished population compared to the population within Te Tapuwae o Rongokako Marine Reserve, due to the minimum legal size for Jasus edwardsii in New Zealand being based on tail width.  The largest tagging study ever to be conducted in a New Zealand marine reserve showed that sublegal male lobsters within Te Tapuwae o Rongokako Marine Reserve were growing on average faster than the same sized individuals outside the reserve, potentially as a result of the effects of handling and / or size-selective fishing.  A decrease in growth rate over time was recorded in male lobsters within the reserve, which coincided with an increase in catch per unit effort and may indicate that density-dependent effects are operating.  Distinct seasonal movements of tagged lobsters were recorded, with the vast majority of movements taking place within reefs.  Where the boundaries of the reserve crossed reef habitat, significant movement of lobsters across the boundaries occurred.  Lobsters within Te Tapuwae o Rongokako Marine Reserve not only exhibited cannibalistic behaviour but foraged during the day, including on intertidal reef platforms at high tide, potentially as a behavioural response to increased competition for food &#8211; behaviour not previously reported for this species.  Outside the reserve, lobster bait apparently provided an alternative protein source but despite this supplementation of diet, these lobsters were in poorer nutritional condition, as evidenced by their lower body weights relative to carapace length and tail width for both sexes.  Lobsters outside the reserve were also significantly more affected by a bacterial infection associated with handling, than lobsters within the reserve.  These findings have significant implications for fisheries management and for the design and management of marine protected areas (MPAs).  This study demonstrates that many of the biological parameters used in evaluating harvest strategies in the New Zealand lobster fishery may be biased unless collected from populations with a natural size structure, such as may occur within marine protected areas.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">lobster</field><field name="subject">marine reserves</field><field name="subject">MPAs</field><field name="subject">effects of fishing</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270500 Zoology::270504 Invertebrate biology</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270700 Ecology and Evolution::270702 Marine and estuarine ecology (incl. marine ichthyology)</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3363</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The incidence and phylogenetic analysis of viruses infecting New Zealand's native grasses</field><field name="creator">Delmiglio, Catia.</field><field name="description">Grasses form the basis for the meat, dairy, wool and deer industries, which contribute to nearly 50% of New Zealand exports, and are also an important component of natural ecosystems. Worldwide &gt;100 plant viruses infect grass species and even mild and symptomless infections can adversely effect plant populations through reduced reproductive rates and greater susceptibility to environmental extremes. The only previously published study on viruses in New Zealand&#8217;s natural grasslands found that cereal viruses have invaded the native grass flora of the South Island. This research provided an extensive survey of New Zealand native grasses, showing that barley yellow dwarf virus diseases (BYDV, Luteoviridae) and Cocksfoot mottle virus (CoMV, Sobemovirus) are widespread in the North and South islands of New Zealand. Significant findings include seven new virus hosts amongst the New Zealand native flora, the first report of BYDV-PAS in New Zealand, detection in Hierochloe redolens of a novel virus in the Luteoviridae family (proposed name BYDV-To), and in Festuca novae-zelandiae a novel dsRNA virus possibly belonging to the Partitiviridae family. New virus host reports in New Zealand include CoMV in Poa anceps, P. cita, F. novae-zelandiae, and Chionochloa rubra; BYDV-PAV and BYDV-PAS in Microlaena stipoides and Dichelacne crinita; BYDV-MAV in P. cita, F. novae-zelandiae and H. redolens; and CYDV-RPV in P. cita and M. stipoides. Molecular techniques for virus detection and identification were developed or improved during this study. Phylogenetic analyses of viral coat protein sequences from native and exotic grass species indicate either frequent or recent virus movement into native ecosystems, and multiple virus introduction events in New Zealand. The likely origins of the virus species are discussed. Two CoMV variants were identified, one of which caused severe necrosis in susceptible cocksfoot cultivars. Reciprocal aphid transmission of BYDV-PAV using cereals and native grasses showed that although transmission to natives was low, the efficiency of transmission from natives to cereals was comparable to that between cereal species, suggesting virus adaptation to the cereal host species. The findings from this study are discussed in respect to disease management and bio-security in New Zealand, and recommendations are made for future research.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270400 Botany</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3364</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Structure function studies on lectin nucleotide phosphohydrolases (LNPs)</field><field name="creator">Chen, Chunhong</field><field name="description">Lectin nucleotide phosphohydrolases (LNPs) are proteins which possess both apyrase catalytic activity (E.C. 3.6.1.5) and specific carbohydrate binding properties, and these are linked. To investigate the structural and functional properties for these proteins, two putative soluble plant LNPs, 4WC and 7WC (from white clover), and a putative soluble plant apyrase 6RG (from ryegrass) were chosen. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies for each plant apyrase were generated using highly purified, overexpressed recombinant 4WC or 7WC. In the case of 6RG, the C-terminal half of the protein constituted the best antigen for generating polyclonal antibodies. These antibodies showed high specificity and sensitivity. Active, recombinant 4WC and 6RG were overexpressed and purified using the baculoviral insect cell expression system (4WCbac-sup and 6RG:Hisbac), while 7WC (7WCcoli) was produced from E. coli inclusion bodies and subsequently refolded to give active enzyme. In course of overexpression, recombinant 4WC was localised in both the cellular fraction (4WCbac) and in the media supernatant (4WCbac-sup), while recombinant 6RG:Hisbac was only found in the cellular fraction (6RG:Hisbac) indicating that it was not secreted during insect cell growth. Secretion of 4WCbac was found to be dependent on N-glycosylation at N313 but not at N85 and elimination of one or both of these sites appeared to have little influence on apyrase activity. In addition, both 4WCbac and 6RG:Hisbac from the cellular fraction were fully functional. These results were compared with similar work performed on the animal ecto-apyrases which have different specific N-glycosylation sites required for secretion and activity. The 4WCbac-sup, 7WCcoli and 6RG:Hisbac proteins all showed apyrase activity, that is they catalysed the hydrolysis of nucleotide tri- and/or di-phosphates to their corresponding nucleotide monophosphates, and released inorganic phosphate in a divalent cation-dependent manner. However, the proteins exhibited different activities, substrate specificities, pH profiles and influence of inhibitors: 4WCbac-sup had a preference for NDPs with a pH optimum &#8805;9.5; 7WCcoli had a modest preference for NTPs with a pH optimum at 8.5; 6RG:Hisbac was almost exclusively an NTPase with a pH optimum at 6.5. Contrary to predictions based on phylogeny the proteins all bound to sulphated disaccharides and their catalytic activities were influenced both positively and negatively by the binding of specific chitosans. The data indicates that all three soluble plant apyrases investigated here were LNPs, in contrast to predictions from the literature. In order to pinpoint the regions responsible for determining substrate specificity and chitosan binding, chimeras were made using the N- and C-terminal halves of 4WC and 6RG. This resulted in fully functional reciprocal chimeras. Comparison of the apyrase activity for parents and chimeras, substrate specificity, optimal pH, influence of inhibitors on activity and effects of chitosans indicated that the C-terminus was responsible for determining substrate specificity. However, the influence of specific chitosans on the chimeras appeared to be dependent on both the N- and C-terminal portions of the proteins. In addition, chimeras were found to bind to the same sulphated disaccharides as the parent proteins. Preliminary crystal screening experiments were performed with highly purified preparations of 7WCcoli and 6RG:Hisbac. Under specific conditions 7WCcoli was found to form cube-like crystalline arrangements while 6RG:Hisbac formed hexagonal-like crystalline structures. A potential model for carbohydrate binding by LNPs is proposed and the possible biological roles of plant LNPs are discussed.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Apyrase</field><field name="subject">lectin</field><field name="subject">prokaryotic and eukaryotic protein expression</field><field name="subject">chimeras</field><field name="subject">glycosylation</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270100 Biochemistry and Cell Biology::270108 Enzymes</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3369</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Maximizing Information: Applications of Ideal Point Modeling and Innovative Item Design to Personality Measurement</field><field name="creator">Leeson, Heidi Vanessa</field><field name="description">Recent research has challenged the way in which personality and attitude constructs are measured. Alternatives have been offered as to how non-cognitive responses are modeled, the mode of delivery used when administrating such scales, and the impact of technology in measuring personality. Thus, the major purpose of the studies in this thesis concerns two interrelated issues of personality research, namely the way personality responses are best modeled, and the most optimal mode by which personality items are presented and associated modal issues. Three studies are presented. First, recent developments using an ideal point approach to scale construction are outlined, and an empirical study compares modeling personality items based on an ideal point approach (generalized graded unfolding model; GGUM) and a dominance approach (graded response model: GRM). Second, an extensive review of literature pertaining to the mode effect when transferring paper-and-pencil measures to screen was conducted, in addition to a review of the various types of computerized and innovative items and their associated psychometric information. Finally, nine innovative items were developed using various multimedia features (e.g., video, graphics, and audio) to ascertain the advantages of these methods to present items constructed to elicit response behavior underlying ideal point approaches, namely, typical response behavior. It was found that the dominance IRT model continued to produce superior model-data fit for most items, more attention needs to be placed on developing principles for constructing ideal point type items, the web-based version supplied 20% more construct information than the paper version, and innovative items seem to provide more data-model fit for students with lower personality attributes. While the innovative items may require more initial outlay in terms of time and development costs, they have the capacity to provide more information regarding test-takers&#8217; personality levels, potentially using fewer items.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Ideal Point Theory</field><field name="subject">Innovative items</field><field name="subject">Web-based testing</field><field name="subject">Computer-based testing</field><field name="subject">Personality measurement</field><field name="subject">Psychometrics</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology::380104 Personality, abilities and assessment</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education::330100 Education Studies::330109 Assessment and evaluation</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education::330100 Education Studies::330107 Educational technology and media</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3405</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Polynesian architecture in New Zealand.</field><field name="creator">Austin, Michael Robert</field><field name="description">Polynesian architecture has tended to be neglected or dismissed as a field of serious study by architects in New Zealand.

Through better communication and considering the structure and foundation as an integrated system, new opportunities may arise for achieving superior performance. This thesis investigates the seismic performance of the integrated system through the development of integrated structure-foundation models using the Ruaumoko structural analysis program. A detailed representation of the structural and foundation systems was created using Ruaumoko, providing insight into the response of a range of integrated structure-foundation systems during seismic loading. In developing both shallow and deep foundation models, some modifications were made to Ruaumoko elements in order to improve the foundation model, but generally existing element configurations were used to represent foundations. Multiple structural and foundation designs were developed using a range of approaches. Use of a range of shallow foundation design methods identified the significant impact that moment loading had on foundation performance. Partial uplift of footings was identified as detrimental to footing performance as it shifted the rotational axes, increasing moment loads and reducing effective footing area. Pinned connections between the structure and shallow footings eliminated these effects at the expense of significant redistribution of actions in the structure and increased displacements. Variation of soil conditions showed that softer soil was most likely to reduce demands on the structure at the expense of foundation non-linearity. Reduced stiffness and increased radiation damping characteristics of raft foundations compared to footing foundation systems reduced the demands on three storey structures for all soil conditions. Increased structural demands were identified for the ten storey structure as a result of the reduced impact of foundation characteristics on the response of the integrated system. The level of rotational restraint at the head of pile foundations had a considerable effect on the structure and the foundation, with free-head piles developing the largest pile displacements and actions. Reduced rotational stiffness caused a substantial change in the distribution of structural actions, while increasing rotational restraint moved the characteristics closer to the response of fixed base models. Softer soil conditions greatly increased non-linearity in the foundation soil without any definitive improvement in structural performance.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Earthquake Engineering</field><field name="subject">Soil Structure Interaction</field><field name="subject">Analytical Modelling</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3428</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Leaving a lot to be desired? Sex therapy and the discourses of heterosex</field><field name="creator">Guerin, Bernadette M.</field><field name="description">In this thesis I explore the social construction of sexuality and sexual dysfunction. Interviews were undertaken with 20 sex therapists practising in Aotearoa/New Zealand in order to elicit accounts of contemporary sex therapy practice in the local context. Using a feminist poststructuralist lens, I explicate and critically examine the dominant discourses informing the construction of sex therapy, and heterosexual sexual relations, and what these discourses enable and constrain. I draw attention to some of the assumptions embedded in the construction of the sexual dysfunctions in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV-TR, APA, 2000), and in accounts of sex therapy practice, examining the ways in which these are based on taken-for-granted norms of (hetero)sexuality and highlighting the differently enabled gendered sexual subjectivities they (re)produce. Although there are nine sexual dysfunctions identified in the DSM-IV-TR, all of which I briefly outline in Chapter Four, I restrict my focus in the analytical chapters to the conceptualisation and treatment of vaginismus, orgasm difficulties in women, discrepancies in desire and, relatedly, the gendering of desire through powerful sociocultural discourses and representations. I pay particular attention to the implications of these for heterosexual women&#8217;s sexuality. I also explore some of the generic concepts that dominate the construction of therapy at a broader level than that of sex therapy alone, arguing that while these offer some useful ways of framing therapy they also constrain therapy practice in important ways. Through a critical review of the sex therapy literature and accounts of practice from those interviewed, I contend that contemporary sex therapy tends to reify dominant cultural and sexological norms rather than challenge them. My analyses show that the dominant discourses informing constructions of sex therapy and heterosexual sexual relations produce particular types of sex as normal whilst marginalizing sexual acts or practices that fall outside of such restrictive parameters. In particular, I argue that the genital-coital-orgasm construct that is hegemonic within sex therapy restricts possibilities for alternative erotic pleasures and possibilities amongst heterosexuals whilst contributing to the invisibilization of sexual identities other than heterosexual. Accounts of sex therapy practice that were able to contest such framings are also highlighted. Because these came from sex therapists drawing on radical feminist or feminist poststructuralist discourses, I suggest that these discourses offer important possibilities for a deconstructive (sex) therapy practice that is able to challenge an often inequitable sexual status quo. Attention is also drawn to the significant constraints which act to restrict clients&#8217; choices and possibilities for sex therapists to practise in more critically questioning ways. I conclude this thesis with an &#8216;invitation to reflection&#8217; where I briefly discuss some deconstructive approaches that I have found useful for developing ongoing reflexive analysis of my own taken-for-granted assumptions in the area of sexuality, and for aiding my thinking about therapeutic practices that support my political and theoretical commitments and that attend to some of the issues outlined in this thesis.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">social construction of sexuality</field><field name="subject">social constructionism</field><field name="subject">feminist poststructuralism</field><field name="subject">feminist poststructuralist approach to sexuality</field><field name="subject">sexual dysfunction</field><field name="subject">sexual disorders</field><field name="subject">heterosexual sexual relations</field><field name="subject">sexuality</field><field name="subject">heterosex</field><field name="subject">dominant discourses of sexuality</field><field name="subject">sex therapy</field><field name="subject">deconstruction of sex therapy practices</field><field name="subject">orgasm difficulties</field><field name="subject">vaginismus</field><field name="subject">desire discrepancy</field><field name="subject">gendering of desire</field><field name="subject">deconstructive approaches to sex therapy</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3454</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Virtual Reality Simulation of Hip Surgery</field><field name="creator">Blyth, Phil</field><field name="description">This thesis describes the design and application of a virtual reality simulator for orthopaedic surgeryof the proximal femur. The aim of the research was to create a simulator with the followingattributes; could be used within the current public hospital setting, reflected the perceived needs ofthe local orthopaedic community, provided surgically relevant feedback about aspects of technicalability to orthopaedic surgical trainees and the training committee, allowed practice of operativetasks which for reasons of radiation exposure could otherwise not occur, was validated, and couldbe developed further for other operations. The ultimate aim of the simulator is to allow trainees topractice aspects of surgical treatment such that their care of real patients is improved. The novel aspect of this work has been the development of a simulator which allows the trainee toperform all the steps required for two surgical procedures; namely hip fracture fixation and pinningof slipped femoral capital epiphyses. The simulator runs on the computers found within the publichospital as it does not require expensive hardware such as haptic (force feedback) devices. Resultsfrom the simulator mimic real world measurements which are seldom available to trainees asfeedback to enable them to practice their craft. A survey of the New Zealand orthopaedic surgeons and advanced trainees showed this communitywas generally supportive of simulation, though only 4 respondents had previous experience with asurgical simulator. The task of practicing angulation/spatial orientation was thought most suitablefor simulation, which is the task which the simulator specifically allows trainees to practice. Morerecently qualified surgeons were more likely to agree that simulation was an effective way topractice surgical procedures. Validation of the simulator was tested in two experiments. The simulator was shown to have facevalidity; i.e. a realistic representation of the operating room. This result was obtained by surveyingusers who had completed a number of virtual operations. Construct validity was assessed by thesimulator&#8217;s ability to identify between groups of users with differing levels of real surgicalexperience. The simulator was able to discriminate medical students from orthopaedic trainees,despite the medical students&#8217; greater ability in computer-gaming. Advanced trainees generallyperformed better than basic trainees, though in the limited number of trainees available significancewas not reached. Finally the simulator was developed further to allow all advanced trainees within New Zealand tocomplete virtual pin placement of a slipped capital femoral epiphysis. This demonstrated thefeasibility of using the simulator for assessment of trainees within their normal training weekend. Italso revealed different operating styles, and showed how these differing styles do not correlate withthe accuracy with which the final screw is placed.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Virtual Reality</field><field name="subject">Simulation</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/4235</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The substance of the shadow: M&#257;ori and P&#257;keh&#257; political economic relationships, 1860-1940: a far northern case study</field><field name="creator">Puckey, Adrienne, 1946</field><field name="description">Between 1860 and 1940 Aotearoa New Zealand&#8217;s economy and economic base was transformed in a number of significant ways, following similar patterns in earlier-established British colonies. The influx of European immigrants drastically altered the demography and contested land &#8211; the economic base. Money became increasingly important as medium of exchange and unit of account. Whereas the economy was unregulated or lightly-regulated before 1860, regulation increasingly formalised economic relations and institutions, and work organisation became more impersonal. In urban areas these transformations were substantially complete by 1940. However, in rural areas, where most M&#228;ori and fewer P&#228;keh&#228; lived, economic transformation was more of a hybrid than a complete change from one form to another. The informal economy (unmeasured and unregulated), and particularly the rural informal economy, contributed (and still contributes) quantitatively to the national economy. Whether within M&#228;ori communities, within P&#228;keh&#228; communities or between the two, the more informal rural economy depended on social relations to a large extent. M&#228;ori had choices about how they related to the introduced economic system, ranging from full engagement to rejection and non-involvement, with numerous negotiated positions in between. With the conviction that they could satisfactorily negotiate terms of participation, M&#228;ori had invited Europeans to the far north. The extent of M&#228;ori involvement in all the dominant (formal) economic activities of the far north, 1860-1940, clearly indicates their efforts were integral rather than peripheral to the P&#228;keh&#228; economy. But M&#228;ori economic activity has been relegated to the shadows of economic history. The relationship between the two systems is better understood by recognising the interplay between formal and informal (shadow) economies. The social organisation of work, the kaupapa of the informal economy, the diversity of strategies and tactics, and relationship building (both bonding and bridging), were the strengths from which far northern M&#228;ori relentlessly engaged with the P&#228;keh&#228; economy, while maintaining a degree of autonomy until World War One. In effect they played an invisible hand of cards, invisible, that is, to studies of the formal economy.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::430000 History and Archaeology::430100 Historical Studies::430101 History: New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::430000 History and Archaeology::430100 Historical Studies::430102 History: Maori</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3387</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Robust and integrated airline scheduling</field><field name="creator">Weide, Oliver</field><field name="description">In airline scheduling a variety of planning and operational decision problems have to be solved. In this thesis we consider the problems aircraft routing and crew pairing: aircraft and crew must be allocated to flights of a schedule in a minimal cost way.  Although these problems are not independent, they are usually formulated as independent mathematical optimisation models and solved sequentially. This approach might lead to a suboptimal allocation of aircraft and crew, since a solution of one of the problems may restrict the set of feasible solutions of the problem solved subsequently.  Also, in minimal cost solutions, aircraft and crew are highly utilised and short turn around times are usually used for aircraft and crew. If such a solution is used in operations, a short delay of one flight can cause very severe disruptions of the schedule later in the day due to the lack of buffer times. We formulate an integrated aircraft routing and crew pairing  model that can generate solutions that incur small costs and are also robust to typical stochastic variability in airline operations.  We propose two new solution methods to solve the integrated model. The first approach is an optimisation based heuristic approach that is capable of generating good quality solutions quickly, the second approach can solve the integrated model to optimality.  In an extension of the integrated model we allow the departure times of some flights in the schedule to vary in some time window. This creates additional flexibility that leads to aircraft routing and crew pairing solutions with improved cost and robustness compared to the integrated model without time windows.  Using data from domestic Air New Zealand schedules, we evaluate the benefits of the approaches on real world problem instances. Our solutions satisfy all rules imposed for these problems and are ready to be implemented in practice. We generate solutions that dramatically improve the cost and robustness of solutions obtained by existing methods.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">airline scheduling</field><field name="subject">robust</field><field name="subject">integrated</field><field name="subject">set partitioning</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/4237</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Accessing the in between: The conditions of possibility emerging from interactions with information and communications technologies in Auckland, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Mitchell, Phillipa Marlis</field><field name="description">The complex interactions between individuals, institutions and information and communications technologies (ICTs) have generated a growing body of research that seeks greater knowledge of the processes at work and their consequences. Situated firmly within this area, this thesis challenges the dominance of the generalised and largely technologically deterministic narratives within the field by seeking to constitute such knowledge in a different way.  Geography provides a useful standpoint from which to challenge these narratives owing to its enduring engagement with time and space, concepts implicit in any discussion of ICTs effects.  Emerging work on code space, transurbanism and timespace are specifically used to negate the persistent dualistic treatment of time and space which is argued to be hampering geographic research in this field.  Methodologically drawing from a non representational style this thesis uses these emerging understandings to access the in between, a mental space of performance; which involves the process of drawing from tacit knowledge, cognitive perceptions of the spatial and temporal environment and emotions, in order to explore the conditions of possibility that individuals are becoming aware of through their interactions with ICTs.  Four empirical interventions are used to ground these emerging understandings into the reality of everyday encounters with ICTs in Auckland, New Zealand.  The first focuses on the role of local government in the development of Auckland&#8217;s ICT infrastructure, a complex and contingent process.  The second concentrates on the provision of a Real Time Passenger Information System at Auckland bus stops, exposing individuals to new timespaces while waiting for the bus.  The third considers students opinions of the e-learning mechanisms used in two first year geography courses.  The final intervention examines the role ICTs play in South Africans and South Koreans imagining, negotiation and mediation of the migration process to Auckland.  In conclusion, this thesis contributes to how geography constitutes knowledge about ICTs at three different levels.  Empirically, the four interventions contribute grounded findings to the debates in the geographic literature over interactions with ICTs.  Methodologically, the conditions of possibility institutional and individual actors are beginning to perceive through their encounters with ICTs are revealed as are the timespaces that may eventuate from these. Theoretically, to understand how the interactions between individuals and ICTs are performed this thesis demonstrates the need to interrogate the in between as a process, not just a gap or blank.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">information and communications technologies</field><field name="subject">time</field><field name="subject">space</field><field name="subject">geography</field><field name="subject">non representational theory</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370400 Human Geography</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3456</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Automated techniques for formal verification of SoCs</field><field name="creator">Sinha, Roopak</field><field name="description">System-on-a-chip (SoC) designs have gained immense popularity as they provide designers with the ability of integrating all components (called IPs) of an application-specific computer system onto a single chip. However, one of the main bottlenecks of the SoC design cycle is the validation of complex designs. As system size grows, validation time increases beyond manageable limits. It is desirable that design inconsistences are found and fixed early in the design process, as validation overheads are significantly higher after IPs are integrated. This thesis presents a range of techniques for the automatic verification and design of SoCs that aim to reduce post-integration validation costs. Firstly, local module checking algorithm, a practical implementation of module checking, is presented. This technique allows for the comprehensive verification of IPs such that they guarantee the satisfaction of critical specifications regardless of the SoC they are used in. Local module checking is shown to be able to validate IPs in much lesser time on average than global module checking, and can help in handling many important validation tasks much before the integration stage. Next, a number of protocol conversion techniques that assist in the composition of IPs with incompatible protocols is presented. The inconsistencies between IP protocols, called mismatches, are bridged by the automatic generation of some extra glue-logic, called a converter. Converters generated by the proposed techniques can handle control, datawidth and clock mismatches between multiple IPs in a unified manner. These approaches ensure that the integration of IPs is correct-by-construction, such that the final system is guaranteed to satisfy key specifications without the need for further validation. Finally, a technique for automatic IP reuse using forced simulation is presented, which involves automatically generating an adaptor that guides an IP such that it satisfies desired specifications. The proposed technique can generate adaptors in many cases where existing IP techniques fail. As it is guaranteed that reused IPs satisfy desired specifications, post-integration validation costs are significantly reduced. For each proposed technique, a comprehensive set of results is presented that highlights the significance of the solution. It is noted that the proposed approaches can help automate SoC design and achieve significant savings in post-integration validation costs.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/4238</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The development of pavement deterioration models on the state highway network of New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Henning, Theunis F.P.</field><field name="description">This thesis presents the results of developing road pavement deterioration models for the State Highway network in New Zealand pavement deterioration models are an integral part of pavement management systems, which are used to forecast long-term maintenance needs and funding requirements on a road network.  As part of this research, a Long-term Pavement Performance (LTPP) programme has been established on 63 sections of the State Highways.  These sections are representative of typical road sections and climatic conditions on New Zealand roads.  Data collection on these sections is undertaken on an annual basis and consists of high accuracy manual measurements.  These measurements include road roughness, rutting, visual defect identification and strength testing with a Falling Weight Deflectometer. Based on the LTPP data, new model formats for New Zealand conditions were developed including a crack initiation model and a three-stage rut progression model.  The rut progression model consists of three stages, initial densification, stable rut growth and a probabilistic model to predict accelerated rut progression.  The continuous probabilistic model developed predicts the initiation of pavement failure events such as crack initiation and accelerated rutting.  It has been found that this model type has a strong agreement with actual pavement behaviour as it recognises a distribution of failure on roads rather than failure occurring at an particular point in time, namely, a year.  The modelling of rut progression in the three stages including, initial densification, stable rut progression and accelerated rutting has resulted in a significant increased understanding of this defect, especially for thin flexible chip seal pavements.  It has been established that the in-service performance of these pavements is relatively predictable.  However, incorporating both the in-service performance and the failure of pavements into one model was unrealistic.  Therefore, by having the different stages of rutting, resulted into a more accurate forecasting of this defect. Although this research has covered the two priority pavement models including cracking and rutting prediction, it has established the model framework for other pavement models to be developed.  As more data become available, further work can be undertaken to refine the models and to extend the research into the performance of alternative construction materials.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">pavement deterioration</field><field name="subject">pavement models</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/4236</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Shining new light on motoneurons: characterization of motoneuron dendritic spines using light microscopy and novel analytical methods</field><field name="creator">McMorland, Angus John Cathcart</field><field name="description">Dendritic spines are fundamental units of information processing within the nervous system, responsible for independent modulation of synaptic input to neurons. Filopodia, often morphologically indistinguishable from spines, are involved in formation of synapses during neuronal development. Despite the importance of these structures for neuronal function, no detailed study of their presence on motoneurons has yet been made. Here, the presence of spines on hypoglossal motoneurons (HMs) is described at three developmental stages: at P0&#8211;2 and P9&#8211;11, spines are present at an average density of ~0.1 spines/micron, but at P19 spine density becomes negligible. In P0&#8211;2 and P9&#8211;11, spines are nonuniformly distributed, occuring in clusters, and at lower density in the most proximal and distal regions to the soma than at intermediate regions. HM spines coincide with a decrease in cell input resistance, which reduces excitability during development. Thus one may speculate that these spines are involved in the formation of new synapses required to maintain adequate excitatory drive. A major difficulty for the study of spines is their small size, which complicates measurement using optical methods. Here, I present a novel method for reconstructing spine morphology using geometric models based on a priori knowledge of spine structure. Tests of the technique using simulated data indicate that it has a resolving capability of up to 40 nm (limited by noise). The technique has been used to measure dendritic spines on HMs, showing that these structures have necks as small as 0.22 micron. For purely passive modulation of synaptic strength, spine necks need to be &lt;~ 0.15 micron. These data suggest that if modulation of synaptic input occurs, biochemical and/or active electrical processes are needed. The methods developed in this Thesis, which have here been applied to HMs, are generally applicable to the study of spine morphology, and its effect on synaptic processing, in all classes of neurons.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">neuroscience</field><field name="subject">microscopy</field><field name="subject">dendritic spines</field><field name="subject">high resolution</field><field name="subject">two-photon</field><field name="subject">fluorescence</field><field name="subject">mice</field><field name="subject">motoneuron</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::320700 Neurosciences::320702 Central nervous system</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::320600 Medical Physiology::320602 Cell physiology</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::240000 Physical Sciences::249900 Other Physical Sciences::249903 Instruments and techniques</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/4268</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Justice in context: judging battered women defendants: a New Zealand case study</field><field name="creator">Simmonds, Sally Charlotte.</field><field name="description">The purpose of the thesis is to analyse the practical limits and scope of the substantive concept and principles of justice in response to a growing philosophical scepticism about the relevance and substance of the virtue of justice in the modern world. This critical reflection on justice is set in an actual context of considerable controversy surrounding the commitment to justice and compelling claims about the failure of the &#8216;justice system&#8217; to fulfil those commitments. This context encompasses debates and decisions about justice for battered women defendants. The first part of the thesis develops an extended empirical case study of the New Zealand &#8216;justice system&#8217; centred on the 1994 trial of Gay Oakes who killed her abusive husband and was convicted of his murder. Using this legal case as a critical point of departure for reflection on New Zealand&#8217;s commitment to justice for battered women defendants and for women victims of domestic violence more broadly, the case study includes a detailed overview of the legal, political and cultural aspects of New Zealand&#8217;s changing commitment to justice for battered women, concentrating on the twenty-year period between 1987 and 2007. The study overall reveals the complexity of the justice challenge in this context and raises serious concerns about the ongoing failure to meet the demands of justice in spite of significant progress made. The second part of the thesis engages in analytical reflection on the key principles of justice conceptualised in western political philosophy and underpinning the institutionalised commitment to justice in New Zealand. Divided into three distinct principles of justice &#8211; the principle of equal treatment or formal justice, the principle of equal consent, and the principle of just deserts &#8211; the analysis in this part of the thesis endeavours to translate each principle of justice defined in abstraction, based on hypothetical and universal dilemmas, to apply in specific contexts of judging what justice demands for battered women defendants. Although serious complexities of &#8216;translation&#8217; arise in each case, the analysis points to the conclusion that the sceptics are wrong to doubt the substance and relevance of justice, and that justice remains an important legal, political and moral virtue capable of guiding judgments in complex contexts.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3429</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Stable isotope analysis of prehistoric human and commensal diet on Aitutaki, southern Cook Islands</field><field name="creator">Craig, Jacqueline Anne</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates the prehistoric diet of humans and two of their key commensals on Aitutaki using stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes.  This technique gives us new insight into the diet of these three groups and results are considered in the context of the development of agricultural systems on Aitutaki, as well as in light of the wider context of cultural developments and environmental change in the Cook Islands and Polynesia as a whole.  Ultimately, it allows us to more fully understand the complex interactions between humans and the two largest commensals in order to evaluate the utility of these animals as proxies for humans in dietary analyses. The results indicate that the prehistoric human diet on Aitutaki can be characterised as mixed, dominated by terrestrial plants and marine protein with lesser amounts of terrestrial protein.  While the amount of protein eaten by the individuals was very similar, they varied in how much marine or terrestrial protein they ate.  The pigs had a slightly more terrestrial diet, with a greater emphasis on plant foods.  Their protein intake was more variable and terrestrial in nature than the humans&#8217;.  Dogs had a higher trophic level, more marine-oriented, diet than either humans or pigs. Like the humans, their diet contained more variation in the source of their protein.  Overall, however, the diets of all three groups were very similar. While the overall nature of the human, pig and dog diets, and their relationships to one another, remained relatively constant over time, beginning in the 14th century they show a decline in the amount of fish consumed and had a more terrestrial diet overall.  This confirms trends seen in the archaeofaunal assemblages, and throws light on the relationship between environmental change and human subsistence practices in East Polynesia. The similarity of the pig and dog diets to human diet, and the fact that the relationship remained constant over time, demonstrates the usefulness of the Aitutaki commensal animals as proxies for humans in stable isotope analysis. However, the specifics of that relationship vary by species and by place.  While the individual dietary variability provides us with new ways of looking at dietary change within populations, it also demonstrates the importance of obtaining as large an assemblage for analysis as possible in order to ensure that samples are representative of the population as a whole.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">stable isotopes</field><field name="subject">carbon</field><field name="subject">nitrogen</field><field name="subject">palaeodiet</field><field name="subject">human</field><field name="subject">pig</field><field name="subject">dog</field><field name="subject">Polynesia</field><field name="subject">Cook Islands</field><field name="subject">Aitutaki</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::430000 History and Archaeology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3441</field></doc><doc><field name="title">New Zealand's National Archives: an analysis of machinery of government reform and resistance, 1994-1999.</field><field name="creator">Molineaux, Julienne</field><field name="description">This thesis analyses the impact of the1990s new public management reforms in New Zealand on one particular agency, the National Archives. It explores the unique combination of features that enabled this small low-profile agency and its stakeholders to stymie some of the machinery of government reforms that were proposed. This thesis is a qualitative study that draws on material from primary and secondary sources, with a heavy reliance on official documents. It chronicles the lack of value placed on the archives&#8217; administrative, constitutional and heritage functions by successive politicians and senior public servants. The thesis compares the values of the reformers, who had interests that were not specific to the Archives, and the values of the archiving professionals and their stakeholders, whose perspective was agency and policy-specific. The main reform time periods are 1994-2001, and 2005. While the clash between the two sets of values during this time is analysed chronologically, the thesis provides historical background prior to the reform period. The perspectives of various actors are told in their own words, where possible. This study illustrates the tensions between the need to co-ordinate the wider public sector with the peculiarities of a specific policy area. It also demonstrates the tensions between the highly theoretical and ideological nature of the public sector management reforms in New Zealand from the mid-1980s, and the values of one group of professionals that were not compatible with these reforms. While the policies of the reformers evolved over time, the values of the archivists were more static. These static values contributed to consistency in their preferred model of organisational design and placement within the public sector. Ironically the outdated legislation archivists complained about for decades and low political priority the policy area received, bestowed crucial protection against public sector management reforms that were contrary to international archival trends. Following a change in political leadership, the stable of professional values of the archive were adopted, removing archives from the policy change agenda.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::360000 Policy and Political Science::360100 Political Science</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3869</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Creative girls: fashion design education and governmentality</field><field name="creator">Bill, Amanda Elizabeth</field><field name="description">This thesis is concerned with creativity as an object of educational governance and a category of subjective identification. It studies a &#8216;creativity explosion&#8217; in higher education in New Zealand, focusing on how fashion design students are being mobilized as subjects of creativity through &#8216;joined up&#8217; modes of governance and technologies of educational choice. Using a poststructural ethnographic &#8216;methodology&#8217; I explain how, from the late 1990s, models of educational governance began to appear dysfunctional and unable to deliver the attributes and capacities expected of citizens in a knowledge economy. I argue that creativity gained significance as a result of new ways of &#8216;thinking culture and economy together&#8217;. Neoliberal rhetorics representing creativity as flexible human capital and a generic, transferable skill needed by workers in the new economy, were articulated with liberal humanist notions about creativity, which are commonly understood and performed through the social categories of art. All kinds of individual and institutional actors took advantage of these shifting opportunity structures to position themselves with &#8216;creative&#8217; identities. Within various cultural organisations, including universities, moves to strengthen a liberal agenda and retain creativity as a form of &#8216;arts knowledge&#8217; with high cultural capital, rubbed up against counter-hegemonic strategies to enlist and develop more universal concepts about creativity as a collaborative endeavour, vital to new forms of capitalist enterprise. By historicising the context in which a new &#8216;normative doctrine&#8217; of creativity has emerged, and by treating its theorisation as culturally performative, I develop the position that fashion design graduates, as &#8216;creative girls&#8217;, are highly productive performers in the new categories of cultural economy. However I argue that the creative girl occupies a subject position fitted to after-neoliberalised social and economic arrangements, not because she is shaped by neoliberal ideologies, but because she is made up by techniques and tactics of an &#8216;after-neoliberal&#8217; governmentality. This demonstrates the mutual constitution of &#8216;creative economy&#8217; and &#8216;creative persons&#8217; and underlines the fact that despite after-neoliberal ambitions for managing education, there can be no simple cause and effect relation between higher education and economic performance.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">creativity research</field><field name="subject">creativity pedagogy</field><field name="subject">creative economy</field><field name="subject">sociology of design</field><field name="subject">gender studies</field><field name="subject">youth studies</field><field name="subject">governmental politics</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::220000 Social Sciences, Humanities and Arts-General</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::360000 Policy and Political Science</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::410000 The Arts</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/4234</field></doc><doc><field name="title">La fiction face au pass&#233;: histoire, m&#233;moire et espace-temps dans la fiction litt&#233;raire oc&#233;anienne contemporaine</field><field name="creator">Vigier, Ste&#769;phanie</field><field name="description">Qu&#8217;est-ce que la litt&#233;rature oc&#233;anienne ?

It does not, therefore, purport to be an exhaustive study of the law of contempt in all its protean forms. Rather, its aims are to assess what the law is, and why, and to consider whether it aptly describes the values of the society it purports to protect. The law of contempt has suffered from an excess of dichotomies and classifications which nowhere guarantee its clarity. The most enduring classification is that which distinguishes between criminal and civil contempts, largely on the basis of whether the sanctions which follow are punitive or coercive. Three types of criminal contempt are discussed. Contempt in the face of the court concerns the jurisdiction to punish summarily contumelious behaviour in court. It is argued that, since the summary procedure permits the imposition of sanctions without the usual trial safeguards, the contempt power ought to be limited to the removal of the contemnor from the court. Any more extensive contempt power arguably infringes the freedoms protected by the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990. The law of sub judice contempt seeks to strike a balance between the competing values of freedom of expression and the right to a fair trial. Judicial insistence on the existence of a real risk as a matter of practical reality before the actus reus of this form of contempt is met has effectively restrained criticisms of the rule. Nevertheless, since it can penalise non-negligent practices, it is suggested that sub judice contempt should be treated as a crime of strict liability. The third form of criminal contempt, scandalising a court or judge, is said to be necessary to ensure confidence in the administration of justice. However, there is little evidence that the public perception of the judiciary would suffer through debate over the abilities of its judges. This arm of contempt ought not to be perceived as a form of judicial protectionism. For that reason, and because it arguably infringes the Bill of Rights Act 1990, it is urged that contempt through scandalising a court or judge should be abolished. The law of civil contempt is dealt with through a discussion of breaches of injunctions and undertakings. Since the sanctions which follow may serve both punitive and coercive ends the distinction between this category and the other three is regarded as incomplete. It is contended, however, that there are many similarities between criminal and civil contempts which merit their treatment as a genus. Whenever punitive sanctions are imposed (whether for a criminal or civil contempt) normal trial safeguards ought to exist. On the other hand, if enforcement of a court order is sought, such protection is inappropriate. A procedural approach to the different types of sanctions ought to rid contempt law of perplexing categorisations which fail to address the essential characteristics of the contempt power.</field><field name="date">1990</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::390000 Law, Justice and Law Enforcement::390100 Law</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3439</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Finite element solution of an eikonal equation for excitation wavefront propagation in ventricular mycodium</field><field name="creator">Tomlinson, Karl Antony</field><field name="description">An efficient finite element method is developed to model the spreading of excitation in ventricular myocardium by treating the thin region of rapidly depolarizing tissue as a propagating wavefront. The model is used to investigate the excitation sequence in the full canine ventricular myocardium. The solution to an eikonal&#8211;curvature equation for excitation time is shown to satisfy a reaction&#8211;diffusion equation for the bidomain myocardial model at the wavefront, while the solution to an eikonal&#8211;diffusion equation approximately satisfies the reaction&#8211;diffusion equation in the vicinity of the wavefront. The features of these two eikonal equations are discussed. A Petrov&#8211;Galerkin finite element method with cubic Hermite elements is developed to solve the eikonal&#8211;diffusion equation. The oscillatory errors seen when using the Galerkin weighted residual method with high mesh P&#233;clet numbers are avoided by supplementing the Galerkin weights with C&#8304; continuous functions based on derivatives of the interpolation functions. The ratio of the Galerkin and supplementary weights is a function of the P&#233;clet number such that, for one-dimensional propagation, the error in the solution is within a small constant factor of the optimal error achievable in the trial space. An additional noinflow boundary term is developed to prevent spurious excitation initiating on the boundary. The need for discretization in time is avoided by using a continuation method to gradually introduce the non-linear term of the governing equation. A small amount of artificial diffusion is sometimes necessary. Simulations of excitation are performed using a model of the anisotropic canine ventricular myocardium with 23.55 degrees of freedom for the dependent variable, and results are compared with reported experimental observations. When it was assumed that Purkinje fibres influence propagation only on the endocardial surface, excitation of the entire myocardium was completed in 56 ms. Altering material parameters to represent penetration of the Purkinje fibres beneath the left endocardial surface reduced the completion time to 48 ms. Modelling the effects of the laminar structure of myocardium by reducing the propagation speed by 40% in the direction normal to the layers delayed completion of excitation by only 4%.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::291500 Biomedical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3507</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Flexible software process model</field><field name="creator">Kirk, Diana Caroline</field><field name="description">Many different kinds of process are used to develop software intensive products, but there is little agreement as to which processes give the best results under which circumstances. Practitioners and researchers believe that project outcomes would be improved if the development process was constructed according to project-specific factors. In order to achieve this goal, greater understanding of the factors that most affect outcomes is needed. To improve understanding, researchers build models of the process and carry out studies based on these models. However, current models contain many ambiguities and assumptions, and so it is not clear what the results of the studies mean. The statement of this thesis is that it is possible to create an abstraction of the software development process that will provide a mechanism for comparing software processes and software process models. The long term goal of the research is to provide planners with a means of tailoring the development process on a project by project basis, with the aim of reducing risk and improving outcomes.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences::280300 Computer Software::280302 Software engineering</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences::280100 Information Systems::280111 Conceptual modelling</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/4228</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Post-Lapita developments in the Reef-Santa Cruz Islands, southeast Solomon Islands</field><field name="creator">Doherty, Moira Winifrid</field><field name="description">The Pacific is a world of islands, so human migrations are necessarily part of the story of this world. It is somewhat surprising therefore to find that there are so many points of contention among archaeologists, linguists and biologists about the role that migrations have played in producing culture change in Pacific prehistory -just how many migrations are we talking about, on what scale, by whom, and when, and which discipline provides more reliable evidence? The specifics of the debate may be local, but the substantive issues have broader applicability. This thesis attempts to contribute to the debate by considering the archaeological evidence for a hypothesised migration during the post-Lapita period of people speaking non-Austronesian languages into the Main Reef and Santa Cruz Islands in the southeast Solomon Islands. It describes the theoretical and methodological difficulties in trying to assess whether cladistic or rhizotic processes best account for culture change. Previously unpublished archaeological material from two Main Reef Islands sites is presented, and is compared with the linguistic and human biological evidence pertinent to the case study. The narratives of cross-cultural encounters during the historic period are examined to investigate how such interactions produce change in cultural traditions, and to assess the archaeological visibility of these contacts. While the archaeological record testifies to cultural borrowings and lendings in the Reef-Santa Cruz case, the argument for either large-scale population intrusion or replacement is not well supported. The archaeological record appears to be in conflict with the prevailing interpretation of history reconstructed from historical linguistics and human genetics.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370300 Anthropology::370301 Biological (physical) anthropology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/4240</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Identifying the Classical Theologia Crucis and in this Light Karl Barth's Modern Theology of the Cross</field><field name="creator">Bradbury, Rosalene Clare</field><field name="description">This dissertation is presented in two parts.

He crucially recovers, reshapes and reasserts the classical theologia crucis as a modern theological instrument, one answering enlightened theology&#8217;s self-glorifying accommodation to modernity with the living Word of the cross.  The crucicentric system itself is found to comprise two major theological dimensions, epistemological and soteriological.  Each of these comprises dialectically corresponding aspects connected with false and true creaturely glory.  The cruciform Word (or theology) speaking through this system likewise moves in two directions.  It declares negatively that any attempt by the creature to circumvent the cross so as to know about God directly, or to condition God's electing decision, is necessarily the attempt to know and act as God alone may know and act - an attempt therefore on the glory of God.  It declares positively that in the crucified Christ God formally discloses the knowledge of God, and determines the creature for God.  This knowledge and election are appropriated to the creature as, drawn into the cruciform environment, its attempt to glorify itself is negated and Christ's exalted humanity received in exchange.  Thence it is lifted to participate in Christ's mind and in his glory, a process guided by the Holy Spirit and completed eschatologically.  The database for this research includes selected primary materials in the Apostle Paul, Athanasius, a group of medieval mystical theologians, the reformer Martin Luther - particularly here his Heidelberg Disputation, and Karl Barth.  It also pays attention to the recent secondary literature peripherally or more concertedly connecting itself to the theology of the cross, of whatever period.  In this literature numerous suggestions for the content of the theology of the cross exist, a major methodological task in the current research being to bring these together systematically.  To the extent that the inner structure of the system carrying the cruciform Word has not previously been made explicit, and Barth's crucicentric status not finally determined, in moving towards these achievements this dissertation breaks fresh ground.  In the process a new test by which to decide the crucicentric status of any theological project is developed, and a further and crucicentric way of reading Barth proposed.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">theology of the cross</field><field name="subject">theologia crucis</field><field name="subject">Kreuzestheologie</field><field name="subject">Paul, Apostle</field><field name="subject">Athanasius</field><field name="subject">Bernard of Clairvaux</field><field name="subject">Theologia Germanica</field><field name="subject">Johannes Tauler</field><field name="subject">Nicholas of Cusa</field><field name="subject">Meister Eckhart</field><field name="subject">Luther, Martin</field><field name="subject">Barth, Karl</field><field name="subject">Christology</field><field name="subject">epistemology</field><field name="subject">soteriology</field><field name="subject">eschatology</field><field name="subject">theology of glory</field><field name="subject">theologia gloriae</field><field name="subject">modernity</field><field name="subject">modernism</field><field name="subject">Schleiermacher, Friedrich</field><field name="subject">medieval mysticism</field><field name="subject">medieval mystics</field><field name="subject">Reformation</field><field name="subject">cross</field><field name="subject">crucifixion</field><field name="subject">Jesus Christ</field><field name="subject">Jesus</field><field name="subject">Christ</field><field name="subject">Calvin, John</field><field name="subject">Cappadocian Fathers</field><field name="subject">Antony the Great</field><field name="subject">wisdom</field><field name="subject">foolishness</field><field name="subject">Heidelberg Disputation</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::440000 Philosophy and Religion</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/4261</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Here &amp; now: intimacy, immediacy and authenticity in New Zealand's reality television</field><field name="creator">West, Amy</field><field name="description">ABSTRACT This thesis analyses a range of reality television programmes produced in New Zealand as part of a wider investigation into the affective strategies and discursive practices of the medium of television itself. The capacity of television, and more specifically reality television, to bring things close and render them present - spatially, temporally, socially and emotionally &#8211; is the thematic fulcrum of this study. Closeness is variously interpreted here as proximity (in terms of space, geography or social position), co-incidence (in terms of time) and intimacy (in terms of emotional affect). The present-ness of reality programming is both temporal (occurring now, in the present tense) and physical (occurring here, in this body, in this home, in this country). It is through this affect of present-ness that reality television most clearly engages with the domain of the real. Thus, this study also turns upon a consideration of the various significant ways in which reality television defines, pursues and manifests moments of realness on screen. The thesis is broken down into two parts, entitled Here and Now respectively, reflecting the double axis of spatial (incorporating social) and temporal present-ness. Within this bi-partite structure, six chapters focus in turn on a number of different discursive threads: Viscerality, Ordinariness, Community, Amateurism, Intimacy and Temporal Immediacy, producing a cumulative theoretical framework through which to address reality TV. In terms of methodology, this thesis pursues its exploration of reality television through close textual readings of selected programmes which have been produced for a New Zealand audience. Where appropriate, however, it draws on international examples of reality programming, in particular, those high-profile formats from Europe and the United States which have generated new paradigms for the production and reception of reality television worldwide. In addition, this thesis analyses programme form and content through a range of theoretical frameworks drawn from television studies and other academic disciplines. It also seeks to engage with international critical and academic debates surrounding the often controversial rise of reality programming as a televisual phenomenon in the nineties and into the twenty-first century. The production of this thesis coincides with a surge in academic output on the subject of reality television, and has benefited from recent publications in this area. This thesis attempts to balance both general and specific interests in New Zealand&#8217;s reality programming. On one hand, it places reality television within the context of long-established, international academic discussions about television as a medium, with the intent of showing that reality programming has an innate applicability to the domestic medium out of which it has arisen. On the other, this thesis pursues a more specific project, as it considers locally-produced programming as the particular output of the island nation of New Zealand. In this case, I argue that the particular aesthetic and discursive practices of reality programming, which devolve upon the ordinary, the domestic and the local, are well-suited to the ongoing production of culture and identity in a settler nation such as New Zealand.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">television</field><field name="subject">reality</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::410000 The Arts::410300 Cinema, Electronic Arts and Media Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/4232</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Assessment of seismic damage to civil structures using statistical pattern recognition techniques and time series analysis</field><field name="creator">de Lautour, Oliver R.</field><field name="description">The ability to estimate seismic induced damage to civil infrastructure is undoubtedly one of the most important challenges faced by structural engineers. In this research two complementary methods of damage estimation using either knowledge of the structure and earthquake or recorded structural responses were investigated. These methods gave different natured estimates, either prediction or detection, which are suitable for different applications. Firstly, damage to a structure was predicted based on analysis of structural and ground motion properties. Secondly, damage to a structure was detected and assessed by analysing the structural response under dynamic excitation. In the first approach, basic structural and ground motion properties were used to characterise a broad group of structures and earthquakes. These properties were used as inputs into a Back-Propagation (BP) Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and related to a damage index that quantified the extent of damage to the structure. A set of prior structural analyses was required to train the ANN before useful predictions could be made. Applied to 2D Reinforced Concrete (RC) frames, the method was capable of predicting with good accuracy damage to frames of varying stiffness, strength and topology whilst subjected to a range of ground motion severities. In the second approach, Autoregressive (AR) models were used to fit the acceleration time histories obtained when the structure was in both undamaged and damaged states. The AR coefficients were selected as damage sensitive features and statistical pattern recognition techniques were investigated for interpreting changes in the values of these features caused by damage. Initially, an offline damage detection method was developed in which BP ANNs were used for both classification and quantification tasks where the percentage remaining stiffness at a specific location was estimated. The method was applied to three experimental structures; a 3-storey bookshelf structure, the ASCE Phase II Experimental SHM Benchmark Structure and a RC column. In addition, for damage classification tasks only, the supervised classification techniques of Nearest Neighbour and Learning Vector Quantisation were found to be effective while Self-Organising Maps, an unsupervised classification method, showed promising results. Finally, an online damage detection method was developed based on recursive identification of the AR models using the forgetting factor and Kalman filter approaches. A linear 3-DOF model with time varying stiffness was investigated and the results showed that damage could be detected and quantified as it occurred. Nonlinear damage detection was addressed with the investigation of a 1-DOF bilinear oscillator and a 3- DOF Bouc-Wen hysteretic system. In both cases the on-set of nonlinearity was detected using Outlier analysis.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290800 Civil Engineering::290801 Structural engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/4270</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Clinical trial simulation: disease progression and treatment modifications in Parkinson&#8217;s Disease</field><field name="creator">Chan, Phylinda Lai Sim</field><field name="description">Clinical trial simulation (CTS) and modelling are techniques which play an important role in clinical pharmacology and drug development. The goal of this thesis is to apply techniques in CTS and modelling for studying disease progression and the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of levodopa in Parkinson's disease. Three components of levodopa response can be identified in patients with Parkinson's disease; a transient short-duration response, a sustained long-duration response to exogenous levodopa, and diurnally varying endogenous levodopa synthesis. A pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic model was developed to describe the individual components of levodopa response. Twenty-one previously untreated (de novo) patients with Parkinson's disease and 12 patients who had received levodopa orally for 9.7 &#177; 4.0 years were investigated. Twenty de novo patients were examined at 6, 12, 24 and 48 months. No systematic changes in levodopa pharmacokinetics were found in the first 4 years of long-term levodopa treatment. A lowered baseline motor response and an increase in efficacy with time result in an exaggerated short-duration response which might be key contributors to the development of motor fluctuations with long-term levodopa treatment. The capability of CTS to generate typical responses was evaluated. If progression rate of bradykinesia is influenced by age then it should be possible to detect this effect using reasonable clinical trial designs. The ELLDOPA trial aims to determine if levodopa slows or accelerates the rate of disease progression of Parkinson's disease. The power of the ELLDOPA trial design was evaluated using a clinical pharmacology model. The simulation results suggested that the short washout period for levodopa symptomatic effect could lead to a false conclusion about the nature of the levodopa treatment effect. This thesis has shown that pharmacodynamic or disease progression factors rather than pharmacokinetic changes are responsible for the development of motor fluctuations in Parkinson's disease. It has quantified the unexpected development of increased efficacy of levodopa over time. Clinical trials designed to evaluate disease progression without recognising washout of the long-duration response of levodopa can lead to misinterpretation of trial outcomes. However, model based approaches can disentangle these confounding factors and dissect the underlying effects of drug action on disease progression.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::320500 Pharmacology and Pharmaceutical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/4266</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluation of an Online English learning program</field><field name="creator">Ho, Yi-Chieh</field><field name="description">Along with the rapid growth of computer technology, the need for CALL evaluation has become increasingly important; however, its implementation remains problematic for a number of reasons including teachers&#8217; lack of experience and adequate skills (Hubbard, 2006), lack of mutually agreed-upon adequate criteria (Hubbard, 2006), and lack of higher-level evaluative skills to evaluate media online (Oosterhof, Conrad, &amp; Ely, 2008). This study describes the classroom-based evaluation of a CALL program. It was undertaken in a Taiwan technological institute, with participants (N = 39) from second-year night-time junior college. The aims were to evaluate the effectiveness of the English Discoveries Online (EDO) program, to identify changes for more effective future use and sound criteria for CALL evaluation. The program&#8217;s key features include self-directed courses, self-access out of class, regularly updated materials delivered through the Internet, Web-literacy development, the Teacher Management System, and support tools. Effectiveness was determined by examining self-access learning out of class, motivation, Web-literacy, English proficiency, and the above key features. Both quantitative and qualitative methods were used. The evaluation followed Alderson&#8217;s (1992) framework for planning, Weir and Roberts (1994) for design and implementation, and Ellis&#8217; (1997a &amp; b) three types of evaluation for data collection. Instruments included: questionnaires, checklists, an observation record of student behaviors, a monitoring record of the computer screens, reports, individual student records on self-access, and student e-mails sent to the teacher-researcher. The results showed that students considered the EDO helpful for learning English, for enhancing their computer knowledge and English learning interest out of class. There was no significant change in students&#8217; motivation and Web-literacy. There was a significant improvement in students&#8217; pre- and post-test scores in reading and writing. More positive rather than negative comments were given about the key features of the program in students&#8217; reports. Overall, 91% of the class considered the program effective. The findings indicate that this program has a place in English teaching in this Taiwan context. Implications and limitations, as well as lessons learned as a teacher and an evaluator, are discussed.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/4300</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Neuronal changes in the cerebral cortex of human brain in Huntington&#8217;s Disease</field><field name="creator">Thu, Doris C. V.</field><field name="description">Huntington's disease (HD) is characterised by a major loss of neurons mainly in the basal ganglia but recent evidence by Macdonald and Halliday (2002) and others have shown that the cerebral cortex is also affected. In this study, neuronal changes in the primary motor cortex (Brodmann's area 4), primary sensory cortex (Brodmann's area 3), anterior cingulate cortex (Brodmann's area 24) and superior frontal cortex (Brodmann's area 8) were investigated in 16 HD cases and 15 age, sex and postmortem-delay matched normal cases. Immunohistochemical techniques and light microscopy were used to compare the pattern of neuronal loss between the normal and HD cortices. The total neuronal population (NeuN) and pyramidal subpopulation (SMI32) in a subvolume of specific Brodmann's areas were investigated using unbiased stereological counting techniques. The results demonstrated a marked neuronal reduction in these cortical regions in HD compared to normal cases, and this reduction was greater as the "striatal" neuropathological grade increased in the primary motor and primary sensory cortex. However, in the anterior cingulate and superior frontal cortex, marked reduction was also demonstrated in the early grade cases. Despite this, there is also a large variation in the pattern of cell loss between HD cases of the same neuropathological grade, prompting the hypothesis that other factors may be influencing the extent of cell degeneration. To investigate this, the HD cases in this study were grouped into "mainly motor", "mainly mood" and "mixed" symptomatology groups. The results have shown that regardless of their striatal neuropathological grade, the pattern of cell loss in the cerebral cortex is correlated to the various clinical symptomatologies of HD. Another major finding is the demonstration of marked dystrophic changes in the remaining pyramidal neurons in HD cortex, suggesting major ongoing neuronal dysfunction. In addition, cortical interneurons (calbindin, calretinin and parvalbumin) are also shown to be affected in HD. These overall findings, together with the demonstration that there is no statistically significant correlation between the extent of neuronal cell death in the cortex and the CAG expansion number in the HD IT15 gene, show that HD is a heterogeneous disease where the pattern of cell loss in the cerebral cortex is as variable as the pattern of symptomatology. These findings provide a major contribution to the scientific understanding of the pathogenesis of HD in the human brain.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/4265</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Therapeutic potential of neural progenitor cell transplantation in a rat model of Huntington&#8217;s Disease</field><field name="creator">Vazey, Elena Maria</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Neural progenitor cells</field><field name="subject">Cell transplantation</field><field name="subject">Huntington's disease</field><field name="subject">Lithium chloride</field><field name="subject">hESC</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/4484</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Quantitative continuity feature for preterm neonatal EEG signal analysis</field><field name="creator">Wong, Lisa, 1968-</field><field name="description">Electroencephalography (EEG) is an electrical signal recorded from a person's scalp, and is used to monitor the neurological state of the patient. This thesis proposes a quantified continuity feature to aid preterm neonatal EEG analysis. The continuity of EEG signals for preterm infants refers to the variation of the EEG amplitude, and is affected by the conceptional age of the infants. Currently, the continuity of the signal is determined largely by visual examination of the raw EEG signal, or by using general guidelines on amplitude-integrated EEG (aEEG), which is a compressed plot of the estimated signal envelope. The proposed parametric feature embodies the statistical distribution parameters of the signal amplitudes. The signal is first segmented into pseudo-stationary segments using Generalized Likelihood Ratio (GLR). These segments are used to construct a vector of amplitude, the distribution of which can be modelled using a log-normal distribution. The mean and standard deviation of the log-normal distribution are used as the continuity feature. This feature is less prone to the effects of local transient activities than the aEEG. This investigation has demonstrated that the degree of continuity corresponds to the major axis of the feature distribution in the feature space, and the minor axis roughly corresponds to the age of the infants in healthy files. Principal component analysis was performed on the feature, with the first coefficient used as a continuity index and the second coefficient as a maturation index. In this research, classifiers were developed to use the continuity feature to produce a qualitative continuity label. It was found that using a linear discriminant analysis based classifier, labelled data can be used as training data to produce labels consistent across all recordings. It was also found that unsupervised classifiers can assist in identifying the intrinsic clusters occurring in the recordings.  It was concluded that the proposed continuity feature can be used to aid further research in neonatal EEG analysis. Further work should focus on using the continuity information to provide a context for further feature extraction and analysis.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Signal Processing</field><field name="subject">EEG</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::291600 Computer Software</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/4532</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Women writing trauma : an analysis of psychological trauma in Ingeborg Bachmann's Das Buch Franza, Christa Wolf's Kassandra, Patricia Grace's Cousins, and Ngahuia Te Awekotuku's Ruahine - mythic women</field><field name="creator">Allport, Tanya</field><field name="description">This thesis seeks to explore how women express psychological trauma through the writing of fiction. By analysing the historical context of what psychological trauma has meant to women, and how they have represented it, the thesis proposes a model which is based on the recurrent sources of trauma for women, the &#8216;triple trauma&#8217; of othering, violence, and voicelessness. By using cross-cultural examples from the writing of Austrian Ingeborg Bachmann, German writer Christa Wolf, and the New Zealand M&#257;ori writers Patricia Grace and Ngahuia Te Awekotuku, questions are asked about the similarities and differences of how psychological trauma is represented through fiction, and what this means for the female protagonists of the texts, the female writers, readers and the cultures and societies out of which these writings originate. In analysing these relations, this thesis finds that the fictional writing about the sources and experiences of trauma can expose a range of ideological connections, and that the writing and reading about these connections constitutes a valid trauma discourse. This trauma discourse supports the aim of contemporary feminist traumatology which is to make women&#8217;s trauma visible, give meaning to it, and ultimately create frameworks that promote the healing (and prevention) of trauma.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/4527</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A methodology for business processes identification: developing instruments for an effective enterprise system project</field><field name="creator">Berkowitz, Zeev</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences::280100 Information Systems</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/4346</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Te Mana o Te Waimana Tuhoe history of the Tauranga valley</field><field name="creator">Sissons, Jeffrey</field><field name="description">This study is an interpretation of history related by T&#363;hoe historians of the Tauranga valley, a valley situated on the northern side of the Urewera ranges, North Island, New Zealand. It is also an interpretation of historical records relating to the Tauranga valley T&#363;hoe community. Fieldwork for the study was carried out between November 1977 and July 1978, and between November 1978 and May 1979. It is argued that T&#363;hoe history of the Tauranga valley comprises four separate, but connected, domains of discourse. The first domain considered includes narratives which link tribes and sub-tribes, and relate them to their land. The second concerns relationships between local wh&#257;nau, extended families descended from grand-parents of elders now living. Accounts which comprise the third domain focus upon the identity of Rua Kenana, a T&#363;hoe leader who, with his people the Iharaira (or Israelites), established a &#8216;city of God&#8217; at Maungap&#333;hatu (at the source of the Tauranga river). The fourth domain is that of reminiscence. Three Tauranga valley settlements are described by four Iharaira elders; Tataiahape between 1909 and 1915, Matah&#299; between 1915 and 1927, and T&#257;whana in the late 1920s and 1930s. In order to highlight and explore distinctions between T&#363;hoe history and Western history, T&#363;hoe accounts are not integrated with documentary sources into a single narrative. The focus is upon T&#363;hoe history and documents are drawn upon where relevant to an understanding of this history as a distinctive mode of discourse.</field><field name="date">1984</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370300 Anthropology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/4419</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A design framework and genetic algorithm for digital design optimisation on FPGAs</field><field name="creator">Savage, Matthew James Waipurukuma.</field><field name="description">Design tools of ever increasing power are required to keep pace with technological improvements in chip production. Chip capacities continually increase meaning that designs previously unfeasible become feasible. These designs are typically more complex and larger than their predecessors. Usually, the time available to a designer does not increase at the same rate. A designer is therefore tasked with a greater work load and a very limited amount of time. Design tools and automation are therefore necessary to compensate for this situation. The limiting characteristics of a design tool are its ease of use, the range of systems it can be applied to, and the quality of results obtained. Should a design tool lack in any of these three areas it will be of limited benefit. This work addresses only the quality of results obtained. While the other two are essential, they are unlikely to be relevant to a design tool if that tool is not adopted because the results were of insufficient quality. A design framework is proposed for the digital design of systems on FPGAs. This framework sets out the processes for producing a system specification of the design problem encountered, and then gives a procedure for processing that specification to produce a set of pareto-optimal designs in VHDL to implement the specification. The actual mapping of a specification to a VHDL design, is held in a mapping string that allows optimisation to be separated from other stages in the design framework. A new genetic algorithm, the Adaptive Speciation Genetic Algorithm (ASGA), is proposed featuring a customised selection, crossover, and mutation operator. This algorithm is assessed against other genetic algorithms from the literature on a knapsack problem and three digital design case studies. These case studies were the design of a parameter estimation circuit for a Self-Tuning Regulator (STR), the design of a Sum-of-Absolute- Difference (SAD) function for video motion detection problems, and the design of a five state Extended Kalman Filter (EKF). Results indicated that ASGA had good performance in all these problems. Through tests against other genetic algorithms, it was found the ASGA&#8217;s selection operator was inferior in some cases to that of the Pareto Envelope Selection Algorithm (PESA) by 3 Corne et al. By incorporating the selection operator of PESA performance improvements could be gained in the EKF problem.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">genetic algorithm</field><field name="subject">digital design</field><field name="subject">FPGA</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences::280200 Artificial Intelligence and Signal and Image Processing::280212 Neural networks, genetic algorithms and fuzzy logic</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/4523</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Involvement of the osteoblast in Paget's disease of bone</field><field name="creator">Matthews, Brya Grace</field><field name="description">Paget&#8217;s disease is characterised by focal regions of accelerated bone turnover. The aetiology is unknown, but genetic and environmental factors have been implicated. Pagetic lesions contain increased numbers of osteoclasts with abnormal morphology, so an osteoclast defect has been considered central to the pathogenesis. However, given osteoblasts regulate osteoclast differentiation and activity; osteoblast abnormalities may be important in the disease. This study aimed to identify features of pagetic osteoblasts that could clarify their role in Paget&#8217;s disease. Gene expression in osteoblasts and bone marrow cultured from pagetic lesions of 23 patients was compared to cells from unaffected tissue using both microarrays and real time RT-PCR. The results indicated global changes in gene expression in pagetic osteoblasts. A number of genes that can stimulate osteoclastogenesis, including interleukins 6 and 1&#946;, and monocyte chemotactic factor 1 were up-regulated, but the RANKL/OPG ratio tended to be decreased. Genes involved in osteoblast differentiation were down-regulated, including the transcription factors RUNX2, DLX5 and SATB2, the osteogenic factor BMP2, and the matrix proteins osteocalcin and bone sialoprotein. Markers of less mature osteoblastic cells, alkaline phosphatase and matrix gla protein were up-regulated. The intermediate filament, keratin 18, was very significantly up-regulated in pagetic cells. Over-expression of this protein in osteoblasts using an adenoviral vector produced some changes in gene expression, but did not produce an overtly pagetic phenotype. Over-expression of SQSTM1 mutants found in some patients with Paget&#8217;s disease also produced only minor changes in osteoblast phenotype. The RNA from the primary cell cultures was also used to investigate the presence of measles virus and somatic mutations in SQSTM1 in the disease, but neither were identified in any of the patients.  These results suggest that there are important changes in pagetic osteoblasts that are maintained when the cells are removed from the affected bone microenvironment. These include enhanced production of factors to stimulate osteoclastogenesis, while osteoblast differentiation and activity may be impaired. We were unable to identify genetic or environmental factors that could trigger these changes. The pagetic osteoblast is distinct from control cells, and is likely to contribute to the development of Paget&#8217;s disease.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Paget's disease</field><field name="subject">osteoblast</field><field name="subject">gene expression</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/4483</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Understanding and measuring flow in aortic stenosis with MRI</field><field name="creator">O'Brien, Kieran Robert</field><field name="description">In patients with aortic stenosis, accurate assessment of severity with echocardiography is central to surgical decision making. But, when image quality is poor or equivocal results obtained, another robust non-invasive technique would be invaluable. Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) may be a useful alternative. Phase contrast CMR can measure  ow and velocity, therefore it is theoretically possible to estimate the main determinant of severity aortic valve area, using the continuity approach. However, it was found that the phase contrast estimate of stroke volume, sampled in the stenotic jet, systematically underestimated left ventricular stroke volume. This underestimation was greater with increasing aortic stenosis severity. Critical clinical treatment decisions depend on the ability to reliably differentiate between patients with moderate and severe aortic stenosis. To achieve accurate estimation of aortic valve areas the velocity and  ow data obtained in these turbulent, high velocity jets must be accurate. In this thesis, non-stenotic and stenotic phantoms were designed and constructed to experimentally interrogate the error. It was determined that signal loss, due to intravoxel dephasing, decreased the reliability of the measured forward  ow jet velocities. Extreme signal loss in the jet eventuated in salt and pepper noise, which, with a mean velocity of zero, resulted in the underestimation. Intravoxel dephasing signal loss due to higher order motions, turbulence and spin mixing could all be mitigated by reducing the duration of the velocity sensitivity gradients and shortening the overall echo time (TE). However, improvements in an optimised PC sequence (TE 1:5ms) were not satisfactory. Flow estimates remained variable and were underestimated beyond the aortic valve. To reduce the TE further, a new phase contrast pulse sequence based on an ultrashort TE readout trajectory and velocity dependent slice excitation with gradient inversion was designed and implemented.

I argue that acts of M&#257;ori cultural survivance are manifested in the works of these three authors both internally, in terms of the actions of characters in their fictional narratives, and externally, by the authors themselves who fight for survivance in a literary publishing world that is often slow to recognize and value works of fiction that challenge traditional (Western) modes of novel form and style. Thesis chapters therefore include both extensive critical readings of Grace&#8217;s novel Dogside Story (2001), Morris&#8217;s novels Queen of Beauty (2002) and Hibiscus Coast (2005), and Morey&#8217;s novel Bloom (2003) as well as detailed biographical information based on my interviews with the authors themselves. The thesis emphasizes the ways in which each woman&#8217;s approach to writing survivance fiction is largely driven by her personal history and whakapapa. The study also asserts that Grace, Morris and Morey are producing acts of indigenous literary cultural survivance that &#8220;imagine the world healthy,&#8221; something author and critic Maxine Hong Kingston demands that contemporary writers of critical fictions must do if they are going to convince the book-buying populace &#8220;not to worship tragedy as the highest art anymore&#8221; (204). Grace, Morris, and Morey depict the creative, generative, and &#8220;healthy&#8221; aspects of M&#257;ori cultural survivance as taking place in both the real and imagined communities which they live in and write about. Their texts offer hope for the ongoing survival &#8211; and survivance &#8211; of M&#257;ori culture in the twenty-first century.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori Literature</field><field name="subject">New Zealand Literature</field><field name="subject">Women's Literature</field><field name="subject">Pacific Literature</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420200 Literature Studies::420203 Literatures of the Pacific</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420200 Literature Studies::420202 Maori literature</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/4528</field></doc><doc><field name="title">"At school I&#8217;ve got a chance...": social reproduction in a New Zealand secondary school</field><field name="creator">Jones, Alison</field><field name="description">This study contributes to the contemporary debate within Western radical sociology of education regarding the relationship between the social order and the processes of schooling. It is theoretically well-established in this field that schooling is central to the maintenance of existing social relations of dominance and subordination. Focusing on the commonsense knowledge and classroom practices of two groups of fifth form adolescent girls in an inner-city all-girls Grammar school in New Zealand, the study sets out to analyse and illustrate in concrete detail some of the ideological and pedagogical processes through which schooling contributes to social reproduction. The data and discussion provide insights into the thoughts and everyday school experiences of some middle class Pakeha (European) and working class Pacific Island girls as they seriously attempt to 'get school knowledge' and, thus, the credentials which they believe the school offers the motivated and able. It also shows how teachers unwittingly recruit the active participation of students from 'race' and class groups in pedagogical interactions which often preclude the working class Pacific Island girls from acquiring the school credentials they seek. This process, and that of the school's 'provision' of the middle class Pakeha girls' academic achievement, is then 'misrecognised' by the students as the natural and fair outcome of differential talent and motivation. The theoretical framework of the thesis centres around the major contemporary questions in social theory regarding the agency-structure relationship and how social and cultural life is to be conceptualised as the dialectical product of human agents producing and produced by the social structure within which they exist.</field><field name="date">1986</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/4479</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Feedback for learning: deconstructing teachers' conceptions and use of feedback</field><field name="creator">Dixon, Helen</field><field name="description">Cognisant of the critical interplay between beliefs and practice, the current study investigated primary school teachers' beliefs and understandings about feedback, and the use of feedback to enhance student learning. Central to the investigation has been an exploration of teachers' beliefs about the nature and place of feedback in student learning and of their role and that of learners in the feedback process. Of equal importance has been an examination of the strategies and practices that teachers utilised and ascribed importance to within the feedback process, including the opportunities offered to students in relation to the development of evaluative and productive knowledge and expertise (Sadler, 1989). To facilitate this investigation, Sadler's (1989) theory of formative assessment and feedback was used as a framework to inform both the research design and subsequent analyses. Utilising an interpretive, qualitative, case study methodology the current research was conducted in two sequential phases. Phase one consisted of semi-structured interviews with a convenience sample of 20 experienced teachers. In phase two, three of these 20 participants were selected purposively for classroom observations of teachers' feedback practice during the teaching of a written language unit. These teachers also participated in a semi-structured interview following each series of observations. During both phases, additional data were generated through field notes and the collection of relevant artefacts. Together, the multiple forms of evidence provided complementary information and ensured a rich pool of data. Three recognised approaches to data analysis were utilised, namely thematic analysis, the constant comparison method and discourse analysis. The use of Sadler's theoretical framework illuminated both similarities and differences among teachers in regard to the nature, place and role of feedback in learning and teaching. As teachers' feedback discourse was examined in more detail the influence of efficacy beliefs on the uptake and enactment of new ideas and practices associated with formative assessment and feedback became apparent. Teachers' beliefs about teaching and learning were a further mediating influence, particularly in regard to how the feedback process was conceived and with respect to the norms of behaviour that teachers promoted within the feedback process. The complexity of the beliefs/practice nexus was highlighted in regard to the influence of teachers' tacit, at times outmoded beliefs, on practice. Observations revealed that each of the three case study teachers had adopted many of the strategies associated with contemporary notions of good feedback practice. However, the ways in which these strategies were implemented in the classroom was a matter of considerable variation particularly in regard to the nature of student involvement and the amount of control maintained by the teacher. Findings from this phase of the research supported Fang's (1996) consistency/inconsistency thesis. In two of the three cases there was a high degree of consistency between teachers' stated intentions and their actions while in the third the opposite was apparent. Overall, it was concluded that while all teachers had adopted elements of the contemporary feedback 'discourse' none had mastered the 'Discourse' (Gee, 1996). Looking to the future, it is argued that this Discourse cannot be enacted through the mere bolting on of strategies to existing classroom programmes. To enact the contemporary Discourse in the ways imagined three conditions must be met. Firstly, beliefs about teaching, learning and feedback must reflect those embedded in the Discourse. Secondly, there must be a close alignment between those beliefs and practice. Thirdly, teachers must acquire in-depth subject matter knowledge, which will enable them to create the dialogic forms of feedback necessary for students to become self-monitoring and self-regulatory.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/4481</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Embedded Faith Journeys of Generations X and Y within New Zealand Church Communities</field><field name="creator">Johnstone, Carlton Graeme</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Generation X</field><field name="subject">Generation Y</field><field name="subject">Church</field><field name="subject">Faith Journeys</field><field name="subject">Church Switching</field><field name="subject">Church Two-Timing</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370100 Sociology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/4543</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Torrent of Portyngale: a critical edition</field><field name="creator">Montgomery, Keith David</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Middle English</field><field name="subject">Romance</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::410000 The Arts</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420200 Literature Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/4542</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The potential role of chemokines in redirecting progenitor cell migration into the lesioned striatum</field><field name="creator">Gordon, Rene&#769;e</field><field name="description">A number of studies have demonstrated directed migration of neural progenitor cells to sites of brain injury and disease. However, a detailed examination of when a cell is &#8220;born&#8221; in relation to injury induction and the migratory response of that cell has not previously been determined. This study therefore examined the temporal correlation between progenitor cell proliferation (&#8220;birth&#8221;) and neuroblast migratory response into the damaged striatum following quinolinic acid (QA) lesioning of the adult rat striatum. Retroviral labeling of subventricular zone (SVZ)&#8211;derived progenitor cells demonstrated that cell loss in the QA-lesioned striatum increased progenitor cell migration through the rostral migratory stream for up to 30 days. In addition, a population of dividing cells originating from the SVZ generated doublecortin positive neuroblasts that migrated into the damaged striatum in response to cell loss invoked by the QA lesion. The majority of doublecortin positive neuroblasts present in the damaged striatum were generated from progenitor cells dividing within two days prior to, or on the day of QA lesioning. In contrast, cells dividing two or more days following QA lesioning, migrated into the striatum and exhibited a glial phenotype. These results demonstrate that directed migration of SVZ-derived cells and neuroblast differentiation in response to QA lesioning of the striatum is acute and transient. We subsequently demonstrated a role for the chemokines MCP-1, MIP-1&#945; and GRO-&#945; in directing adult SVZ-derived progenitor cell migration following striatal cell death. MCP-1, MIP-1&#945; and GRO-&#945; were significantly upregulated in the striatum 2-3 days following QA-induced lesioning, correlating with maximum SVZ-derived progenitor cell recruitment into the lesioned striatum. We established that SVZ-derived progenitor cells express receptors for each chemokine, and demonstrated MCP-1, MIP-1&#945; and GRO-&#945; to be potent chemoattractants for SVZ-derived progenitor cells in vitro. Immunofluorescence revealed MCP-1, MIP-1&#945; and GRO-&#945; are predominantly expressed in the striatum by NG2-positive cells that appear to infiltrate from the bloodstream 6 hours following QA lesioning. These results indicate that upregulation of MCP-1, MIP-1&#945;, GRO-&#945; following striatal cell death leads to chemoattraction of SVZ-derived progenitor cells into the damaged striatum and raises a potential role for blood-derived cells in directing the recruitment of SVZ progenitor cells following brain injury.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::320500 Pharmacology and Pharmaceutical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/4538</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Antitumour efficacy of the nitroreductase-armed oncolytic adenovirus ONYX-411NTR in combination with dinitrobenzamide mustard prodrugs in preclinical models</field><field name="creator">Singleton, Dean Craig</field><field name="description">Oncolytic viruses that selectively replicate in and lyse cancer cells are a promising approach for the treatment of tumours that are resistant to conventional therapies. Clinical experience has shown that oncolytic viruses are safe and well tolerated but possess modest single agent activity. One approach to improve the efficacy of oncolytic viruses is to utilise their tumour tropism to deliver genes encoding enzymes able to activate prodrugs. ONYX-411 is an oncolytic adenovirus that replicates in cells that carry dysfunctions in the retinoblastoma (pRb) pathway, a common hallmark of cancer. ONYX-411 was &#8216;armed&#8217; by inserting the Escherichia coli nfsB nitroreductase (NTR) gene into the E3B region of the viral genome under the control of the endogenous E3 viral transcriptional machinery. NTR is an oxygen-insensitive nitroreductase that is capable of activating dinitrobenzamide mustard (DNBM) prodrugs to cytotoxic metabolites. The main objective of this thesis was to determine the extent and mechanism of the therapeutic interaction between ONYX-411NTR and DNBM prodrugs. A fluorogenic probe was developed to monitor NTR activity non-invasively and revealed robust, replication dependent NTR activity in ONYX-411NTR-infected neoplastic but not primary human cell lines. In vitro exposure of ONYX-411NTR-infected cells to therapeutically relevant concentrations of the DNBM prodrugs (SN 27686 or PR-104A) did not inhibit virus replication.  Tumour growth delay studies of systemic ONYX-411NTR followed by prodrug demonstrated different outcomes in three models (H1299, C33A, 22Rv1). To establish predictable viral infection of tumours a pre-infection model was developed using HCT 116 xenografts. This methodology demonstrated that prodrug administration (SN 28343 or PR-104) provided significant inhibition of tumour growth without suppression of ONYX-411NTR replication. Follow-on studies using intravenous virus administration confirmed titre amplification with time (24-fold between day 3 and 13 post administration; P &lt; 0.001) and a marked survival gain for the virus/prodrug combinations. Neither the prodrugs nor ONYX-411NTR were active as single agents. The improvement in efficacy for the combination of ONYX-411NTR and prodrug was conditional on NTR-dependent prodrug activation resulting in improved virus distribution within the tumour.  PR-104 is currently in clinical development making the combination of ONYX-411NTR with PR-104 a promising strategy for cancer selective therapy.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Oncolytic</field><field name="subject">Prodrug</field><field name="subject">Hypoxia</field><field name="subject">Gene therapy</field><field name="subject">Virus-directed enzyme-prodrug therapy</field><field name="subject">Gene-directed enzyme-prodrug therapy</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/4956</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Trace metal speciation in complex aquatic environments : the copper, cadmium, ferrihydrite, phthalic acid and bacterial system</field><field name="creator">Song, Yantao</field><field name="description">Trace metal speciation in aquatic environments is inherently complex due to the large number of possible interactions with dissolved and particulate components. Adsorption onto iron oxyhydroxide and bacterial surfaces, as well as the formation of metal-ligand complexes can play important roles in controlling the fate and transport of trace metals in natural environments. The objective of this study is to describe and understand metal speciation and distribution in a complex biogeochemical system by incrementally increasing the complexity from simple binary systems to a dynamic quaternary system containing a trace metal, iron oxide and bacteria that are active and metabolizing an organic ligand. Copper, cadmium, and phthalic acid (H2Lp) adsorption onto ferrihydrite in binary systems was well reproduced using the diffuse layer model (DLM). The adsorption of H2Lp adsorption was analogous to that of inorganic diprotic acids in terms of the relationship between the adsorption constants and acidity constants. In ternary systems H2Lp caused Cu2+ or Cd2+ adsorption to be either enhanced (due to surface ternary complex formation) or inhibited (due to solution complex formation) depending on the conditions. The DLM could only describe the effect of H2Lp on metal ion sorption by including ternary complexes of the form &#8801;FeOHMLp (0), where &#8801;FeOH is a surface site and M is Cu or Cd. The relationship between binary metal adsorption constants and the ternary complex adsorption constants from this and previous studies suggest several properties of ternary complexes. First, ternary complex structures on both ferrihydrite and goethite are either the same or similar. Second, those cations having large adsorption constants also have large equilibrium constants for ternary complex formation. Third, ligands forming stronger solution complexes with cations will also form stronger surface ternary complexes but because of the strong solution complexes these ligands will not necessarily enhance cation adsorption. The bacterial strain Comamonas spp. was isolated from the activated sludge of a wastewater treatment plant. Comamonas spp. could effectively degrade H2Lp in the presence of Cd2+ and ferrihydrite and was therefore chosen to study the effect of H2Lp degradation on Cd2+ speciation. Proton, cadmium and H2Lp adsorption onto Comamonas spp. were measured. The Comamonas spp. titration curve is flatter than that of ferrihydrite, indicating a higher degree of site heterogeneity at the bacterial surface. Adsorption edges of Cd2+ adsorption onto Comamonas spp. occurred over about 4~5 pH units compared to those of ferrihydrite which occurred over &#8776; 2 pH units on a dry weight basis. Comamonas spp. can accumulate a larger amount of Cd2+ than ferrihydrite especially under lower pH conditions. Proton and Cd2+ adsorption onto Comamonas spp. cells over a wide sorbent/sorbate and pH range was reasonably well described by a four site non-electrostatic model. The acid-base and Cd2+ adsorption behaviour of Comamonas spp. in this work were within the range of studies of bacteria adsorption. Phthalic acid adsorption onto inactive Comamonas spp. was negligible over a pH range of 3 to 8 and became significant only at pH &lt; 3 where H2Lp was fully protonated. This is consistent with the proposed mechanism for ligand adsorption onto bacterial surfaces which involved a balance between hydrophobic interaction and electrostatic repulsion. The presence of H2Lp decreased Cd2+ adsorption onto Comamonas spp. due to competition for Cd2+ between the bacterial cell surface and the formation of solution complexes of Cd2+. This was accurately modelled with the Cd-Lp solution species indicating that no significant surface ternary interaction occurred between Cd2+, phthalic acid and Comamonas spp.. Cadmium adsorption onto ferrihydrite-Comamonas spp. mixtures was slightly less than the simple additive predicted adsorption of ferrihydrite plus Comamonas spp.. This suggests there is a weak interaction between ferrihydrite and Comamonas spp. and this interaction could be modelled by including a generic reaction between the ferrihydrite and Comamonas spp. surface sites. Cadmium distribution in a system of inactive Comamonas spp.-ferrihydrite in the absence and presence of H2Lp could be predicted by combining the ferrihydrite and bacteria models with the inclusion of the ferrihydrite-bacteria interaction. The effects of H2Lp degradation on Cd2+ distribution were investigated in dynamic systems with live bacteria. Results showed that Cd2+ adsorption in these dynamic systems was reasonably estimated with the model parameters developed in the proceeding experiments though uncertainty exists in the dynamic process with regards to H2Lp biodegradation products and changes in the bacteria population. This thesis was therefore able to provide a better understanding of metal speciation in complex and heterogeneous realistic environments by experimentally examining and modelling metal speciation and distribution in various systems with increasing complexity. This helps to bridge the gap of quantitative description of metal speciation from simple laboratory experiment systems to real world systems, both natural and engineered.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Trace Metal; Bacteria; Ferrihydrite; Sorption</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5229</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cortical thinning and neuropsychological changes in presymptomatic Huntington's Disease</field><field name="creator">Davison, John W.</field><field name="description">Degeneration of the striatum and striatal-frontal circuits are generally thought to cause most of the neuropsychological symptoms experienced in Huntington&#8216;s Disease (HD). Advances in cortical thickness mapping (an automated MRI method for precisely measuring the cortical thickness across the entire cortex) provide a new technique for examining changes in the brain in HD. Recent studies using this technology have reported provocative results. They found significant cortical thinning in participants with early HD (Rosas et al., 2002; Rosas et al., 2008) and even in presymptomatic HD (Rosas et al., 2005). Moreover, cortical thinning was most prominent in posterior regions of the brain, with relative preservation of the anterior frontal regions. The present study replicated Rosas et al.&#8216;s (2005) study but used a larger sample of presymptomatic HD participants (n = 19) and a control group matched for age, gender and education (n = 19). Presymptomatic HD participants were divided into two groups, PreHDclose and PreHDfar, based on their estimated proximity to clinical onset. The distribution of cortical thinning was assessed using an identical MRI method to previous cortical thinning studies with HD participants. Specific neuropsychological tests were used to assess cognitive and mood changes that may be associated with cortical thinning. It was hypothesised that cortical thinning would be more evident in posterior than frontal cortical regions. It was also hypothesised that presymptomatic HD participants would perform more poorly than controls on tests that are subserved primarily by specific posterior cortical regions, but not on tests that are subserved by anterior cortical regions. Lastly, it was predicted that poorer performance in the neuropsychological measures would be associated with greater thinning in cortical regions that are important during performance of these tasks. Consistent with predictions, the presymptomatic HD group showed regionally-specific cortical thinning which was most prominent in the posterior cortices, particularly around the right parieto-temporal-occipital (PTO) junction. Thinning occurred in people up to 15 years before clinical onset, with little to no thinning before that. The presymptomatic HD group, and particularly the PreHDclose participants, performed significantly worse than controls in 2 of the 6 cognitive tests that are subserved primarily by posterior cortical regions (the Judgment of Line iii Orientation test and modified Roadmap Test), but not in tests that are subserved primarily by frontal cortical regions. Correlational analyses showed a number of regionally-specific relationships between thinning and cognitive performance, although the distribution of these relationships did not generally support our region-of-interest predictions. The results contribute to a better characterisation of the cortical and neuropsychological changes that occur early in the development of HD, and provide tentative support for cortical thickness mapping as a valid and sensitive measure for assessing cortical changes in presymptomatic HD.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cortex</field><field name="subject">Neuropsychology</field><field name="subject">Huntington's disease</field><field name="subject">Cognitive</field><field name="subject">Cognition</field><field name="subject">HD</field><field name="subject">Dementia</field><field name="subject">MRI</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::220000 Social Sciences, Humanities and Arts-General</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/4955</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The management of children's asthma in primary care : Are there ethnic differences in care?</field><field name="creator">Crengle, Suzanne Marie</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted until August 2010, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Ethnic disparities</field><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">Pacific</field><field name="subject">Children</field><field name="subject">Asthma</field><field name="subject">Primary care</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Health services research</field><field name="subject">Kaupapa Maori Research</field><field name="subject">Quality of care</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321000 Clinical Sciences::321019 Paediatrics</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321200 Public Health and Health Services::321208 Primary health care</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321200 Public Health and Health Services::321207 Indigenous health</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321200 Public Health and Health Services::321210 Community child health</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321200 Public Health and Health Services::321202 Epidemiology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/4957</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The mechanism of washback on teaching and learning</field><field name="creator">Mizutani, Satomi</field><field name="description">The current research investigated the mechanism of the phenomenon known as washback (i.e., the impact of assessment on teaching and learning) in the context of a new national standards-based assessment system in New Zealand, particularly focusing on the area of the teaching and learning of Japanese as a foreign language. The National Certificate of Educational Achievement (NCEA) was progressively implemented across all subjects in the final three years of secondary schooling from 2002. It replaced norm-referenced assessments and aimed to function as assessment for learning as well as of learning. The research consisted of three studies. Studies One and Two investigated washback effects of NCEA as perceived by teachers and students of Japanese, and beliefs about NCEA which contributed to the washback effects. Participants claimed that the majority of the intended positive washback effects were promoted by the assessment, but the nature of the washback depended on beliefs about NCEA held by teachers and students. Students tended to report more negative washback of NCEA than did teachers. Study Three explored the role that contextual factors (e.g., subject, gender) and beliefs might play in mediating washback. This large-scale study involved teachers and students of Japanese, French, History, and Mathematics. Teacher and Student Questionnaires were developed to investigate washback of NCEA and beliefs about NCEA, Teaching, Learning, and Teacher Efficacy as well as to collect relevant background information on the participants. The study revealed that some contextual factors played a role in mediating certain types of beliefs and washback effects. The results also confirmed the crucial role that beliefs play in mediating washback, indicating that positive washback was promoted when participants&#8217; beliefs were in line with the intentions of the assessment. It is concluded that for educational reform through assessment change to be successful, stake holders&#8217; beliefs about the role of assessment may need to be altered. A model is presented to describe the mechanism of washback, showing how washback could be mediated directly and indirectly by contextual factors and beliefs.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/4545</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Regulation of stem cell development by Runx transcription factors</field><field name="creator">Lam, Enid Yi Ni</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Runx</field><field name="subject">zebrafish</field><field name="subject">transgenic</field><field name="subject">haematopiesis</field><field name="subject">stem cells</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/4961</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Unintentional falls at home among young and middle-aged adults: the influence of alcohol</field><field name="creator">Kool, Bridget</field><field name="description">Aim To investigate the epidemiology of unintentional fall-related injuries at home among young and middle-aged adults (25 to 59 years) and to investigate the contribution of alcohol to these injuries. Methods Routinely collected national fall injury data were analysed to describe the incidence and characteristics of falls at home resulting in death or hospital inpatient treatment among this age group in New Zealand. A systematic review of the published literature evaluated the epidemiological evidence quantifying the risk of falls associated with acute and usual alcohol consumption in this age group. A population-based case-control study was conducted in Auckland, New Zealand over a 12-month period. Cases were 335 people aged 25 to 59 years who were admitted to hospital or died as a result of unintentional non-occupational falls at home. Controls were 352 people randomly selected from the electoral roll from the same age group as the cases. The participants or next-of-kin completed a structured interview to ascertain data on personal and lifestyle factors including alcohol consumption. Findings The review of national injury data found that almost a third of unintentional falls resulting in an in-patient admission among working-age people were recorded as occurring at home. For every death there were about 150 in-patient hospital admissions. The systematic review identified only a small number of studies but showed an increased risk of unintentional falls in this age group with increasing exposure to alcohol use. The magnitude of this risk varied considerably across studies with most estimates being relatively imprecise. There was modest evidence of a dose-response relationship with acute alcohol use. The association between usual alcohol use and fall risk was inconclusive. The case-control study revealed that after controlling for confounding, the consumption of two or more standard alcoholic drinks in the preceding six hours relative to none is associated with a significantly increased risk of fall-related injury. Approximately 21% of unintentional non-occupational falls at home in this population was attributed to this risk. No association between hazardous drinking as a usual pattern and falls was found when the analyses were adjusted for confounders. Conclusion A significant proportion of unintentional fall-related injuries among the working-aged New Zealanders occur at home. Consuming two or more drinks in the previous six hours was strongly associated with unintentional non-occupational falls at home that result in admission to hospital or death in this age group. This largely unrecognised problem should be addressed in further research and in falls prevention programmes.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Accidental falls</field><field name="subject">alcohol, drinking</field><field name="subject">accidents, home</field><field name="subject">injury</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/4960</field></doc><doc><field name="title">New control strategy for CNC machines via STEP-NC</field><field name="creator">Wang, Hongqiang</field><field name="description">The contemporary product design and manufacturing environment requires a bidirectional and seamless data flow throughout all stages of data transactions. The establishment of STEP (STandard for Exchange of Product data) offers manufacturers a new method to exchange product data in the entire product life cycle. As an extension to STEP, STEP-NC provides the potential to finally close the gap between design and manufacturing in the drive for a complete, integrated product development environment. The STEP-NC data model is a long overdue improvement in the domain of computer numerical controls (CNC) where G-codes have been in use for more than half a century. STEP-NC brings richer information to CNCs presenting an opportunity for the development of more intelligent, interoperable and informative machining. The research work documented in this thesis introduces a fully STEP-compliant CNC system with an aim to solve the problems faced by the current CNC systems, e.g. disconnection with the upper-stream activities. The research is based on the premise that a STEP-NC program can document &#8220;generic&#8221; manufacturing information (whatto- do). This way, a STEP-NC program can be made machine-independent and has an advantage over the conventional G-code based NC program that is always generated for a specific CNC machine. The core of the STEP-compliant CNC system is the mapping mechanism which accepts STEP-NC data and translates it into the type of G-code that a specific controller can understand. The STEP-compliant CNC system has two principal elements, a STEP-NC Adapter and a STEP-NC Converter. The STEP-NC Adapter takes a generic STEP-NC program as its input and produces a more specific version of the STEP-NC program by &#8220;adapting&#8221; it to a local manufacturing environment and capabilities. This native STEP-NC file is a localised version of the generic STEP-NC file. It may be re-adapted to another manufacturing environment. The STEP-NC converter takes a native STEP-NC file and converts it to the required machine control data, i.e. G-codes that are ready to be loaded to the targeted CNC controller. The conversion process is also called a mapping or translating process that utilises the manufacturing environment databases developed for specific machine tools, or rather CNC controllers. The use of function block (IEC 61499) technology gives the system robustness and modularity. The STEP-NC adapter and converter are so developed that they can be embedded into a future CNC controller, making it a STEP-NC enabled controller. The system offers ample benefits to the CNC users by providing an interface for the STEP-NC data that carries rich information and the interface itself is also more userfriendly. It realises a long-awaited paradigm of common interface for CNC machine tools. With this system in place, one generic STEP-NC program can be made to drive different CNC machine tools, making NC programs portable and universally compatible. This system supports the scenario of &#8220;design anywhere and build anywhere&#8221;.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290500 Mechanical and Industrial Engineering::290501 Mechanical engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5228</field></doc><doc><field name="title">How do people manage their documents?: an empirical investigation into personal document management practices among knowledge workers</field><field name="creator">Henderson, Sarah</field><field name="description">Personal document management is the activity of managing a collection of digital documents performed by the owner of the documents, and consists of creation/acquisition, organisation, finding and maintenance.  Document management is a pervasive aspect of digital work, but has received relatively little attention from researchers. The hierarchical file system used by most people to manage their documents has not conceptually changed in decades.  Although revolutionary prototypes have been developed, these have not been grounded in a thorough understanding of document management behaviour and therefore have not resulted in significant changes to document management interfaces.  Improvements in understanding document management can result in productivity gains for knowledge workers, and since document management is such a common activity, small improvements can deliver large gains. The aim of this research was to understand how people manage their personal document collections and to develop guidelines for the development of tools to support personal document management. A field study was conducted that included interviews, a survey and file system snapshot.  The interviews were conducted with ten participants to investigate their document management strategies, structures and struggles.  In addition to qualitative analysis of semi-structured interviews, a novel investigation technique was developed in the form of a file system snapshot which collects information about document structures and derives a number of metrics which describe the document structure.  A survey was also conducted, consisting of a questionnaire and a file system snapshot, which enabled the findings of the field study to be validated, and to collect information from a greater number of participants.  The results of this research culminated in (1) development of a conceptual framework highlighting the key personal document management  attitudes, behaviours and concerns; (2) model of basic operations that any document management system needs to provide; (3) identification of piling, filing and structuring as three key document management strategies; (4) guidelines for the development of user interfaces to support document management, including specific guidelines for each document management strategy.  These contributions both improve knowledge of personal document management on which future research can build, and provide practical advice to document management system designers which should result in the development of more usable system.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">personal document management</field><field name="subject">document management</field><field name="subject">personal information management</field><field name="subject">information systems</field><field name="subject">human-computer interaction</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5230</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigation of New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc Wine  Using Trained Sensory Panels</field><field name="creator">Lund, Cynthia M.</field><field name="description">ABSTRACT  A core tool of sensory science is the use of trained descriptive panels.  This research describes an investigation into the role of motivation in the performance of trained panels and the use of a trained panel to develop a better understanding of the perception of Sauvignon blanc wines. Substantial investment in time and money is directed towards ensuring trained panels perform optimally.  Having selected a panel, the panel leader needs to ensure that panellists provide accurate, reliable data.  Panellist motivation is also an important factor to consider.  While performance psychology, education and sport science fields have researched motivation extensively, knowledge about panellist motivation within sensory science is limited.  However, findings from existing research in these other areas - which suggest an important role for autonomy, competence and relatedness - can be applied to sensory panels in order to increase intrinsic motivation. The initial part of the research investigated the fundamental factors that affect and influence panellists&#8217; motivation and participation.  A survey (n=74) revealed that extra income and a general interest in food were the key drivers in inspiring people to become panellists, whilst enjoyment in being a panellist, interest in food, and extra income were key drivers for people to remain panellists.  In a second survey, the intrinsic motivation of seven trained panels from four countries (n=108) was assessed.  External panels were found to be more intrinsically motivated than internal panels.  Experienced panellists had an increased perception of competence, which is a key factor for people to be intrinsically motivated.  Understanding motivational frameworks currently used in other research fields and integrating them into existing panel training protocols may enhance and sustain panellists&#8217; intrinsic motivation. A trained panel (n=14) was then used in the second part of the thesis to identify key flavours in Sauvignon blanc wines from Australia, France, New Zealand, Spain, South Africa and USA.  Sixteen characteristics were identified and measured, including sweet sweaty passionfruit, capsicum, passionfruit skin/stalk, boxwood/cat&#8217;s urine, grassy, mineral/flinty, citrus, bourbon, apple lolly/candy, tropical, mint, fresh asparagus, canned asparagus, stonefruit, apple and snowpea. Principal component analysis was used to describe differences between regions and countries.  Sauvignon blanc wines from Marlborough, New Zealand (NZ), were described by tropical and sweet sweaty passionfruit characteristics, while French and South African Sauvignon blanc wines were described as having flinty/mineral and bourbon-like flavors.  Chemical analyses of these wines also showed that Marlborough, NZ wines had more methoxypyrazine and thiol compounds.  A consumer study (n=109) showed that New Zealanders significantly prefer New Zealand style Sauvignon blanc. The final part of this research focused on using trained panellists to explore the interactions between volatile and non-volatile wine compounds and their effects on the aroma profile of New Zealand Sauvignon blanc wine.  Four volatile aroma compounds that are important in New Zealand Sauvignon blanc wine were studied (isobutyl methoxypyrazine [MIBP], 3-mercaptohexanol [3MH], 3-mercaptohexanol acetate [3MHA], and ethyl decanoate).  Each of these four aroma compounds were assessed in combination with three non-volatile polyphenolic compounds commonly found in Sauvignon blanc wine: catechin, caffeic acid and quercetin.  Results showed each polyphenol had a unique effect when blended with a specific aroma compound, either suppressing, accentuating, or showing little effect on the perception of the aroma compounds.  The perception of MIBP, 3MH, and ethyl decanoate were largely suppressed by the added polyphenols, with a few exceptions.  The perception of 3MH was accentuated with the addition of caffeic acid, and the perception of 3MHA was accentuated with the addition of catechin.  The interactive effects of aroma compounds with polyphenols likely reflect non-covalent associations in the wine solution that reduce the volatility of the aroma compounds.  With an understanding of the interactive effects of volatile and non-volatile compounds in wine, winemakers might optimize the impact of selected volatile compounds by managing polyphenol levels, supporting their efforts to attain desirable wine aroma profiles.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sauvignon blanc wine</field><field name="subject">trained panel</field><field name="subject">sensory analysis</field><field name="subject">motivation</field><field name="subject">region</field><field name="subject">consumer</field><field name="subject">thiols</field><field name="subject">methoxy pyrazines</field><field name="subject">perception</field><field name="subject">volatiles</field><field name="subject">non volatiles</field><field name="subject">polyphenols</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5168</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Getting evidence to and from general practice consultations for cardiovascular risk management using computerised decision support</field><field name="creator">Wells, Linda Susan Mary</field><field name="description">Abstract Background Cardiovascular disease (CVD) has an enormous impact on the lives and health of New Zealanders. There is substantial epidemiological evidence that supports identifying people at high risk of CVD and treating them with lifestyle and drug-based interventions. If fully implemented, this targeted high risk approach could reduce future CVD events by over 50%. Recent studies have shown that a formal CVD risk assessment to the systematically identify high risk patients is rarely done in routine New Zealand general practice and audits of CVD risk management have shown large evidence-practice gaps. The CVD risk prediction score recommended by New Zealand guidelines for identifying high CVD risk patients was derived from the US Framingham Heart Study using data collected between the 1960s and 1980s. This score has only modest prediction accuracy and there are particular concerns about it&#8217;s validity for New Zealand sub-populations such as high risk ethnic groups or people with diabetes. Aims The overall aims of this thesis were to investigate the potential of a computerised decision support system (CDSS) to improve the assessment and management of CVD risk in New Zealand general practice while simultaneously developing a sustainable cohort study that could be used for validating and improving CVD risk prediction scores and related research. Methods An environmental scan of the New Zealand health care setting&#8217;s readiness to support a CDSS was conducted .The epidemiological evidence was reviewed to assess the effect of decision support systems on the quality of health care and the types and functionality of systems most likely to be successful. This was followed by a focused systematic review of randomised trials evaluating the impact of CDSS on CVD risk assessment and management practices and patient CVD outcomes in primary care. A web-based CDSS (PREDICT) was collaboratively developed. This rules-based provider-initiated system with audit and feedback and referral functionalities was fully integrated with general practice electronic medical records in a number of primary health organisations (PHOs). The evidence-based content was derived from national CVD and diabetes guidelines. When clinicians used PREDICT at the time of a consultation, treatment recommendations tailored to the patient&#8217;s CVD and diabetes risk profile were delivered to support decision-making within seconds. Simultaneously, the patient&#8217;s CVD risk profiles were securely stored on a central server. With PHO permission, anonymised patient data were linked via encrypted patient National Health Index numbers to national death and hospitalisation data. Three analytical studies using these data are described in this thesis. The first evaluated changes in GP risk assessment practice following implementation of PREDICT; the second investigated patterns of use of the CDSS by GPs and practice nurses; and the third describes the emerging PREDICT cohort and a preliminary validation of risk prediction scores. Results Given the rapid development of organised primary care since the 1990&#8217;s, the high degree of general practice computerisation and the New Zealand policy (health, informatics, privacy) environment, the introduction of a CDSS into the primary care setting was deemed feasible. The evidence for the impact of CDSS in general has been moderately favourable in terms of improving desired practice. Of the randomised trials of CDSS for assessing or managing CVD risk, about two-thirds reported improvements in provider processes and two-fifths reported some improvements in intermediate patient outcomes. No adverse effects were reported. Since 2002, the PREDICT CDSS has been implemented progressively in PHOs within Northland and the three Auckland regional District Health Board catchments, covering a population of 1.5 million. A before-after audit conducted in three large PHOs showed that CVD risk documentation increased four fold after the implementation of PREDICT. To date, the PREDICT dataset includes around 63,000 risk assessments conducted on a cohort of over 48,000 people by over 1000 general practitioners and practice nurses. This cohort has been followed from baseline for a median of 2.12 years. During that time 2655 people died or were hospitalised with a CVD event. Analyses showed that the original Framingham risk score was reasonably well calibrated overall but underestimated risk in high risk ethnic groups. Discrimination was only modest (AUC 0.701). An adjusted Framingham score, recommended by the New Zealand Guideline Group (NZGG) overestimated 5-year event rates by around 4-7%, in effect lowering the threshold for drug therapy to about 10% 5-year predicted CVD risk. The NZGG adjusted score (AUC 0.676) was less discriminating than the Framingham score and over-adjusted for high risk ethnic groups. For the cohort aged 30-74 years, the NZGG-recommended CVD risk management strategy identified almost half of the population as eligible for lifestyle management +/- drug therapy and this group generated 82% of all CVD events. In contrast the original Framingham score classified less than one-third of the cohort as eligible for individualised management and this group generated 71% of the events that occurred during follow-up. Implications This research project has demonstrated that a CDSS tool can be successfully implemented on a large scale in New Zealand general practice. It has assisted practitioners to improve the assessment and management of CVD at the time of patient consultation. Simultaneously, PREDICT has cost-effectively generated one of the largest cohorts of M&#257;ori and non-M&#257;ori ever assembled in New Zealand. As the cohort grows, new CVD risk prediction scores will be able to be developed for many New Zealand sub-populations. It will also provide clinicians and policy makers with the information needed to determine the trade-offs between the resources required to manage increasing proportions of the populations and the likely impact of management on preventing CVD events.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">decision support system</field><field name="subject">cardiovascular disease</field><field name="subject">family practice</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321200 Public Health and Health Services::321202 Epidemiology</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences::280100 Information Systems::280109 Decision support and group support systems</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::320100 Medicine-General</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::320100 Medicine-General</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/4959</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The performance of DS-CDMA cellular systems with variable-bit-rate traffic</field><field name="creator">Sowden, Bradley Claude</field><field name="description">The deployment of third generation (3G) cellular systems is resulting in a transition from cellular systems that predominantly carry constant-bit-rate (CBR) voice traffic to multi-service packet based systems that predominantly carry variable-bit-rate (VBR) traffic. With 3G DS-CDMA cellular systems there is a direct relationship between user traffic and propagation dependent performance as additional traffic causes increased system interference. This thesis investigates the impact of VBR traffic on the propagation dependent performance of DS-CDMA cellular systems that utilise frame-by-frame dynamic resource allocation on the radio channel. A DS-CDMA cellular system model is developed and the downlink performance of both outdoor macro-cellular and indoor pico-cellular systems is evaluated with a variety of traffic types. Both traffic scheduling performance and propagation dependent performance are evaluated as the two are inter-linked. Scenarios are identified where propagation dependent performance is sensitive to the statistical properties of the user traffic streams and it is shown that a significant performance difference potentially exists between different traffic types when the number of users per cell is low. When a significant performance difference does exist, burstier more variable traffic generally results in superior propagation dependent performance. The base transceiver station (BTS) transmitter power mean and variance provides a good indication of the level of propagation dependent performance regardless of the specific traffic type. Traffic scheduling policies that deliberately reduce the variability of user traffic streams are considered and in terms of propagation dependent performance these are shown to have a minimal impact on the performance difference between different traffic types. The implications of VBR traffic on DS-CDMA cellular system design are outlined and it is shown that VBR traffic can be approximated as CBR traffic in many scenarios and this is a convenient approximation as it simplifies system design and detailed traffic models do not need to be developed.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290900 Electrical and Electronic Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5211</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Regulation of anthocyanin accumulation in apple by the transcription factor MdMYB10</field><field name="creator">Espley, Richard V.</field><field name="description">Anthocyanin concentration is an important determinant of the colour of many fruits. In apple (Malus x domestica), centuries of breeding have produced numerous varieties in which levels of anthocyanin pigment vary widely and change differently in response to environmental and developmental stimuli. The apple fruit cortex is usually colourless, although germplasm does exist where the cortex is highly pigmented due to the accumulation of anthocyanins, carotenoids or chlorophylls. From studies in a diverse array of plants species, it is apparent that anthocyanin biosynthesis is controlled at the level of transcription. In this thesis the transcript levels of the anthocyanin biosynthetic genes in a red-fleshed apple are compared with a white-fleshed cultivar. A MYB transcription factor (TF), MdMYB10, was isolated and is shown to be similar in sequence to known anthocyanin regulators in other species. Further, this TF is shown to induce anthocyanin accumulation in both heterologous and homologous systems, generating pigmented patches in transient assays in tobacco leaves and highly pigmented apple plants following stable transformation with constitutively expressed MdMYB10. Efficient induction of anthocyanin biosynthesis in transient assays by MdMYB10 was dependent on the co-expression of two bHLH proteins from apple, MdbHLH3 and MdbHLH33. A strong correlation between expression of MdMYB10 and apple anthocyanin levels during fruit development suggests that this TF is responsible for controlling anthocyanin biosynthesis in apple fruit; in the red-fleshed cultivar and in the skin of other varieties, there is an induction of MdMYB10 expression concurrent with colour formation during development. Mutations in the genes encoding for either the biosynthetic or transcriptional regulation of the anthocyanin pathway have been linked to colour phenotypes. Generally this is a loss of function resulting in a reduction or a change in the distribution of anthocyanin. The upstream regulatory region of MdMYB10 was investigated and found to contain a rearrangement. This modification is responsible for increasing the level of anthocyanin throughout the plant to produce a striking phenotype that includes red foliage and red fruit flesh. It consists of a series of multiple repeats, forming a minisatellite-like structure that comprises five direct tandem repeats of a 23 base pair sequence. This MdMYB10 rearrangement is present in all the red foliage apple varieties and species tested, but in none of the white fleshed varieties. Transient assays demonstrated that the 23 bp sequence motif is a target of the MdMYB10 protein itself, and the number of repeat units correlates with an increase in transactivation by MdMYB10 protein. The repeat motif is capable of binding MdMYB10 protein in electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Taken together, these results indicate that a rearrangement in the promoter of MdMYB10 has generated an autoregulatory locus and this autoregulation is sufficient to account for the increase in MdMYB10 transcript levels and subsequent ectopic accumulation of anthocyanins throughout the plant. Characterisation of MdMYB10 and the rearrangement in the promoter region has implications for the development of new varieties through classical breeding or a biotechnological approach. Understanding whether this mutation is simply an allele of other recently published apple MYB TFs, or if this is the only R2R3 MYB TF involved in apple anthocyanin response, is a challenge for future research.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5170</field></doc><doc><field name="title">You bet your life...and mine!  Contemporary Samoan gambling in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Perese, Lana</field><field name="description">Pacific peoples in New Zealand are identified as having the highest risk and prevalence of problem and pathological gambling behaviours.  Despite increasing awareness of gambling related harms in New Zealand there is a dearth of research on Pacific gambling, the reasons for problem gambling and the risks gambling poses for these populations. This thesis examines contemporary Samoan gambling and problem gambling through the perceptions and in-depth understandings of thirty-two Samoan participants.  Pacific research methodologies premised on Pacific epistemologies, practices and protocols provide the cultural framework that supports the qualitative methods used in this research.  These cultural methodologies also provide the context within which data gathered is analysed, interpreted and discussed.  The method used within this thesis is an amalgam of Pacific and grounded theory approaches. The research identifies Samoan cultural factors that play a major role in understanding contemporary Samoan gambling.  It links the deep-rooted cultural understandings of va/teu le va that are associated with early Samoan games and sports with contemporary Samoan gambling behaviours and practices.  The research provides cultural understandings of the complex conditions and processes within which contemporary Samoan gambling and problem gambling are embedded, constituted and differentiated for Samoan people in New Zealand.  These understandings are used to explore the extent to which gambling impacts harm Samoan individuals, families and communities.  The research also describes cultural factors that are associated with motivations for contemporary Samoan gambling. It demonstrates that concepts such as &#8216;winning&#8217;, &#8216;fundraising&#8217; and &#8216;socialising&#8217; act as primary motivations for engagement and explores ways in which these drivers challenge the va and teu le va that are inherent within fa&#8217;aSamoa. The potency of these new motivations is illustrated through consideration of cultural practices such as fa&#8217;alavelave, status acquisition, religion and hospitality.  These factors are not only complex but they also play an important role in the initiation, development and maintenance of Samoan gambling.   This thesis articulates a broad knowledge base of cultural factors, practices, influences and understandings that are associated with contemporary Samoan gambling in New Zealand.  It highlights how Samoan (problem) gambling while often rationalised in terms of aiga enhancing precepts is in reality most often undermining and eroding of aiga values and practices. In light of these findings, contextually effective Samoan solutions incorporated into Public Health interventions are recommended as a means of addressing the alarming gambling-related issues facing Samoan people in New Zealand.   A greater emphasis on aiga/familial interventions rather than focusing on individuals is crucial since aiga and close social networks are identified as playing an important role in the development and maintenance of gambling behaviour and can also be effective catalysts and supports for behavioural change.  Further research is indicated to better understand and develop the knowledge-base on contemporary Samoan gambling with specific relevance to Samoan youth and adult populations in New Zealand.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Samoan Gambling</field><field name="subject">Pacific epistemologies</field><field name="subject">Samoan epistemologies</field><field name="subject">Samoan Problem Gambling</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/4958</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Toward empirical IP host traffic measurement in passive network measurement</field><field name="creator">Lee, Dong Jin</field><field name="description">An IP flow represents a group of packets that share the same attribute such as their source address. The ever-growing network traffic produces an enormous number of flows. Recent studies attempt to simplify and mine flows in order to understand the network&#8217;s behaviour. The traditional technique of packet aggregation to 5-tuple flows provides understanding of the flows themselves, but fails to capture an understanding of the aggregated end-point that generates flows: the IP host. This thesis describes the design, development and analysis of a measurement method that identifies an IP host from network traffic. A conceptual model of IP host aggregations has been designed to summarize traffic: from 5-tuple to 2-tuple and finally to 1-tuple IP host. Using the framework, various observations and analyses have been conducted at the host level, including empirical distributions and behaviour relationships. Several host characteristics and applications are examined from real-world network data, such as characterizing host interaction variability and identifying hosts that are potentially significant.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5237</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mechanisms underlying hypoxic ischemic injury to the developing brain: The significance of matrix metalloproteinase 2 and 9</field><field name="creator">Ranasinghe, Himani Sumudumalee</field><field name="description">Perinatal hypoxic ischemic (HI) injury is a leading cause of long-term neurological complications in newborn babies. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are a family of endopeptidases that are capable of degrading the extracellular matrix (ECM) components. They are considered to be integral in many physiological processes.  However, recently it has been demonstrated that the inappropriate activity of these proteases, particularly MMP-2 and 9, contribute to the pathogenesis of cerebral ischemia in the adult brain. Given that ECM disruption is frequently observed following injury to the developing brain, it is possible that MMPs play an important role in HI injury processes in the developing brain. Therefore, this thesis evaluated the hypothesis that MMP-2 and 9 participate in the pathophysiology of HI injury to the developing brain. Since ECM remodelling is a fundamental process during brain development it was important to first characterise the MMP-2 and 9 profiles in the normal developing forebrain. We demonstrated that MMP-2, which mainly was observed in cortical plate neurons, declined with age, thus indicating a potential role in the development and differentiation of the cortical plate. Conversely, MMP-9 was increased with age, particularly during active myelination, indicating that it may contribute in myelination. Secondly, we showed an upregulation of MMP-9 within the ischemic core during the early hours following HI injury, suggesting that MMP-9 may be involved in the development of delayed injury processes following hypoxic ischemia. On the contrary, MMP-2 was strongly upregulated during a later stage following injury surrounding the ischemic core possibly suggesting that it plays a role in wound repair processes. Thirdly, the profiles of tissue (tPA) and urokinase (uPA) plasminogen activators were characterised following HI injury since they are known to be major upstream activators of MMPs. uPA upregulation paralleled that of MMP-2 suggesting a function for uPA in wound repair processes following HI injury to the developing brain through activation of MMP-2. In contrast with uPA, tPA activity remained unaffected following injury at both ages. Finally, MMP-9 activity was inhibited using a very specific MMP-2/9 inhibitor, SB-3CT, to determine if the MMP-9 deficiency protects the developing brain from HI injury. The elevated MMP-9 activity following HI injury was attenuated by the SB-3CT treatment. Although SB-3CT failed to confer any significant neuroprotection, we recommend that further investigations are needed before discounting the role of MMP-9 during HI injury to the developing brain. In conclusion, we suggest that MMP-9 is induced following an insult to the developing brain potentially contributing to the delayed neuronal death whilst MMP-2 is involved in essential developmental, differentiation and wound repair processes.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Brain</field><field name="subject">Ischemia</field><field name="subject">Hypoxia</field><field name="subject">Injury</field><field name="subject">Developmental</field><field name="subject">MMP-9</field><field name="subject">MMP-2</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/4962</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Visions of madness: an investigation into cinematic representations of unreason</field><field name="creator">Manley, Dean</field><field name="description">Madness is often associated with violence, criminality, and degenerative human failure in stigmatising media reports, and these are most people&#8217;s site of information about madness. Despite (or maybe because of) reductions in stigmatising reporting,  negative perceptions of madness persist, notwithstanding stringent broadcast standards and expensive public health campaigns. When regulation dominates, extreme views can move underground  into less monitored areas such as film which enjoys a wider scope to explore ideas and issues concerning a culture. Agencies which have more freedom to represent madness beyond objective journalistic conventions can be more subversive. This work takes Foucault&#8217;s archaeology of madness (among other works) as its point of departure to look at cinematic representations of madness, exploring the notion that cinema reflects and reinforces the asylum discourse. It investigates cinema as a strategy of neurotic reiteration to confine madness in narrative&#8212;to close down the spectre of the Other&#8212;in cultural structures to exorcise it from the collective consciousness. Commercial imperatives drive stigmatising representations of madness, drawing on cultural loadings inherent in the asylum discourse, trading on demonising and pathologising to exacerbate drama and tension, essential elements of tragedy. Foucault&#8217;s framework is the basis for detailed analyses and close readings of a selection of cinematic representations, critiquing their role as constituent of, and constituting, the spectacle of madness. The films considered are from New Zealand and dominant (i.e. Hollywood) cinema in order to permit comparisons between representations here and overseas. This work follows my master&#8217;s thesis (1999), which used a similar methodology to examine representations of suicide in cinema in four popular films. Here, I look at the ideas that represent knowledge and authority about madness as represented in discourses associated with cinema. I look at loadings of illness, moral failure, Otherness, animality, and the mechanisms through which the asylum discourse of containment and spectacle is validated (or otherwise). This links with Fuery&#8217;s discussion of madness and cinema, and madness as a necessary aspect of spectatorship that makes cinema possible. It also connects to my current employment on a project addressing stigma and discrimination against people with experience of madness.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">film</field><field name="subject">madness</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::410000 The Arts::410300 Cinema, Electronic Arts and Media Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5166</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Multi-agent based ambient intelligence platform</field><field name="creator">Wang, Kevin I-Kai</field><field name="description">The vision of Ambient Intelligence (AmI) can be realised through the integration of embedded technologies, distributed systems, middleware and human machine interfaces and many research efforts have been made to advance these technologies. However, the exclusiveness of these ambient intelligence technologies has reduced their practical values. In this thesis, a novel AmI platform is proposed to facilitate the integration and interoperability of various technologies in the process of developing AmI applications. The platform defines the overall software/hardware architecture and communication interfaces and provides a common base for development, operation and future adaptation of AmI applications.	The proposed platform consists of four layers, the physical ubiquitous environment, middleware, multi-agent system (MAS) and application layer. The ubiquitous environment layer accommodates any type of embedded device network for interconnecting different sensors, actuators and computing devices. The middleware layer is built using an IP-based service discovery protocol, Universal Plug and Play (UPnP), which provides a unique communication interface for controlling and monitoring embedded devices. The MAS handles the core distributed and adaptive control functionality and communication with user interfaces. The application layer contains any type of user interface for different AmI applications. An XML-based content language is designed with an XML schema and seven XML messages. The content language standardises the way of interpreting contents of communication between different user interfaces and the MAS.	Based on the proposed platform, a complete AmI application prototype called Distributed Embedded Intelligence Room (DEIR) has been implemented. Four different device networks, the SmartHouse network, IP network, Bluetooth and Zigbee network, have been integrated in DEIR to interconnect various embedded sensors and devices. The MAS is implemented using Java Agent DEvelopment framework (JADE). Four application specific agents, known as the UPnP control point agent, IP interface agent, fuzzy inference agent and decision tree agent, are designed and implemented. The UPnP control point agent provides MAS the ability to monitor and to control the underlying hardware devices through the UPnP middleware layer. The IP interface agent handles communication with user interfaces over socket connections. Fuzzy inference and decision tree agents are implemented to provide personalised learning and automated control capabilities. Three user interfaces, including a remote graphical user interface, a mobile PDA interface and a 3D virtual reality interface are implemented. Contents of communication between these user interfaces and the MAS are encoded using the proposed XML content language and transmitted over socket connections.	The AmI application prototype, DEIR, has demonstrated the ability of integrating multiple device networks and multiple user interfaces, which is a vital feature for most AmI applications. Two case studies have been carried out to incorporate two adaptive learning and controlling algorithms, known as the adaptive online fuzzy inference system (AOFIS) and ID3 decision tree algorithm, in the MAS of DEIR. The results of case studies show that DEIR has the ability of incorporating multiple adaptive control algorithms as multiple agents. In addition, comparable or better offline learning accuracy and learning speed have been achieved by DEIR compared with other advanced adaptive control algorithms.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Ambient Intelligence</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290900 Electrical and Electronic Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5212</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Transparencies: New Zealand from 1953 to 1974 through the slide photography of Gladys Cunningham</field><field name="creator">Benjamin, Julie Maree</field><field name="description">Transparencies: New Zealand from 1953 to 1974 through the Slide Photography of Gladys Cunningham This thesis focuses on the amateur slide photography of Gladys Cunningham, formerly of Onehunga, Auckland. Viewed collectively, these slides provide a visual autobiography of a New Zealand woman&#8217;s life, as well as a larger social narrative. As Gladys&#8217;s granddaughter, I argue that Gladys&#8217;s 35mm colour transparencies, nostalgic fragments that memorialise a family history, are informed by the social history of European New Zealanders between the early 1950s and early 1970s. Gladys&#8217;s slides reflect stabilities and changes for the photographer herself, her family and New Zealand society. While the term &#8220;transparency&#8221; suggests that the meaning of a slide can be understood by all, in reality further contextual information is necessary to appreciate the family and public histories from which these scenes have been separated. To situate Gladys&#8217;s slides, I refer to popular magazines and tourist texts from this period, including The Weekly News, National Geographic and New Zealand Holiday, and to commercial slides, postcards and travel marketing texts. I analyse the near absence of Maori within Gladys&#8217;s slides and travel journalism, suggesting that their omissions represent a lack of dialogue between Pakeha and Maori. In New Zealand and overseas, slide photography was the popular medium for recording extraordinary family events during the 1950 and 1960s. Through an analysis of memory, leisure and photography, this study examines how Gladys&#8217;s photography documents family and community membership and celebration. I explore how aesthetically pleasing representations of family leisure also contain partly concealed clues to less positive memories and to secrets that were not unique to this family. I discuss the impact of private and public transport on Gladys&#8217;s slide photography, noting how car travel facilitated spatial and temporal freedoms, and how slide photography strengthened connections to extended family and distant communities. In contrast, Gladys and Jim&#8217;s later dependence on coach transport enhanced their ability to take slides and expanded the &#8220;family&#8221; gaze of their camera, but limited their photographic opportunities.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">New Zealand Social Life and customs</field><field name="subject">New Zealand Social Conditions</field><field name="subject">Travel photography</field><field name="subject">Landscape Photography new Zealand</field><field name="subject">Nostalgia</field><field name="subject">Autobiographical Memory</field><field name="subject">Photography of Families</field><field name="subject">Women New Zealand Auckland Biography</field><field name="subject">Photography Social Aspects New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Photography New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Camera Clubs</field><field name="subject">Visual Culture</field><field name="subject">Amateur Photography</field><field name="subject">Slides (Photography)</field><field name="subject">Women Photographers New Zealand Biography</field><field name="subject">Slides (Transparencies)</field><field name="subject">Tourism New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Leisure Social Aspects New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Community Life New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Family New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Photographic Society of New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Onehunga (Auckland NZ) History</field><field name="subject">Automobiles Social Aspects New Zealand</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/4964</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterisation of the molecular complexes that regulate the G2/M checkpoint of the eukaryotic cell cycle</field><field name="creator">Collings, Melanie</field><field name="description">The cell cycle is one of the fundamental processes in nature, and is primarily concerned with the faithful replication of cellular contents, followed by even division to produce two identical daughter cells. It is made up of five discrete biochemical steps, comprising the interphase (G1, S and G2) and the mitotic phase (mitosis and cytokinesis), with two major regulatory checkpoints at G1 and G2. The focus of this research is the G2 checkpoint, which ensures the successful achievement of DNA replication, prior to the initiation of mitosis. Arrest or progression is principally mediated by the CDK1/cyclin B1 complex; phosphorylation of CDK1 by wee1 kinase prevents progression to mitosis, and subsequent dephosphorylation by the CDC25 phosphatases, initially the B isoform, leads to mitotic onset.  The aim of this research was the biophysical and/or biochemical characterisation of the molecular complexes that form at the G2 checkpoint to regulate entry into mitosis. CDK1 and cyclin B1 were separately expressed and purified from baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells. The wee1/14-3-3&#946; complex was also expressed and purified, incorporating either full length wee1 or a truncated version from which the N-terminal domain of wee1 was deleted. Both exhibited wee1 kinase activity, at equivalent levels, p&lt;0.001, with a 2.4 fold increase in kinase activity when wee1 is bound by 14-3-3&#946;, p&gt;0.001. Tryptic digestion of the complex indicated that its architecture was likely to be flexible and open, particularly within the N-terminal domain of wee1. CD analyses indicated that the wee1/14-3-3&#946; complex was folded, with 30-40% &#945;-helical content and 10-20% &#946;-sheet content. Dissociation experiments were unsuccessful, however, indicating a high strength of interaction between wee1 and 14-3-3&#946;. The empirical stoichiometry of the complex was determined as 1:1; subsequent native molecular weight determination suggested that the minimal functional unit is likely to be a 2:2 wee1/14-3-3&#946; arrangement. It was proposed that the structural architecture of this complex may be similar to the serotonin N-acetyltransferase/14-3-3&#950; complex. Experiments to determine the structure experimentally, using either TEM or x-ray crystallography, were unsuccessful, as the complex appeared to exhibit a high degree of flexibility in solution.  CDC25B was also expressed and purified, and was found to co-purify with a putative Sf9 14-3-3 protein. Consequently, it was re-cloned to co-express with 14-3-3&#946;, and subsequent analysis of the resulting CDC25B/14-3-3&#946; complex indicated that the empirical stoichiometry was 1:1, with the functional organization likely to be a 2:2 arrangement. It was proposed that the structural arrangement of this complex is most likely to be similar to that of the wee1/14-3-3&#946; complex.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5169</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Remembering the past, thinking of the present: Historic commemorations in New Zealand and Northern Ireland, 1940-1990</field><field name="creator">Robinson, Helen Alexandra</field><field name="description">This thesis analyses and compares two historic commemorations in Northern Ireland with two in New Zealand, in the period from 1940 to 1990. These commemorations are the Twelfth of July and Remembrance Sunday in Northern Ireland, and Waitangi Day and Anzac Day in New Zealand. Examination of these commemorations has revealed several patterns. In the commemorations studied in this thesis, levels of public adherence generally depended on the extent to which the values that the commemoration symbolised were seen as threatened or highly needed. The commemorations which reaffirmed compelling values tended to enjoy higher levels of public support than those expressing values which were seen as either unnecessary or unthreatened. In both countries, historic commemorations were capable of uniting communities behind core values. However, in cases where there was no general agreement on what those values were or what they meant, commemorations frequently became sites of division and conflict. All four commemorations were regularly used by organisers and participants to express views on contemporary political and social issues and, on several occasions in both countries, different groups battled for the control of particular commemorations. In both countries, increased levels of social conflict often led to the increased use of the past as a rhetorical device. The main conclusion to be drawn from this study is that these historic commemora&#172;tions derived more of their meaning from their contemporary context than from the historical events which they commemorated. In particular, how the public viewed and understood the values symbolised and reaffirmed by the commemorations strongly affected their levels of support. People were most likely to observe the commem-orations when they were seen as symbolising values which were widely adhered to and seen as threatened or urgently needed. The historic commemorations examined in this thesis were often strongly affected by contemporary events which were seen as relating, positively or negatively, to the values which the commemorations embodied.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Commemorations</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Northern Ireland</field><field name="subject">Waitangi Day</field><field name="subject">Anzac Day</field><field name="subject">Remembrance Sunday</field><field name="subject">Twelfth of July</field><field name="subject">Orange Order</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::430000 History and Archaeology::430100 Historical Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5380</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A "stupendous attraction" : materialising a Tibetan Buddhist contact zone in rural Australia</field><field name="creator">McAra, Sally, 1967-</field><field name="description">When people, ideas or things migrate across cultural milieux, many opportunities for cultural transformation arise. The focal point of this thesis is a large stupa/temple (Great Stupa) being built at Atisha Centre, a Buddhist retreat near Bendigo in Australia, by members of an international organisation called the Foundation for the Preservation of the Mahayana Tradition (FPMT). I approach the planning, promotion and construction of the stupa as an instance of the transplantation of religious material culture, arguing that Atisha Centre and particularly the stupa play a constitutive role by acting as a contact zone (Pratt 1992). Since the Centre is a site of alternate social ordering in which the Buddhists attempt to actualise their universalist ideals in a specific place, I also conceptualise it as a heterotopia (Foucault 1986, Hetherington 1997). The contact zone entails engagement between different socio-cultural domains. One of the key domains is the globalisation of contemporary Buddhism and its permutations in new locales. Stemming from this is the question of how the Buddhists and their imported material culture engage with wider concerns such as various non-FPMT Buddhist, Anglo- Australian and Aboriginal locals&#8217; responses towards the transplantation of a Tibetan temple into a rural Australian locale. The complex and shifting relationships between different kinds of Buddhism feature in relation to different ideas about the value of holy objects. The FPMT conforms to the enlightenment-oriented ideals of &#8220;Buddhist modernism&#8221; (McMahan 2008) but appears to depart from it in its pronounced emphasis on merit-making and holy objects. However, the project&#8217;s proponents consider the stupa a method for enacting their enlightenment aspirations. I attribute the stupa project&#8217;s relatively smooth passage through local planning application procedures to proponents&#8217; prior social and cultural capital, which I link to positive public perceptions of Buddhism, aspirations for Bendigo to become more culturally diverse and the economic development the stupa is expected to bring. The literally concrete structure of the stupa not only provides Buddhists with a tangible focal point for their ideals, but also serves as a vehicle for the establishment of Tibetan Buddhism in a new land.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370300 Anthropology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5234</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Application of fracture mechanics to finger joints</field><field name="creator">Shi, Lihong</field><field name="description">Application of linear Elastic Fracture mechanics to the finger joint was studied through three aspects: computational analysis, experiments and statistical methods. After the study these following conclusions were found: 1. There is an effect of material mechanical properties on the strength of a cracked body where material orthotropy exists. The degree of the effect depends on the loading configuration, crack(s) location and size and ratio(s) of material properties. 2. Collinear cracks across a slab can be simply treated as an edge cracked slab if the pitch of collinear cracks is three times of the length of a crack. 3. Strength of a finger jointed specimen is related to components material properties and finger profile. 4. A specimen made by high quality grade timber jointed to low grade timber usually has its strength is neither increased nor decreased, unless the outer finger root is located on the component made from high quality grade timber. 5. When a finger jointed specimen failed at the finger joint, the fracture mostly happened at the outer finger root, a small proportion had the fracture initiate from the first inner tooth root. Propagation of fracture either went straight up first or went straight inclined first. As long as the length of a shouldered specimen increases, the straight up fracture propagation, F11 failure mode, becomes more unlikely. 6. Linear fracture mechanics can be applied to a finger jointed specimen but the implementation would not be simple. The direct implementation of linear fracture mechanics to finger jointed problems may lead to the unsatisfaction results and not be useful for practice. 7. Applied statistics to the test results, and the characteristic strength of a finger jointed specimen was evaluated. The lower tolerance limits of modulus of rupture for different finger profile finger jointed specimens is greater than the lower tolerance limits of timber grade F5. Finger jointing applied to lower grade timber will not reduce its lower tolerance limit (L.T.L.) but increase it. Apparent fracture toughness then was calculated based on the characteristic strength, and it was related to the thickness of a finger or length of a shoulder.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5562</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Virtual Chinatown: the diasporic mediasphere of Chinese migrants in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Li, Phoebe Hairong</field><field name="description">This is a study of the social dynamics of the current Chinese migrant community in New Zealand through a critical analysis of the Auckland-based Chinese-language media. It combines two research fields, international migration studies and media studies, to conceptualise Chinese-language media as a specific type of alternative media in contemporary New Zealand. The Chinese population in New Zealand has rapidly increased through immigration since the passage of the 1987 Immigration Act; Chinese now comprise 3.4% of the New Zealand population, and a wide variety of Chinese-language media have accordingly thrived in New Zealand. In contrast to New Zealand mainstream media, these Chinese media serve the specific needs and interests of newly arrived and only minimally acculturated Chinese migrants. The research was conducted in three phases: quantitative and qualitative data were acquired from the content of Chinese-language media during the period of the 2005 New Zealand general election; qualitative data were obtained from focus groups and interviews with members of the Chinese audience subsequent to the election; qualitative data were generated from Chinese media personnel. The findings suggest that these Chinese-language media closely reflect and depict recent PRC Chinese migrants&#8217; perceptions of New Zealand and aspirations towards their new life in the host country. Within the global context of the Chinese diaspora in historical and contemporary times, this research also introduces a new angle for exploring the socio-economic impacts of China as a rising superpower on New Zealand and the Pacific Rim.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370500 Demography::370502 Migration</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420300 Cultural Studies::420304 Screen and media studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5561</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Identification of yeast genes involved in sauvignon blanc aroma development</field><field name="creator">Harsch, Michael Johannes</field><field name="description">The grape variety Sauvignon Blanc (SB) is the flagship of New Zealand&#8217;s wine industry and accounted for over 75 % of the value of total wine exports in 2008. Two volatile thiols, 3-mercaptohexan-1-ol (3MH) and 3-mercaptohexyl-acetate (3MHA), reminiscent of grapefruit and passion fruit respectively, are critical for the main varietal characters in New Zealand SB. These aromatic thiols are not present in the grape juice, but are synthesized and released by the yeast during alcoholic fermentation from non-aromatic precursors. The aim of this work was to elucidate the underlying genetics of volatile thiol synthesis in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) during alcoholic fermentation of grape juice. A gene-deletion strategy was chosen for the investigation of putative genes influencing 3MH and 3MHA release. The first part of this thesis optimized fermentation conditions in grape-juice-based media, which enabled auxotrophic laboratory strains, derived from S288C, to ferment grape juice to completion with high efficiency. Key steps to achieving this goal were the supplementation of the grape juice with higher than recommended amounts of amino acids, which increased the fermentation rate of auxotrophic yeast strains. Lysine auxotrophic strains especially benefited from this measure. In combination with the dilution of SB grape juice by 25 % with synthetic grape juice without sugars, the auxotrophic laboratory yeast BY4743 was able to metabolize all sugars in the grape juice-based media in a time frame similar to that of a commercial wine yeast. The key properties of the resulting wine were comparable to wine made with a commercial wine yeast under the same conditions. In the second part, these newly developed fermentation conditions were employed to screen 69 single-gene deletion strains in the laboratory yeast background BY4743. The list of the 69 candidate genes was compiled by combining existing knowledge about thiol production in yeast with the mining of several biological databases. Screening of the single-gene deletions revealed 17 genes which caused biologically relevant increases or decreases in volatile thiol production, but none abolished it. The majority of the 17 genes were related to the sulfur and nitrogen metabolism in yeast. A subset of these thiol-influencing genes were also deleted in a wine yeast, and were overexpressed in both wine yeast and laboratory yeast, to gain more insight in their regulatory effects. The findings confirmed that sulfur and nitrogen metabolism in yeast were important in regulating 3MH and 3MHA synthesis. Different sulfur and nitrogen sources were added to the grape must prior to fermentation and their effect on thiol release was studied. It was found that nitrogen sources urea and DAP, as well as, the sulfur compound S-ethyl-L-cysteine (SEC) increased 3MH and 3MHA concentrations in the resulting wines. The addition of cysteine to grape juice fermented with wine yeast deleted in genes CYS3 and CYS4 more than doubled total thiol production. Mapping approaches to investigate thiol production in yeast were employed in the final part of this thesis. Genetically mapped F2 progeny of a cross between a low thiol-producing yeast strain and a high-thiol producer were screened for their thiol phenotype. The 3MH and 3MHA phenotypes across 48 screened F2 progeny resembled normal distributions, indicating a quantitative trait. Subsequent mapping identified a locus on chromosome 14 with a small effect on the 3MHA phenotype, but no obvious candidate genes were evident in the region. Another approach to investigate the evolution of volatile thiols in yeast included the use of SEC, a thiol compound resembling the cysteinylated precursor of 3MH, as a sole nitrogen source in a yeast growth assay. It was found that most wine yeast, European yeast isolates and laboratory yeasts could utilize SEC as a nitrogen source, whereas various other S. cerevisiae isolates could not. Crosses between three pairs of Sec- and Sec+ yeast strains strongly indicated that this trait was monogenically inherited. However, no direct correlation between the SEC phenotype and volatile release could be observed. Genetic mapping experiments in one SEC-segregating yeast population linked this SEC phenotype to the leu2-D0 deletion in a cross between a Leu+ and Leu- yeast strain. It was shown that leucine auxotrophy most likely caused the Sec- phenotype. In a second F2 population of a cross between prototrophic Sec+ and Sec- strains, strong linkage was established to a region on chromosome 6 containing two candidate genes, DUG1 and IRC7. DUG1 was proved not to be the cause of the SEC phenotype, whereas IRC7 remains a strong candidate gene.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">volatile thiols</field><field name="subject">Sauvignon Blanc</field><field name="subject">aroma</field><field name="subject">genes</field><field name="subject">3-mercaptohexan-1-ol</field><field name="subject">3-mercaptohexyl-acetate</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5293</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Pressure assisted thermal sterilization: a novel means of processing foods</field><field name="creator">Wimalaratne, Sajith Kanchana</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates a newly developed and patented technology for its ability to inactivate spore- forming bacteria and non-spore-forming microorganisms. This new technology &#8220;Pressure Assisted Thermal Sterilization&#169;&#8221; (PATS) is based on the theory of the thermal expansion of liquids. The efficiency of inactivating spore-forming and non-spore-forming microorganisms by PATS was compared with the thermal treatment alone. A combination treatment consisting of high pressure processing and gaseous carbon dioxide was also investigated for its ability to inactivate bacterial spores in model and real food matrices. The structural damage caused by treatments to the spores and non-spore-forming bacteria was assessed by scanning electron microscopy.  Geobacillus stearothermophilus spores suspended in Milli-Q water, UHT milk and pumpkin soup, treated by PATS were found to have significantly lower decimal reduction times (D values) compared with the thermal treatment alone. Spores suspended in UHT milk were more heat resistant compared with those in Milli-Q water and pumpkin soup. Bacillus cereus spores suspended in Milli-Q water and pumpkin soup treated with PATS were more effectively inactivated compared with spores treated by the thermal treatment alone. Clostridium botulinum spores in saline buffer subjected to PATS treatment were inactivated more effectively compared with the thermal treatment alone. Overall, the results show that PATS was a better processing technique for inactivation of bacterial spores compared with thermal treatment alone. However, PATS had no added benefit in inactivating the non-spore-forming bacteria Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells compared with the thermal treatment. A shelf life study showed that B. cereus spores in pumpkin soup retained a low spore count (&lt;5 LogCFU/mL) for approximately 40 days in 30oC storage after treatment with PATS. No additional degradation of colour pigments of pumpkin soup and model pumpkin juice was observed following PATS compared with the thermal treatment. Spore-forming microorganisms can be resistant to pressure treatment alone, which limits the application of high pressure processing (HPP). Therefore, a combination approach was investigated. The mechanism of inactivating spores by combining HPP with other treatments is that the pressure assists in spore germination. Then a secondary treatment (thermal or CO2 gas) can be used to inactivate the germinated spores. A combined application of HPP and a consecutive CO2 treatment was investigated for the efficiency of spore inactivation. Results showed that HPP (200 MPa for 30 min) followed by a CO2 treatment inactivated Bacillus subtilis 168 in nutrient broth, tomato juice and liquid whole egg by 2.5, 1.0 and 1.5 LogCFU/mL respectively. These results indicated that this technique is inadequate for practical use. Scanning electron micrographs showed that pressure processing of B. subtilis 168 and B. subtilis natto spores resulted in deformation of the spore structure. This structural deformation of spores may have been due to water absorption during HPP and subsequent release upon decompression. PATS treated G. stearothermophilus and B. cereus spores were more severely damaged compared with the same spores which underwent thermal treatment alone. However, the extent to which E. coli and S. cerevisiae cells were damaged by both PATS and thermal treatment was similar.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">High Pressure Processing</field><field name="subject">Pressure Assisted Thermal Sterilization</field><field name="subject">Food Processing</field><field name="subject">Novel Food Processing Technologies</field><field name="subject">Combined High Pressure Processing and Carbon Dioxide Treatment</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290100 Industrial Biotechnology and Food Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5294</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An unblinking gaze: on the philosophy of the Marquis de Sade</field><field name="creator">Roche, Geoffrey T.</field><field name="description">Throughout the 20th Century, a number of philosophers, writers, artists and film makers have implied that there is some profound significance to the work of Donatien Alphonse Fran&#231;ois, the Marquis de Sade (1740-1814).

Firstly, I will consider the various philosophical interpretations of Sade&#8217;s work. This part of the study will serve as a guide into the Sadeian labyrinth, and will establish some of the more central interpretive themes, in particular the claim that Sade&#8217;s thought anticipates that of the Nazis, or that he brings early Modern thought to its logical conclusion. Secondly, I will inquire into Sade&#8217;s writings themselves.

Previous studies of these drugs have indicated that they may be metabolised by hepatic enzymes of the cytochrome P450 (CYP) family. However, the metabolism, pharmacokinetic properties and drug interactions of these drugs are poorly understood. This thesis aimed to develop and apply an analytical method to the detection of these drugs, to investigate their in vitro and in vivo biotransformation, to describe their pharmacokinetic properties in humans and describe the potential for drug-drug interactions. An analytical method consisting of a reversed phase HPLC system coupled with MS using an Agilent Zorbax CI8 HPLC column (4.6 x 150 mm, 5 &#956;m) with guard column (C18, 4.6 x 10 mm, 5 &#956;m) at 20 &#176;C and a mobile phase of ammonium formate buffer (pH 4.5, 0.01 M, solvent A) and acetonitrile (solvent B) with a phase gradient and total run time of 15 minutes was developed and validated for the detection of BZP and TFMPP plus three hydroxylated metabolites in plasma. In vitro inhibition assays with human liver preparations were used to study the metabolism of these drugs. By using inhibitors quinidine, furafylline and troleandomycin it was found that CYP2D6, CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 metabolise both BZP and TFMPP. CYP2D6 poor metaboliser status was shown to compromise metabolism of TFMPP both in vitro and in vivo. For the human pharmacokinetic study, three groups of seven healthy human participants were dosed with either BZP HCI (200 mg) or TFMPP HCl (60 mg) or both drugs (100 mg ofBZP HCl and 30 mg ofTFMPP HCl). BZP and TFMPP reached maximum plasma concentrations of 262 ng/mL and 24.1 ng/mL at 75 minutes and 90 minutes respectively, and were cleared from the plasma of participants within 24 hr. In vitro and in vivo interactions were evident in this data, most notably the in vivo inhibition of the hydroxylation of each drug in the presence of the other. In summary, this thesis presents the results of some of the first studies on the metabolism and pharmacokinetics of these drugs in humans and sets the stage for future studies on the pharmacology of these commonly-used recreational drugs.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5353</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Influence of post-aerobic exercise nutrition on protein turnover and mitochondrial biogenesis</field><field name="creator">Murphy, Cheryl</field><field name="description">The desire to age well is a common goal among the human population. How to do so is therefore, a popular question. One theory of ageing involves the accumulation of damage to mitochondrial protein and the subsequent loss of function the damage causes. Increasing the rate of mitochondrial protein synthesis, a variable that declines with advancing age, is one way to improve quality of life in the twilight years. A review of literature lead to a multi-level approach, with measurements of protein synthesis made at the whole body, muscle, and molecular levels. An acute bout of aerobic exercise, followed by feeding, two factors which have a positive effect on the rate of mitochondrial protein synthesis, was used. Adaptations to a period of exercise training are mediated by the accumulation of proteins due to each acute exercise bout, and so an acute intervention was postulated to be indicative of changes expected over the long term. A stable isotope infusion combined with sampling of breath, blood, and muscle was used to determine the rate of whole body protein synthesis in 12 older adults. Intracellular signalling for mitochondrial and whole body protein synthesis was examined using RT-quantitative PCR and Western blotting in eleven young adults. The rate of post-exercise whole body protein synthesis was 19% greater over the first four hours of post-exercise recovery, in subjects receiving a protein-plus-carbohydrate drink immediately after a bout of cycling than in those receiving a carbohydrate-only drink (p = 0.001). The same trend was revealed in signalling for whole body protein synthesis and the abundance of cytochrome c, a mitochondrial protein, although these results were not statistically significant (p = 0.2). In contrast there was a strong, albeit also statistically insignificant, tendency for signalling for mitochondrial protein synthesis to be higher in the skeletal muscle of subjects receiving a carbohydrate-only drink after a bout of cycling (p = 0.06). The exercise and feeding intervention described in this thesis may provide a means to enhance the rate of mitochondrial protein synthesis in older individuals and, in so doing, improve the quality of their old age.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321400 Human Movement and Sports Science</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5429</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Anatomically-based, subject-specific modelling of lower limb motion during gait</field><field name="creator">Oberhofer, Katja</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::291500 Biomedical Engineering::291504 Biomechanical engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5444</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reading storybooks in Vietnamese families as a language intervention: an activity analysis</field><field name="creator">Tran, Thanh-Binh Thi</field><field name="description">Leont'ev understood activity as a mutually influenced process between the subject and the objective world. This process makes changes in both the subject and the objective world. He described activity as a system with its own structure which is created by its basic components and interrelationships among these components and the environment in which the activity exists (Leont'ev, 1978, 1981). In this research, an adapted model of Leont'ev's activity psychology, incorporating Gal'perin's stage model of formation of mental action and concepts (Gal'perin, 1992), and other developmental concepts (Bronfenbronner, 1979; Bruner, 1977; McNaughton, 1995; Rogoff, 1990, 2003; Vygotsky, 1978), was employed for design, implementation and evaluation of a family storybook reading activity intervention. This new approach of joint activity to early language intervention is the original contribution of the present research. This research aimed to describe and demonstrate effects of the intervention on individual children's vocabulary and comprehension development, before school and over the transition to school. A semi longitudinal set of case studies combined with a single-subject experimental design was chosen. Less well educated Vietnamese parents were provided with support, in order to develop their children's language, through storybook reading. Six families in Vietnam received storybooks, a workshop with shared reading techniques, a DVD of family shared reading samples, and home coaching sessions.  The data from the Baseline, Intervention and Maintenance phases showed that the parents made changes in their understanding of: Family shared reading benefits, how to select high-quality storybooks and how to set reading goals suitable to their own child's ability and interest. They also improved their shared reading techniques. Through the joint reading activity, the children's vocabulary increased significantly, especially in using expressive words. Changes in narrative comprehension were recorded. This progress was sustained over a period of 22 weeks after the intervention. The findings provide evidence of the completeness and generativeness of the theoretical framework for family literacy education. The model acted as a tool to guide a family literacy intervention. The research population was small and further studies in different literacy learning and teaching contexts are needed to enhance its practical implications.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5445</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of conducting polymer-based antioxidant packaging materials</field><field name="creator">Hsu, Chyong Fang</field><field name="description">Antioxidants are commonly used as preservatives for protecting foodstuffs from oxidation. Packaging is believed not only to increase the economic value of products but also improve their qualities. Conducting polymers (CPs), such as soluble polyaniline and soluble polypyrrole, have been reported to exhibit antioxidant activity. Development of conducting polymer containing packaging materials, with antioxidant properties, is therefore the focus of this project. Polypyrrole (PPy), polyaniline (PANI) and poly (3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) powders were prepared using various amounts of the oxidant ammonium persulfate (APS). Spectroscopic methods, including IR and Raman, were used to identify the structures of the CP powders synthesized at various APS levels. It was found that a high level of APS led to overoxidation of the CP powders. The conductivity and doping level of the CP powders formed using higher concentrations of the APS oxidant were found to be lower than those prepared using low concentrations of APS, which might be due to overoxidation, damaging the CP structures during the preparation processes. The antioxidant activity of PPy, PANI and PEDOT powders were evaluated using the DPPH and ABTS assays. The results showed that CP powders synthesized at a high concentration of APS presented lower free radical quenching effects, likely also due to overoxidation. The optimum initial ratio of APS to monomer for the synthesis of CP powders with a superior DPPH free radical scavenging was found to be around 0.5 for PPy, 1.5 for PANI and 1.0 for PEDOT, and the antioxidant ranking of the CP powders was as follows: PANI1.5 &gt; PPy0.5 &gt; PEDOT1.0. The reduced forms of PPy, PANI and PEDOT exhibited better radical scavenging abilities than the as-prepared powders. PANI nanotubes, synthesized at high pH, was also found to exhibit stronger free radical scavenging activity than the regular granular PANI formed under acidic conditions. Structural changes of PANI powders after reaction with free radicals were observed in IR and XPS spectra, showing an increase in the ratio of imine (C=N) to amine (C-N) units. PANI EC films were prepared using a solution method and the antioxidant capacity of the PANI EC films are examined using the ORAC assay. The results showed efficient peroxyl free radical scavenging activity of the PANI EC films. A very good correlation between the ORAC response and the area of tested film was also observed, indicating a homogenous dispersion of active PANI powder across the film. Similar to the results obtained from the DPPH and ABTS assays, reduced PANI presented greater peroxyl radical scavenging activity than the as-prepared powders. The influence of the PANI EC films on the oxidation of Ropufa oil was determined by peroxide value (PV) measurement. After incubation at 60oC for several days, the oil stored in the presence of the PANI EC film was found to exhibit a lower PV than in the absence of a CP film, indicating that the conducting polymer is effective in inhibiting oxidation of fish oil.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5446</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Tracking Heaphy: travels in the New Zealand landscape</field><field name="creator">Walker, Celia</field><field name="description">Charles Heaphy was a nineteenth-century artist, surveyor, explorer, politician and soldier, whose work was inextricably linked with the colonisation process in New Zealand. Heaphy&#8217;s views of the landscape were framed by pictorial and social interests, and his travels were motivated by personal and professional concerns. This study focuses on specific journeys largely undertaken early in Heaphy&#8217;s career, due to the wealth of material available to document those times. The journeys assessed in detail are: his travels on the New Zealand Company ship the Tory; his exploratory expeditions in Taranaki, the Nelson region and the West Coast of the South Island; and his work with the geologist Hochstetter. Heaphy&#8217;s paintings, drawings and lithographs are examined alongside his published and unpublished texts in order to arrive at a more complex understanding of his oeuvre. The relationship between Heaphy&#8217;s work and that of his contemporaries such as William Fox and Edward Jerningham Wakefield is also considered. This study investigates Heaphy&#8217;s work within the context of recent travel and landscape theory, and uses these ideas to look at his representations as products of the colonial world. Alongside such post-colonial considerations is a discussion of his use of numerous pre-existing genres and conventions, and how those relate to the meanings of his depicted and described landscapes. Some of those conventions, such as the picturesque and the sublime, affect both visual and written material; others he utilised, such as in his hunting still-life and bird paintings, were exclusively pictorial forms. It is argued that interpreting his work from a single theoretical perspective would be reductive. The intertwining of these tropes with his actual experiences of place and his underlying political motivations make possible multi-layered readings of his works. By examining these various aspects of his travels and ways of recording, this study aims to contribute to the discourse about colonial landscapes, and the cultural construction of New Zealand.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5482</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterisation of delayed release granules for diphacinone: formulation for the control of brushtail possum in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Chan, Judy</field><field name="description">Background and Aim: The common brushtail possum (Trichosurus velpecula) causes more damage to the environment than any other vertebrate species in New Zealand. The use of poison remains the main method for possum population control. Diphacinone is an anticoagulant that produces toxic effects by inhibiting the production of vitamin K&#8211;dependent coagulation factors which lead to profuse haemorrhage and eventually, death. The objective of this thesis was to investigate the potential of diphacinone as a toxin for the control of possum population in New Zealand. Methods: The preformulation of diphacinone included the development and validation of an analytical method, spectral identification, investigation of melting behaviour, solubility, and the determination of ionisation constant. The permeability of diphacinone across the ileal tissue of possum was assessed using a modified Ussing chamber model. Diphacinone granules were developed to prolong drug release and retention by in vitro dissolution and tensile testing. A factorial study was employed to optimise the granulation process by identifying significant process variables that influenced the yield percentage, size distribution and water uptake of granules.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5483</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Does M&#257;ori Representation Matter?: an analysis of the relationship between M&#257;ori descriptive and substantive political representation in parliament and local government</field><field name="creator">Summersby, Kim Margaret</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted until 12/2011, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5484</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Columnar cuff, anal transitional zone and ileal pouch mucosa in restorative proctocolectomy</field><field name="creator">Thompson-Fawcett, Mark W</field><field name="description">The formation of a pelvic ileal reservoir or pouch for patients requiring a proctocolectomy for ulcerative colitis or familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) has gained rapid favour over recent years. The operation has evolved by empiric practice with the progressive refinement of operative technique. There is still debate over whether to retain or remove the anal transitional zone (ATZ). This debate relates to concern about the neoplastic and inflammatory potential of diseased mucosa if retained in the anal canal. Similarly the chronic inflammatory changes observed in ileal pouch mucosa have raised the possibility that neoplasia may be a long term consequence of forming the ileum into a pouch. This thesis investigates these issues. The work begins with a review of the literature on the ATZ and its importance in restorative proctocolectomy. Following this a detailed study of the micro anatomy of the anal canal is carried out on 28 anal canals. The median span of the ATZ was found to be only 4.5 millimetres and it contains almost no columnar epithelium. However an important area termed the columnar cuff was identified. In a patient who does not have a mucosectomy, the columnar cuff constitutes a span of diseased Columnar epithelium extending over 1 5 to 2.5 cm in the upper anal canal. Long term concerns need to focus on the columnar cuff rather than the ATZ. The columnar cuff and ATZ in 113 patients with an ileal pouch has been studied. These patients had an examination with the intention of biopsying the anal canal and ileal pouch to study the ATZ and columnar cuff. It was possible to obtain a successful biopsy of the columnar cuff in 72% of cases. The technique of staining for the small bowel brush border enzyme sucrase isomaltase has been developed and shown to reliably distinguish between pouch mucosa with villous atrophy and columnar cuff mucosa. The same group of patients was followed over a 2.5 year period and 9% were shown to have symptomatic &#8216;cuffitis&#8217;. A histological scoring system is described and a diagnostic triad of symptoms, endoscopic inflammation and acute inflammation on histology is put forward as a way to diagnose cuffitis. The same 113 patients had columnar cuff biopsies examined for dysplasia and aneuploidy at a mean of 2.5 years after pouch formation and 10.1 years after the diagnosis of ulcerative colitis. No dysplasia was found but one patient had aneuploidy in the columnar cuff. The final part of the work focuses on investigating the risk of neoplasia in ileal pouches. This work draws on a large cohort of 1221 patients with an ileal pouch and selects out a potentially higher risk group for pouch neoplasia. 106 patients who had a pouch for ulcerative colitis were selected, including 34 with chronic pouchitis. In addition 33 patients who had a pouch for FAP were studied. In the ulcerative colitis group one patient was found to have low grade dysplasia and aneuploidy and a further two patients aneuploidy. The risk of neoplasia in an ileal pouch for ulcerative colitis appears low and chronic pouchitis was not identified as a particular risk factor. In contrast adenomatous polyps were found in the ileal pouch of 42% of patients with FAP. It appears that forming the terminal ileum into a reservoir promotes the formation of ileal polyps. In conclusion forming the ileum into a pelvic reservoir to maintain continence appears to be a safe procedure with medium term follow up. It will be important to continue to gather data to establish the natural history of an ileal pouch. In the interim a level of follow up and surveillance for some groups of patients may be wise.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::320100 Medicine-General</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5495</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Management of chronic pelvic pain in women</field><field name="creator">Farquhar, Cynthia, 1956-</field><field name="description">Recent studies have demonstrated that 84% of women suffering from unexplained pelvic pain have dilated pelvic veins. Such appearances are generally considered to be evidence of &#8216;pelvic congestion&#8217;. Venographic studies of women without pain did not show these appearances. Management of pelvic congestion is considered difficult as there are few therapies currently available. Psychotherapy has been previously shown to be successful in the management of a number of painful conditions including women with chronic pelvic pain. Ovarian suppression with medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) has also been shown to reduce both venogram and pain scores. The first hypothesis of this thesis was that women with chronic pelvic pain in association with venographic evidence of pelvic congestion could be treated with medroxyprogesterone acetate and that longer term benefit could be obtained with the concurrent use of psychotherapy. The second hypothesis was that treatment with MPA will lower levels of pituitary gonadotrophins, the ovarian hormones, the karyopyknotic index (vaginal cytology) and reduce the dimensions of the uterus, endometrium, ovaries and pelvic veins. This thesis presents the results of a randomised controlled trial comparing two different treatment approaches; psychotherapy and ovarian suppression using MPA. One hundred and two women with pelvic congestion were randomly allocated to one of four treatment groups; MPA, MPA and psychotherapy, placebo, and placebo and psychotherapy. Women were treated for four months and thereafter followed up regularly for 9 months with pain assessments, pelvic ultrasound scanning and hormone measurements. Women treated with MPA showed a significant benefit in terms of a reduction in pain scores, with 73% of women reporting an improvement compared with 33% of those in the non-MPA groups. After 9 months therapy no clear drug effect emerged. Fifty percent of women in the placebo group were improved at the end of follow up. Those women who received MPA had significant reductions in the uterine cross-sectionnal area, endometrial thickness, oestradiol, testosterone and luteinising hormone levels. Medical therapy with MPA was shown to be a useful first line therapy for women with pain associated with demonstrable pelvic congestion.</field><field name="date">1991</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::320100 Medicine-General</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5498</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Anatomical and radiological basis of extrafascial excision of the rectum</field><field name="creator">Bissett, Ian Peter</field><field name="description">The operation of extrafascial excision dissects directly on the rectal fascia propria to remove the rectum and mesorectum within an intact fascial envelope. The studies contained in this thesis revolve around the recent finding that if a rectal cancer is contained within the fascia propria and the rectum is removed by extrafascial excision then local recurrence of the cancer will be exceptional. The thesis is presented in 4 parts as anatomical, radiological, clinical and operative sections. Gross and microscopic examination of surgical specimens, post-mortem dissections and axial cross sectional anatomy images were used to define the anatomy of the fascia propria. It is shown to be a 150&#956;m thick, collagen membrane completely surrounding the mesorectum. The hypogastric nerves and pelvic plexuses are embedded in the parietal fascia separated from the mesorectum and fascia propria by a loose areolar layer. A computerised three-dimensional model of the rectum and mesorectum has been generated based on 1mm axial cross sections of the anatomy of the area and axial MR scans offering the potential to visualise the rectum in its mesorectum preoperatively. A systematic review of preoperative radiological staging has been reported comparing endorectal ultrasound, CT and MR imaging. The ability to determine the relation of the tumour to the fascia propria preoperatively has, however, not been previously explored. Cadaveric studies in this thesis have demonstrated that the fascia propria can be identified by axial CT and MR imaging. In a consecutive series of 43 patients with rectal cancer preoperative MR accurately predicted the relation of the deepest tumour invasion to this fascia. In the third section extrafascial excision has been compared with conventional surgery at a single institution over a 16 year period. In a study population of 262 rectal cancer patients operated on with curative intent, extrafascial excision had a significantly lower local recurrence rate and prolonged cancer-free survival without an increase in cost or complication rates. Based on these studies a new description of the operation of extrafascial excision of the rectum is presented in the fourth section with emphasis on preventing complications. This thesis has provided a new understanding of the surgical anatomy of the rectum and a novel management protocol for rectal cancer based on the relationship of the tumour to the fascia propria as detected by preoperative MR imaging.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::320100 Medicine-General</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5500</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cerebral blood flow velocity variability in very low birthweight infants</field><field name="creator">Coughtrey, Heather</field><field name="description">Short-term variability in cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV) in the VLBW infant largely relates to respiratory influence. Extreme variability may be a poor prognostic indicator. Few have studied cohorts of babies in this regard. I sequentially studied a consecutive cohort of unselected VLBW infants, to determine the frequency of respiratory influence on CBFVV and to identify factors associated with its occurrence. Doppler CBFV, arterial BP and respiratory signals were recorded simultaneously and spectral analysis was applied to identify a respiratory signal in BP and CBFV traces. Respiratory associated variability was present in the cerebral circulation at some time in more than half of the infants studied and was most likely in those of lowest gestational age who were hypotensive. Mortality, and cerebral morbidity as assessed by cerebral ultrasound were more common in those demonstrating a respiratory influence in CBFV. There was a strong correlation between the coefficient of variation(CV%) of BP and that of CBFV. Babies demonstrating hypotension had higher CV%s in CBFV; those who did not survive showed higher variability than survivors, but there was a wide spread of values in both groups. where the variability in CBFV was high, correlation between CBFV and BP was greater. However, no significant association was found between CV% of CBFV and brain injury, ductal patency, or sedation. Although exaggerated beat-to-beat variability in CBFV was an adverse prognostic indicator, absence of variability carried the worst prognosis. Slow variations of cerebral blood flow velocity at a frequency of 1-5 cycles per minute, previously described as a normal phenomenon, were also examined. Evolution of this variability was studied amongst those present for a month or more. Slow variations diminished with both increasing postnatal and postconceptional age, perhaps representing maturation of the balance between the two components of the autonomic nervous system. The cycle length of the slow variations was variable suggesting the presence of several low frequency components; longer recordings would be needed to resolve these. Addition of serial Doppler measurements of CBFV performed in the first week of life, did not improve prediction of an 18-month outcome obtained from ultrasound imaging alone.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::320100 Medicine-General</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5502</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies of antibody, complement and immune complexes as mediators of immune-injury</field><field name="creator">Simpson, Ian James</field><field name="description">In guinea-pig nephrotoxic nephritis (NTN) induced by a sheep antibody there was minimal glomerular capillary deposition of C3 or accumulation of polymorphonuclear leucocytes (PMN) in the heterologous phase. The C4 deficient (C4d) strain developed the same injury as normal Dunkin-Hartley animals. Complement depletion with cobra venom factor, PMN depletion with nitrogen mustard or anti-PMN serum and treatment with antihistamines, aprotinin and indomethacin provided no protection. The relationship between the dose of nephrotoxic antibody and the proteinuria was similar for the &#947;1 and &#947;2 subclasses and the F(ab&#8217;)2 fragment of &#947;1 antibody. However, the F(ab&#8217;) and the F(ab) antibody fragments, though fixing on the GBM did not cause proteinuria. It is Concluded that the development of proteinuria in this system: is largely independent of the C/PMN system; is due to the fixation of the F(ab&#8217;)2 fragment of the antibody molecule; and does not depend on an intact Fc piece. In the autologous phase of NTN induced by sheep antibody to GBM in DH and C4d strain gp, &lt;50% of animals developed proteinuria at the height of the autologous antibody response despite high anti-sheep immunoglobulin titres and fixation of the gp IgG and complement in the kidneys. Only 2 of 37 animals (5.4%) developed progressive disease. In a passive model of autologous phase injury using high titre rabbit antibody to sheep IgG, proteinuria failed to occur despite fixation of up to 95&#181;g of rabbit antibody per kidney. Repeated injection of sheep nephrotoxic antibody caused a persisting nephritic syndrome but not the characteristic proliferative lesion of anti-GBM diseases in other species. Because antibody responses to the alternative complement pathway activator cobra venom factor, are T-dependent and B-mice therefore do not develop resistance to its action it was possible to examine whether renal injury occured under circumstances of protracted alternative pathway activation. After periods of up to three months, no evidence from measurements of blood urea or proteinuria or from examination with light microscopy, immunofluorescent or electron microscopy was obtained to indicate a direct nephrotoxic effect of this type of complement activation. These studies do not support the concept that glomerular injury in patients with mesangiocapillary glomerulonephritis and hypocomplementaemia from C3 nephritic factor are due to the continued activation of the alternative pathway. The clinical course and levels of anti-GBM antibody were compared in 20 patients with Goodpasture&#8217;s syndrome treated with plasma exchange and immunosuppression (8 patients), immunosuppression alone (4patients) or no specific therapy (8 patients). There was a more rapid fall in the level of anti-GBM antibody and pulmonary haemorrhage was less protracted in the patients treated with plasma exchange and immunosuppression. In this group, one patient who presented with severe renal failure showed a marked improvement in renal function and there was no progression of disease in the four with milder renal involvement. Two of the four patients treated with immunosuppression alone and only two of the eight patients who received no specific therapy maintained normal renal function. In the group which received no specific therapy, one of the six patients who progressed to renal failure had mild renal involvement initially. There was a significant correlation between the level of anti-GBM antibody and the severity of the morphological changes seen at renal biopsy but not between the level of anti-GBM antibody and the severity of lung haemorrhage. The course and outcome of the disease in these patients not treated or treated with immunosuppression alone was better than that described in earlier reports of this disease, while those patients with plasma exchange and immunosuppression fared even better. An adequately stratified controled trial of immunosuppression in plasma exchange versus immunsuppression alone is justified. Immune complex (IC) levels were measured in normal subjects using the C1q solid phase, C1q deviation, C1q binding and polyethylene glycol precipitation assays. Significant changes in IC levels were seen in normals with each of the assays but the pattern of variation was not consistent between assays or subjects or in the same subject from day to day. There were no consistent changes with meals, time of day, exercise or the prior administration of prednisone. Low levels of IC appeared to be normal in plasma, but the variation in IC levels was not explained. Normal IC may well comprise mixtures of non-specific immunoglobulin aggregates, rheumatoid factor-immunoglobulin complexes, idiotype anti-idiotype complexes as well as specific antibody complexes with antigens from food, infective agents and other sources. Eighty-six patients with primary glomerulonephritis had circulating IC levels measured in 4 IC assays at the time of percutaneous renal biopsy. Patients with acute glomerulonephritis and type 1 mesangiocapillary glomerulonephritis showed the greatest positivity rate overall while patients with membranous glomerulonephritis had the lowest rate. overall, just over half the patients with primary glomerulonephritis were positive in any one assay and &lt;5% in any three assays. Repeat samples taken from the same patients after an interval of some months often showed the same pattern of reactivity in the 4 assays or a return towards lower values. Thirty-one patients with proven acute myocardial infarction (MI) were studied prospectively at the time of admission to hospital and at 3, 7, and 18 days using 4 IC assays. Each assay showed an increased incidence of IC activity in MI with 76% of patients being Positive in at least one assay on one or more of the sampling days. A positive IC assay did not show a significant correlation with cardiac failure, pericarditis, post MI syndrome or previous infarction. The presence of IC was found to correlate with serum C-reactive protein (CRP), serum enzymes and ESR and suggested that complexed CRP or other acute phase proteins may account for some of the IC activity found with less specific assays. The measurement of IC levels in MI has not proved helpful in the diagnosis, management or prediction of outcome in this disorder. In recipients of cadaveric renal transplants circulating IC as detected by the C1q deviation test were found in more than two thirds of patients with recent graft. IC levels were found to rise after rejection episodes and also after episodes of infection. Low or rapidly falling IC levels soon after transplantation were associated with good graft function. Sera from 4 patients with systemic lupus erythematosis (SLE) were shown to contain abnormal lipoproteins which behaved as IC. One IC lipoprotein (ICVLDL) had the density in ultracentrifugation of very low density lipoprotein, but a markedly altered electrophoretic mobility. A second IC lipoprotein (ICIDL) had the electrophoretic mobility of very low density lipoprotein but was slightly denser than low density lipoprotein on ultracentrifugation. Both the ICVLDL and ICLDL contained IgG and behaved as IC in the C1q deviation test, platelet aggregation and rheumatoid factor inhibition assays, but not in the conglutinin and C1q binding assays and the C1q solid phase assays. These differences could be due to the low densities of the ICVLDL and ICLDL. The abnormal lipoprotein IC disappeared with clinical remission in two patients and were not present in the sera of other patients with inactive or mild SLE, type 4 hyperlipidaemia or during prednisone therapy or plasma exchange for other conditions. These IC appeared to be markers of severe and active SLE.</field><field name="date">1984</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::320100 Medicine-General</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5503</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Pathogenesis and treatment of glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis</field><field name="creator">Reid, IR(Ian Reginald)</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">1988</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::320100 Medicine-General</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5505</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Body protein loss in preoperative patients : the assessment of its impact on physiologic function and surgical risk</field><field name="creator">Windsor, John Albert</field><field name="description">The nutritional assessment of patients awaiting major abdominal surgery is important. It has been shown that malnutrition is common in such patients, but is often unrecognized. Because of the widespread availability of safe forms of nutritional therapy the task of identifying patients who warrant this therapy has become more urgent. However, current techniques used for the identification of significantly malnourished surgical patients have several important limitations. It has become increasingly evident that a fresh approach to nutritional assessement is now required. Drawing on some preliminary evidence that the loss of body protein is associated with an impairment of a range of physiologic functions, this thesis asserts that in order to improve on our ability to identify preoperative patients who are at a significantly increased risk of postoperative morbidiy and mortality because of the loss of body protein, it would be necessary to assess physiologic functions that can be easily measured, are protein dependent, and clinically relevant. Therefore, the following concept was investigated: That patients lose weight in response to disease and/or nutrient deprivation and the important component of this loss is body protein. The loss of body protein results in an impairment of important physiologic functions, which is the basis of the increased surgical risk noted in malnourished patients, and which results in the increased morbidity and mortality after major surgery. In order to investigate the inter&#173;relationships of weight loss, protein loss, impaired function and surgical risk several objective measurement techniques had to be developed in order to measure physiologic functions (respiratory function, liver function, skeletal muscle function, wound healing reaponse and psychological function). An in vivo neutron activation analysis facility was available for the direct measurement of body protein status. In addition, techniques for the clinical assessment of nutritional status, diet, and postoperative course were developed. The fundemental conclusions of these clinical studies were: [1] that the measurement of preoperative weight loss is no longer useful in identifying patients who are at an increased risk of dying following major surgery, [2] that the preoperative loss of body protein is associated with an increased postoperative morbidity and mortality, [3] that the loss of body protein is associated with an impairment of clinically relevant physiologic functions including liver, skeletal muscle and respiratory function, [4] that a proportion (20 to 25%) of body protein can be determined and must be lost before there is an impairment of some important physiologic functions, [5] that plasma transferrin and prealbumin concentrations are sensitive to the adequacy of recent food intake, and are a measure of body protein status in the elective patients studied, [6] that plasma albumin concentration, in the elective patients studied, is sensitive to the adequacy of recent food intake, but does not reflect body protein status, [7] that voluntary grip strength is a practical and sensitive measure of the extent of body protein loss, [8] that body protein loss is an important, and hitherto unrecognized risk factor for postoperative pneumonia because of its impact on respiratory function [9] that the wound healing response is sensitive to the adequacy of recent food intake but not to body protein status, and [10] that a clinical assessment of weight loss, wasting and physiologic function can be objectively validated and can identify preoperative patients at an increased risk of postoperative morbidity and mortality. There are several important implications of these studies. The future direction of nutritional assessment will be the refinement of a clinical method that incorporates an assessment of physiologic function. Further study is required to demonstrate that nutritional therapy is able to reverse the impairment of clinically relevant physiologic functions and to demonstrate that such an improvement translates into a decrease in postoperative morbidity and mortality. It may be that specific defects due to Protein loss and responsible for the impairment of function can be identified and treated with shortterm nutritional therapy. The method of clinical assessment developed in this thesis can used be used to select preoperative patients for nutritional therapy and predict the likely efficacy of such therapy.</field><field name="date">1988</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::320100 Medicine-General</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5506</field></doc><doc><field name="title">CI-921 : a clinical, pharmacokinetic and metabolic study of a potential new cytotoxic agent</field><field name="creator">Hardy, Janet Rea</field><field name="description">CI-921, an analogue of the antileukaemic agent amsacrine, was produced in an attempt to develop a cytotoxic agent with a broader spectrum of activity. CI-921 was selected for clinical trial on the basis of superior in vivo and in vitro solid tumour activity. Sixteen patients with histologically documented cancer for which there was no conventional cytotoxic treatment were entered into a phase I trial. The dose of CI-921 was escalated from 39mg/m2 to 810mg/m2 (total dose divided over 3 days) and repeated 3 weekly. Neutropenia was the major dose limiting toxicity and defined a maximum tolerated dose of 810 mg/m2. Pharmacokinetic studies revealed a biexponential pattern of drug distribution with a distribution half-life of 2.6 h. The kinetics appeared linear over the dose range tested. Less than 1% of total drug was excreted in the urine. Nineteen patients were entered into a limited phase II trial in non-small cell lung cancer using CI-921 at a dose of 648 mg/m2 in the same 3-day schedule. One of the 16 evaluable patients achieved a partial response lasting five months. Myelosuppression was the predominant toxicity as in the phase I trial, but the degree of toxicity confirmed this dose as being suitable for further phase II trials. One patient had a grand mal seizure temporally associated with three of four courses of CI-927 raising the possibility of neurotoxicity. Although drug-induced cardiotoxicity has been reported with the parent drug amsacrine, there was no evidence of this in the current study. It has been suggested that CI-921 undergoes hepatic metabolism and biliary excretion following conjugation with glutathione. There was no fall in whole blood glutathione levels in patients following CI-921 infusion, although a transient decrease in mouse hepatic GSH was demonstrated following both amsacrine and CI-921. The toxicity of CI-921 in mice was markedly increased following depletion of hepatic glutathione with BSO but was not affected by pre-treatment with morphine or the glutathione "protector" N-acetyl cysteine.</field><field name="date">1989</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::320100 Medicine-General</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5507</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies of malnutrition in patients with inflammatory bowel disease</field><field name="creator">Christie, Peter Michael</field><field name="description">Patients suffering from Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) as a group uniformly suffer from nutritional problems. Nevertheless the extent, severity and clinical significance of Protein Energy Malnutrition (PEM) in the various clinical presentations of these diseases remains unclear. In particular little is known of the nutritional status of the ambulatory patient with IBD. Confusion still exists over the long term nutritional changes following colectomy for colitis. Whether intravenous nutrition (IVN) should be prescribed in patients admitted to hospital for acute exacerbations of IBD still remains contentious. Recent work suggests that the significance of PEM relates to the associated impairments seen in various organ systems eg., impaired respiratory muscle function. Furthermore, there is other data to suggest that nutritional therapy may result in improvement in some of these physiological functions long before there is any measured change in the patient&#8217;s nutritional status. Through direct measurements of Body Composition (by neutron activation analysis in conjunction with tritium dilution) together with tests of physiological function (hepatosecretory proteins, skeletal muscle function, respiratory muscle function, wound healing and psychological function) work has been directed to clarify the following clinical questions:- 1. How extensive is the problem of protein depletion in the various clinical presentations of IBD? 2. What are the long term changes in body composition following surgery for colitis? and what is the nature of this restorative process. Is there a return to normal body composition? and if so, What is the duration of this recovery process? 3. What are the effects of a short course of IVN in patients suffering severe exacerbations of IBD? The results of these clinical studies have reaffirmed the high incidence of PEM in patients suffering from acute exacerbations of IBD, furthermore this work has established the existence of persisting protein deficits in the ambulatory patient with IBD who is in clinical remission. Contrary to previous reports, fully convalescent patients following surgery for colitis, were found to have normal body stores of protein and water. The timing of this restorative process was found however to take many months. A 2 week course of IVN was found not only to prevent further loss of body protein in a group of patients presenting with severe exacerbations of IBD, but also within a few days (4 days) lead to a significant improvement in hepatosecretory function, respiratory muscle function, skeletal muscle function, wound healing and psychological function. The magnitudes of these improvements although not complete was probably significant clinically. Following these early improvements, subsequent improvement was slow over many months and was dependent on an increase in body stores of protein.</field><field name="date">1990</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::320100 Medicine-General</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5508</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Molecular analysis of the endoflagella of the pathogenic treponemes</field><field name="creator">Isaacs, Robin David</field><field name="description">1. Motility of Treponema pallidum is mediated by endoflagella located within the periplasmic space. The endoflagella comprise a core surrounded by a sheath, with the sheath being composed of a 37-kD antigen (FlaA). 2. Treponemal endoflagella were isolated and component proteins were purified by reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis was performed using the sheath protein and two core proteins from T. pallidum subsp. pallidum, T. pallidum subsp. pertenue, and T. phagedenis. For all three proteins, the N-terminal sequences found for T. pallidum and T. pertenue were identical but differed from the sequence of T. phagedenis. The sheath proteins from the three treponemes were also compared by HPLC tryptic peptide maps: maps for T. pallidum and T. pertenue were very similar but differed from T. phagedenis. 3. A &#955;gt11 clone, &#955;A34, that expressed a portion of FlaA was selected from a T. pallidum genomic library using a murine monoclonal antibody. The insert from &#955;A34 provided a probe with which a chimeric plasmid, pRI4, encoding all but the nine N-terminal amino acids of FlaA was selected from a pBR322 T. pallidum genomic library. 4. The nucleotide sequence of flaA upstream of amino acid 10 could not be determined by routine cloning strategies. Instead, the remaining sequence was determined using the inverse- and asymmetric-polymerase chain reaction methods. flaA contains a consensus Escherichia coli promoter and a ribosome binding site. A single open reading frame encodes a precursor protein, pre-FlaA, of 350 amino acids with a calculated Mr 38,860. A 20 amino acid signal sequence with a typical signal peptidase I cleavage site immediately precedes the known N-terminus of FlaA. Twenty six per cent (91/350) of the DNA-derived amino acid sequence was confirmed by N-terminal sequence analysis of ten tryptic peptides derived from native FlaA. 5. Polymerase chain reaction-derived constructs lacking the native T. pallidum promoter were cloned downstream of a T7 promoter. T7 polymerase transcription was under the control of a PL &#955; promoter. When the &#955; repressor was inactivated at 42&#176;C, FlaA was expressed at relatively low levels in E. coli. Native and recombinant FlaA were identical as assessed by antibody reactivity and electrophoretic mobility in both sodium dodecyl sulphate- and two dimensional-polyacrylamide gels. 6. Although some pre-FlaA is processed to FlaA in E. coli, pre-FlaA is accumulated indicating inefficient processing of pre-FlaA in E. coli. Soluble FlaA was not detected in either the cytoplasmic or the periplasmic fractions of E. coli transformants. Fractionation of E. coli cell envelopes unexpectedly revealed that pre-FlaA and FlaA were associated with both the inner and outer membranes. 7. Two gene fusions, cro-lacZ-flaA and lacZ&#8217;-flaA, were constructed in an attempt to increase expression of the recombinant antigen; a bovine protease Xa site was engineered into the hybrid proteins immediately upstream of the N-terminus of FlaA to allow for subsequent proteolytic cleavage of the purified hybrid proteins. The LacZ&#8217;-FlaA protein was expressed in E. coli in increased amounts as compared with FlaA, but like recombinant FlaA, associated with both the inner and outer bacterial membranes. LacZ&#8217;-FlaA can be released from the membranes by treatment with 1% [wt/vol] sarkosyl, 6 M urea, or 6 M guanidine hydrochloride.</field><field name="date">1991</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::320100 Medicine-General</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5511</field></doc><doc><field name="title">In vivo isotopic studies of the metabolic effects of recombinant human growth hormone and insulin-like growth factors I and II</field><field name="creator">Douglas, Richard George</field><field name="description">The continued loss of protein from patients with severe sepsis, trauma or cancer cachexia, which occurs despite the provision of adequate calories and nitrogen, remains a challenge for surgeons and intensivists involved in their care. Prolonged loss of protein may impair cardiopulmonary and immune function and wound healing, and so its effective treatment may represent a considerable clinical advance. In this thesis, studies have been performed in both Patients and laboratory animals which investigate the potential of human growth hormone and insulin-like growth factors to slow or reverse the accelerated protein catabolism associated with severe surgical illness. In the patient studies, the following issues have been addressed: i) The effects of a short course of recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) on the rate of net protein loss, whole body protein turnover, glucose kinetics, free fatty acid and glycerol concentrations and total carbohydrate and fat oxidation have been measured in septic and injured patients in both postabsorptive and parenterally fed states. ii) The effects of a short course of recombinant human growth hormone on the rate of protein synthesis has been determined in tissues removed from patients with cancer. In the animal studies the following issues have been addressed; i)The effects of acute infusions of recombinant human insulin-like growth factor I (rhIGF-I) on the rate of net protein loss, whole body protein turnover, tissue protein synthesis, glucose kinetics and free fatty acid and glycerol concentrations have been measured. The actions of rhIGF-I infusion were then compared to those of an insulin infusion of equivalent hypoglycaemic potential and to an equimolar infusion of recombinant human insulin-like growth factor II (rhIGF-II). ii) The difficulty in achieving nitrogen accretion in patients with critical surgical illness or cancer cachexia may result from metabolic derangements caused by release of inflammatory mediators such as tumour necrosis factor (TNF). In order to determine whether recombinant human insulin-like growth factor I (rhIGF-I) preserved its protein sparing effects in the face of high plasma TNF concentrations, rhIGF-I was infused into lambs which were simultaneously receiving infusions of recombinant human tumour necrosis factor (rhTNF), and the change in the rate of net protein loss compared to control animals who received rhIGF-I alone. The major findings of the human studies were as follows: i) In parenterally fed patients, rhGH treatment almost halved the rate of net protein loss, although a positive nitrogen balance was not achieved. The rate of whole body protein turnover was not altered, suggesting that the reduction in net protein loss was due to an increase in the rate of protein synthesis rather than reduced catabolism. In the post absorptive group, rhGH treatment increased the rate of appearance and oxidation of free fatty acids and reduced the rate of protein oxidation, from which it was concluded that fat was being oxidized in preference to protein. ii) The rate of protein synthesis in skeletal muscle tissue removed from patients with cancer undergoing resection to whom a short course of rhGH had been administered was significantly greater than that of a matched group of control patients, however the rate of protein synthesis in the tumour per se was not increased. It appears that rhGH favourably alters host tissue protein kinetics without accelerating the rate of tumour protein synthesis. The important results from the animal studies were as follows: i) Infusion of rhIGF-I reduced the rate of net protein loss by both increasing the rate of protein synthesis and reducing the rate of protein catabolism. The rate of protein synthesis was increased by a greater extent in the heart and in the diaphragm than in other skeletal muscles. High rates of rhIGF-I infusion which saturated the plasma IGF-I binding capacity lowered the blood glucose concentration by enhancing peripheral glucose uptake. Infusion of an equimolar dose of rhIGF-II did not influence protein kinetics but did result in a small increase in the rate of glucose clearance. Insulin infused at a dose which resulted in the same degree of hypoglycaemia as the rhIGF-I infusion caused a similar reduction in the rate of net protein loss but did not accelerate the rate of protein synthesis in any of the tissues examined. ii) Recombinant human TNF infusion resulted in pyrexia and increased the plasma glucose, cortisol, glucagon and insulin concentrations. The reduction in the rate of net protein loss following rhIGF-I infusion in rhTNF infused lambs was identical to that seen in control animals infused with rhIGF-I alone. We conclude that as rhIGF-I preserves its protein anabolic action in the face of high rhTNF levels, further investigation into a possible clinical role for rhIGF-I in severe surgical illness is warranted. In general terms, these studies demonstrate that rhGH administration to septic or injured patients significantly reduces their rate of loss of protein, and that rhIGF-I infusion similarly conserves protein in an animal model of sepsis. These findings present the challenge to determine whether the favourable changes in protein kinetics brought about by the administration of anabolic peptide hormones will realize tangible improvements in the clinical course of severely ill surgical patients.</field><field name="date">1991</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::320100 Medicine-General</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5512</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Pharmacology of morphine and the active metabolite morphine 6-glucuronide : a comparison of pharmacological and clinical effects</field><field name="creator">Thompson, Paul Ivan</field><field name="description">Morphine is an effective potent analgesic. However the side effects of nausea, constipation and sedation are seen frequently. Respiratory depression is not such a common problem clinically but is the most potentially dangerous toxicity. An analgesic inducing equivalent analgesic potency without these toxicities would be particularly valuable. Morphine 6-glucuronide (M6G), one of the major metabolites of morphine, has analgesic activity in animals and animal studies have suggested an improved therapeutic index. The initial study in this thesis confirms the analgesic activity of M6G in man and the pharmacokinetic profile after intravenous and oral administration has been determined. The elimination half life is approximately 1.6 hours with the rate of clearance closely correlating with creatinine clearance. Oral bioavailability at approximately 5%, however, is poor due to its hydrophilic nature. In an effort to more critically examine the comparative emetic potency of M6G and morphine, both compounds were administered to the ferret, a known emetic model for man. Surprisingly M6G had a greater emetic potency in this model. A pilot pharmacokinetic study performed on the ferret revealed that M6G is only a very minor metabolite accounting for approximately only 1% of the metabolic product of morphine compared to 10% in man. It is possible that other aspects of opiate handling are also different, and reminds us of the importance in studying the drug handling of any animal model used for the testing of any drug, particularly when metabolites are thought to play a role in clinical effect. No patients or volunteers in the initial open studies in man experienced any nausea or sedation. This observation prompted a double-blind randomized study comparing the analgesic potency, respiratory depression, nausea and sedation induced by morphine and M6G in normal volunteers. This study confirmed that M6G has an increased analgesic potency in man when compared to morphine and causes significanctly less respiratory depression, nausea and sedation. It has been previously hypothesized that the &#181; opioid receptor with lower affinity for morphine, the &#181;2 receptor, is responsible for the majority of morphine toxic side-effects, including respiratory depression. The last study presented in this thesis utilises radioligand binding studies to determine the opioid receptor binding affinities of morphine and M6G at the &#181;1, &#181;2, total &#181; and delta opioid receptors. This reveals that M6G has a 5-fold lower binding affinity to the putative &#181;2 opioid receptor and hence provides a possible explanation for the decreased toxicity seen compared to morphine. In light of the findings in man above, further investigation of this active morphine metabolite is therefore indicated as M6G could prove particularly beneficial to those patients with severe underlying pulmonary disease and for obstetric use.</field><field name="date">1991</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::320100 Medicine-General</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5513</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Epidemiology of asthma and bronchial hyperresponsiveness in Auckland children</field><field name="creator">Pattemore, Philip Keith</field><field name="description">Restricted Item. Print thesis available in the University of Auckland Library or available through Inter-Library Loan. In New Zealand (NZ) asthma mortality rates are higher than in any other developed country studied, and hospital admission rates for asthma are among the highest. Within NZ, both mortality and hospital admission rates for asthma are higher among Polynesians than among Europeans. To investigate the possibility that these differences were due to differences in asthma prevalence, a study was initiated to measure the prevalence and severity of asthma among both Europeans and Polynesians in Auckland using methods identical to those used in an overseas study. From all primary schools in the Auckland Urban Area, classes were sampled by two-stage, random, stratified sampling. In the winter of 1985, the children in the sampled classes were studied employing a questionnaire and a rapid, portable method of bronchial challenge testing with histamine which had been used to study schoolchildren aged 8 to 10 years in two areas in New South Wales (NSW), Australia. Participation was 83%, the participants comprising 1084 European, 509 Maori, and 460 Pacific Island children, who were closely matched in gender and age to the NSW children. Prevalence of various items was compared including asthma symptoms, diagnosed asthma, and bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR), defined as a 20% fall in the one-second forced expiratory volume (FEV1), on or before the administration of a cumulative dose of 7.8 &#181;mol histamine. The prevalence rates of respiratory symptoms, BHR, severe BHR and BHR combined with symptoms were similar among the 1084 Auckland European children and 769 inland NSW children, but lower among 718 coastal NSW children than the other two sites. In Auckland, the prevalence of respiratory symptoms was higher in Maoris than among Europeans or Pacific Islanders, whereas prevalence of diagnosed asthma was similar in all three groups. Europeans had the highest rate of BHR and severe BHR followed by Maoris then Pacific Islanders. Maori and Pacific Island children reporting symptoms were less likely to receive prophylactic medication than European children. The study design also enabled assessment of the epidemiological correlates of BHR, which had been little studied in random populations before 1985. Among the Auckland children, bronchial responsiveness was found to be unimodally distributed, with no clear separation between children with a diagnosis or symptoms of asthma and those without. The presence or absence of BHR did not accurately identify children with a diagnosis or symptoms of asthma. A l4-variable multiple logistic regression model was developed which explained 27% of the variability in BHR rates. The main variables independently increasing BHR risk were: low baseline FEV1, a history of wheeze, diagnosed asthma, atopic conditions, or bronchodilator treatment, and European (as opposed to Polynesian) ethnicity. Climatic conditions at the time of the test were less strongly associated. In summary, neither the international nor the inter-ethnic differences in asthma mortality and asthma admission rates were adequately explained by differences in the prevalence of asthma symptoms, diagnosed asthma or BHR; however, differences in asthma severity and in the management of asthma may be contributory. In this large population-based study of children, BHR was associated independently with a number of different variables but did not precisely identify children reporting asthma symptoms or a diagnosis of asthma. Thus a single bronchial challenge test is not an ideal tool on its own for diagnosing asthma or measuring asthma prevalence.</field><field name="date">1991</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::320100 Medicine-General</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5514</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Epidemiology of motor neuron disease in Scotland, 1989-90 : a prospective study of incidence, clinical features and prognosis, and incorporating a case control study of antecedent environmental factors</field><field name="creator">Chancellor, Andrew Martin</field><field name="description">Chapter 1 The part that 19th century Edinburgh medicine played in formulating the early concepts of motor neuron disease as a nosological entity is described, including some hitherto unrecognized descriptions by graduates of Edinburgh Medical School, including the first description of progressive bulbar palsy. Credit is given to the great European neurologists, especially charcot&#8217;s landmark contribution of the definitive clinico-pathological correlations. Terminology relating to MND is discussed and the problems which have arisen over the nosology relating to diseases of motor neurons. The requirement for a clearly defined classification system and the importance of measuring incidence in this disease are outlined. Chapter 2 A comprehensive review of previous studies of incidence, mortality and distribution is presented. It is suggested that the value of previous clinical descriptions and epidemiological studies of motor neuron disease (MND) have been limited by methodological problems. There appears to have been a real increase in mortality from MND over recent decades. Comparison of incidence in different places is complicated by non standardised methods of case-ascertainment and diagnosis but evidence is presented which challenges the traditional concept that the distribution of MND in developed countries is uniform and static. It remains uncertain, from the evidence available, if age specific incidence continues to rise into old age and the apparent &#8220;peak&#8221; in late-middle life is due to ascertainment bias. This is an important consideration on which to base aetiological hypotheses. In the northern hemisphere there is a weak positive correlation between standardised, age specific incidence and distance from the equator. There is a high prevalence focus of an atypical MND/ALS on Guam, and while an environmental factor is probably responsible, its nature is uncertain. The relevance of other reported clusters of MND is discussed and the requirements for the ideal study of MND incidence are outlined, which acted as the impetus for the Scottish Motor Neuron Disease Register (SMNDR). Chapter 3 The methodology of the SMNDR is described. This is the first collaborative, population based, prospective, epidemiological study of MND and illustrates the feasibility of such a study and the way in which Scotland is suited (in terms of size and National Health service structure) to such a project. Diagnostic criteria are outlined for application to this and other large scale studies. Of 257 patients registered with the SMNDR as possible MND diagnosed in 1989 and 1990 in Scotland, 229 with proven (by autopsy), clinically definite or probable, sporadic or familial MND, form the basis of the description of incidence, distribution, clinical features and natural history contained in this chapter. The crude incidence was 2.24/100,000/year and age specific incidence continued to rise steeply with age into the very elderly age bands. No evidence for clustering on the basis of Scottish regions was found. 5% of patients had a family history of MND; the clinical pattern varied according to sex and age, with elderly women most likely to present with, or develop, progressive bulbar palsy. Chapter 4 The utility of the 1989-90 Scottish Hospital In-patient statistics (SHIPS) and 1989-90 death certificate coding (Registrar General for Scotland) by International classification of Diseases (ICD)-9, 335 (MND) are analysed as a tool for epidemiological studies and heath care planning. Coded hospital discharge data were an inaccurate record of a diagnosis of MND with a positive predictive value of a diagnosis of MND as determined by SHIPS of 70%. Such data cannot, in their present form, be used as a reliable measure of incidence in Scotland. Greater care is required in the preparation of summaries and coding if these data are to be useful care planning and epidemiological research. However, as an important source of case notification for the SMNDR to achieve a complete sample of patients. There was also a problematic false positive rate (10%) for mortality data but this source more closely approximated true incidence. Chapter 5 A review of previous case control studies of environmental risks for MND is presented. In order to test the hypothesis that certain environmental factors may play a role in the aetiology of MND, a case control study of 103 incident patients (diagnosis date May 1990-october 1991; 57 from the above cohort (as described in chapter 3) and 46 diagnosed in 1991, age and sex matched with community controls was conducted and is described. Measures were taken to minimise potential sources of bias and these are discussed. Fractures were more common in patients than controls especially in the in the five years prior to symptom onset (odds ratio = 15 (95% CI, 2.3-654). Manual workers were over represented and a number of environmental exposures of potential toxicity including exposure to lead (OR = 5.3, 95% CI, 1.5-11) and solvents or chemicals (OR = 3.8, 95% CI 1.5-11) were found. The limited extent of these associations favours a multifactorial aetiology for MND. No relationship to social class, poliovirus infection or to factors which might increase the risk of enteroviral infection in childhood (home space and domestic amenities) was found. Chapter 6 A comprehensive review of previous prognostic studies in MND is presented. An actuarial analysis of the survival of the cohort of 229 incident patients (57 seen in person) in Scotland in 1989-90, with complete follow up for a mean of two years from diagnosis, is calculated on the basis of the SMNDR clinical classification system. The overall 50% survival from diagnosis was 1.2 years (95% CI, 1.0-1.4) and from symptom onset, 2.5 years (95% CI, 2.2-3.0 years). There were significant differences in survival with a poorer prognosis for: progressive bulbar palsy (PBP), female sex and age &gt; 65 years. The presence of PBP and old age were the strongest predictors of outcome, the difference in survival between the sexes was due to the higher frequency of PBP in females. The overall five year survival from symptom onset was 27.7% (95% CI, 19.9-36.0%) but for patients with PBP as the presenting feature was only 3.5% (95% CI, 0.0-15%). These results suggest that, in well defined cohorts, survival can be predicted with some confidence and are useful for the planning of treatment trials.

The syndrome is the leading cause of maternal mortality in the United Kingdom and it also contributes significantly to perinatal morbidity and mortality. Maternal mortality is primarily due to cerebral complications. Despite continued research, the aetiology of preeclampsia remains unknown. This has limited the development of screening, preventive and therapeutic measures to control the syndrome. Present management is based on basic screening to detect early signs of the syndrome, observation of its progress and occasionally therapeutic intervention to control hypertension. Delivery is timed to prevent maternal and fetal complications, while simultaneously aiming to gain fetal maturity. Unfortunately, in many situations this control is not possible. Owing to an increasing understanding of the pathogenesis of the disease, a new option for prophylaxis - low-dose aspirin - may soon be available. If prevention of preeclampsia becomes a reality, a simple but sensitive screening test will be required to select those women who will benefit from treatment. This thesis is focused on the prevention of preeclampsia and its complications. It will involve examination of screening tests, the preventive therapy low-dose aspirin, and the preliminary assessment of a new technique to detect women at risk for developing cerebral complications from the disease.</field><field name="date">1993</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::320100 Medicine-General</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5519</field></doc><doc><field name="title">EGF and PDGF receptors in endometrial cancer</field><field name="creator">Davis, Gregory Keith</field><field name="description">Despite its relatively good long term survival compared to other cancers in the female, endometrial carcinoma still kills 20% of those women who develop the disease worldwide. Abnormalities in growth factor receptors have been shown to be important in both the prognosis and probably the malignant transformation of the two other oestrogen-dependent cancers, breast and ovary, which suggests that similar defects may occur in endometrial cancer. In this thesis, two of these growth factor receptors, those for the epidermal and platelet-derived growth factors, are studied in endometrial cancer at the levels of the gene and expression of the proteins on the cell surface, in an attempt to detect abnormalities which might be implicated in carcinogenesis. No amplification or rearrangement of the EGFR gene was detected on 13 tumour samples initially, or of the EGF, PDGF &#945;- and &#946;-subunit receptor genes subsequently on a mixture of tumour samples and cell from endometrial cancer cell lines. The size of the EGF and PDGF receptor proteins and the activation of their tyrosine kinase domains was assessed in an oestrogen responsive (Ishikawa) and an oestrogen independent (HEC-1-A) endometrial cancer cell line. Functioning receptors for EGF were demonstrated in both cell lines but no PDGF receptors were detected. EGF-binding studies were carried out and appropriate affinity constants and receptor numbers obtained in both cell lines. The growth of Ishikawa and HEC-1-A cells in culture was studied but because of the rapid growth of both lines in the absence of serum no meaningful mitogenic effects were shown by any growth factor or steroid. Phorbol ester and TGF-&#946; inhibited the growth of HEC-1-A and Ishikawa cells, respectively. Of particular interest was that, despite the reported sensitivity of Ishikawa cells to oestrogen, no consistent stimulation was observed. The growth of both cell lines in the absence of serum suggested that the cells might be secreting growth factors and conditioned medium was obtained from long term, large scale cultures. The medium was concentrated and passed through a size exclusion column and the fractions assayed for DNA synthesis and competition for EGF-binding to Swiss 3T3 cells. No consistent effect on either of these assays was shown and no further investigation was undertaken.</field><field name="date">1993</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::320100 Medicine-General</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5520</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Metabolic effects of proinflammatory cytokines</field><field name="creator">Hill, Andrew Graham</field><field name="description">The metabolic responses to trauma are well characterized and there is growing evidence supporting an important role for cytokines in its pathogenesis. Interleukin-1 (IL-1), Interleukin-6 (IL-6), and Tumour necrosis factor (TNF) are synthesized in the brain, and other tissues, in trauma. In order to test the hypothesis that these cytokines play an important role in the metabolic responses associated with trauma, the effects of chronic cerebroventricular and peripheral infusions of IL-1, IL-6, and TNF on protein metabolism, weight loss, anorexia, and pyrexia in Sprague-Dawley rats were examined. Specifically the aims of these investigations were: 1. To examine the effect of chronic central nervous system exposure to the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1, IL-6, and TNF. 2. To investigate the role of anorexia in the catabolic responses to centrally infused IL-1. 3. To investigate the effects of IL-1 on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. 4. To investigate the role of glucocorticoids in the metabolic effects produced by chronic central infusion of IL-1. 5. To examine the metabolic effects of increasing doses of chronic peripherally infused IL-1 and to distinguish between those responses mediated centrally and those mediated outside the blood-brain-barrier. The major findings of these studies were: 1. IL-1, but not IL-6 in the same dose, nor TNF in a lower dose, produced net protein catabolism, weight loss, and pyrexia in excess of that produced by anorexia alone. 2. Furthermore the loss of weight and nitrogen did not require sustained elevations of glucocorticoids, as IL-1 infusion in corticosterone-replaced, adrenalectomized rats resulted in similar losses of weight and nitrogen as observed in sham-adrenalectomized animals infused with IL-1. 3. Peripheral infusion of increasing doses of IL-1 mimicked the effects of increasing injury with low doses causing a mild acute phase response (as assessed by a fall in serum iron and albumin and a leucocytosis) and larger doses causing net protein catabolism and weight loss. An attempt was made to distinguish between the central and peripherally mediated metabolic effects of IL-1 using a novel model utilizing peripheral infusions of IL-1 and central infusions of IL-1 receptor antagonist. Using this model the data were consistent with the hypotheses that pyrexia is mediated inside and outside the blood-brain barrier and that leucocytosis is mediated by a direct peripheral effect, probably on the bone-marrow. In conclusion, centrally produced IL-1 may play an important role in the metabolic responses associated with trauma and this is in excess of the anorexia and adrenocortical activation produced by centrally acting IL-1. Peripherally produced IL-1 may play a role in various organs such as the bone-marrow and the liver to produce other features of the metabolic responses associated with injury.</field><field name="date">1994</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::320100 Medicine-General</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5522</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Use of low molecular weight proteins in the diagnosis of renal tubular dysfunction in children</field><field name="creator">Tomlinson, Paul Andrew</field><field name="description">Low molecular weight (LMW) proteins pass easily through the glomerular filter and are almost completely reabsorbed by the proximal renal tubule in health. An increase in their urinary excretion implies failure of reabsorption and may signal tubular dysfunction. &#946;2-microglobulin (B2M) is a sensitive marker of tubular dysfunction, but is unstable in acid urine, whilst only limited data are available for other LMW proteins. The aim of these studies was to determine the prevalence of elevated LMW protein excretion in children with renal disease and to identify factors influencing LMW protein excretion. Secondly, these studies sought to determine conditions where individual proteins might best indicate tubular dysfunction. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were used to measure B2M, &#945;1-microglobulin (A1M) and urine protein 1 (UP1) in plasma and urine, and retinol-binding protein (RBP) in urine. Albumin, the lysosomal enzyme N-acetyl-&#946;-D-glucosaminidase (NAG), creatinine and pH were also measured in urine. Each protein excretion was expressed as a ratio to creatinine concentration. B2M showed instability in urine with pH below 6.0, RBP was unstable in urine below pH 5.0 following frozen storage whilst A1M and UP1 were stable at physiological pH. Two groups of apparently healthy children were studied, and normal ranges were established for protein excretion in random and overnight samples. A comparison of B2M, A1M, UP1, RBP and NAG excretion was undertaken in tubular disease and in glomerular disease. A1M, UP1 and NAG were correlated with increasing albumin excretion in steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome, in contrast to B2M and RBP. Compared with A1M, UP1 and NAG, RBP was more closely associated with tubulo-interstitial involvement histologically. There was abnormal RBP excretion in reflux nephropathy, with levels increasing according to the degree of scarring. Increased RBP excretion was also seen in cystic disease, neurogenic bladder, allograft rejection and chronic glomerular disease. RBP excretion was inversely correlated with glomerular filtration rate in reflux nephropathy and in glomerular disease. RBP excretion was increased in diabetic children and was correlated with albumin excretion and with metabolic control. LMW protein excretion is common in children with renal problems, and may be a marker of disease severity. RBP is the most suitable marker of tubular dysfunction.</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::320100 Medicine-General</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5525</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigations into the immunopathology of inflammatory arthritis</field><field name="creator">McQueen, Fiona Marion Florence</field><field name="description">This volume contains an introduction to the topic of inflammatory arthritis, followed by Chapter 2 which is a Materials and Methods section and includes experimental protocols used for the original research detailed in Chapters 3 to 6 (Sections 2.1 - 2.4).

Recently the topic of poor fetal growth has generated considerable research interest, as numerous epidemiological studies have demonstrated that small size at birth is also associated with increased risks of adult cardiovascular diseases and non-insulin dependent diabetes Antenatal treatment aimed at improving fetal growth might therefore reduce perinatal morbidity, as well as later complications of being born small for gestational age (SGA). SGA fetuses with abnormal umbilical artery Doppler studies have placental vascular pathology. Low dose aspirin, which inhibits the production of the powerful vasoconstrictor thromboxane, might therefore increase placental blood flow and fetal growth. The hypothesis in the first antenatal study was that treatment of SGA pregnancies, with abnormal umbilical artery Doppler studies, with aspirin (100 mg) for &#8805;14 days, would increase fetal weight. As perinatal morbidity and mortality are increased in SGA pregnancies most obstetricians advocate a programme of regular fetal surveillance. Outpatient management with twice weekly fetal surveillance has been usual practice in our hospital in uncomplicated SGA pregnancies. These frequent checks may be unnecessary when umbilical artery Doppler studies are normal as the risk of serious perinatal morbidity is low. More conservative management in SGA pregnancies with normal umbilical artery Doppler studies has been suggested by several authors but has only been evaluated in one previous trial, where hospitalisation was usual practice. In the second antenatal study we therefore wished to test the hypothesis that the frequency of fetal surveillance could be reduced from twice weekly to fortnightly, in SGA pregnancies with normal umbilical artery Doppler studies, without increasing maternal or perinatal morbidity. Abnormal umbilical artery Doppler studies have been shown in a number of reports to be associated with increased perinatal mortality and morbidity, in SGA pregnancies. Previous investigators have not considered the potential confounding effects of both gestational age at delivery and birthweight in relation to umbilical artery Doppler status. SGA babies with normal umbilical artery Doppler studies, have a low risk of complications and have been called &#8216;small normal babies&#8217; although there is little data to support this claim. In the third antenatal study the following hypotheses were tested: that abnormal umbilical artery Doppler studies would predict newborn morbidity in SGA babies, independent of birthweight and gestational age; that compared with SGA babies with abnormal umbilical artery Doppler studies, SGA babies with normal umbilical artery Doppler studies would have low rates of newborn morbidity and malnutrition; and that their mothers would be smaller, have different ethnic distribution, and have lower rates of vascular problems in pregnancy than mothers of SGA babies with abnormal umbilical artery Doppler studies. After birth approximately 20% of SGA babies fail to show catchup growth and remain short at two years of age. Persisting short stature has been associated with later psychological difficulties, abnormal neurodevelopmental testing in childhood, poor school performance and hypertension in childhood and adult life. Most catchup growth occurs in the first six months after birth and most children who are small at six months will not show further catchup growth. Early identification of children who will remain small may enable interventions aimed at improving later outcomes. There are no previous reports of the influence of perinatal variables on size at six months. In the first postnatal study in this thesis we therefore chose to investigate the perinatal factors associated with small size at six months of age. We tested the hypotheses that children who were small at six months would: have been diagnosed SGA earlier in pregnancy; be more likely to have abnormal umbilical artery Doppler studies; have smaller body proportions at birth; and be more likely to have normal ponderal indices at birth. Previous studies, mostly of children born in the 1960s and 1970s, have reported more abnormal neurodevelopmental test results in children who were SGA at birth compared with appropriate weight for gestational age children. There are very few published studies of neurodevelopmental outcome in SGA children born in the 1990s, who have had the advantage of recent advances in antenatal and especially newborn care. The aims of the second postnatal study were therefore to: assess neurodevelopmental outcome in a cohort of SGA children at 18 months and compare results to a reference population; determine whether one or more of the following perinatal variables might be predictive of abnormal neurodevelopmental test results: early recognition of SGA antenatally, abnormal antenatal Doppler results, lack of participation in the antenatal studies in SGA pregnancies, gestation at delivery, head size at birth, head growth from birth to six months, and ponderal index at birth.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::320100 Medicine-General</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5528</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Electroencephalographic effects of general anaesthetics : a suite of clinical studies and theoretical models</field><field name="creator">Sleigh, James Wallace</field><field name="description">The primary object of this thesis was to investigate aspects of empirically-measured, anaesthesia-induced electroencephalographic (EEG) changes that could be explained by network models of cortical interactions. The thesis consists of a collection of various theoretical and clinical papers in three sections: (a) A background section summarizing previous relevant published works on the molecular actions of anaesthetic agents, and the origin and problems with the acquisition of the EEG. (b) A second section dealing with the development of various theoretical / computer models of general anaesthetic action. (c) A third section of various clinical and EEG studies of anaesthesia and sleep. These were done to confirm and clarify some of the theoretical results from the models. However there are many different ways of numerically capturing the information contained within the EEG. Because this problem needed to be overcome before the primary aim of the thesis could be accurately handled; the clinical studies tended to be diverted into this secondary "signal-acquisition" aspect of the EEG analysis in anaesthesia and sleep. Because the thesis has a constellation of different interlocking threads of investigation, I have summarized the various themes in the following table. (A) Background Section The relevant conclusions from the background section were: 1) The transition from aesthesia to anaesthesia involved the whole animal, and thus may not be entirely measurable by the EEG. In contrast the transitions from consciousness to coma - and even more specifically - from mnesis to amnesis were predominantly observable by changes in the activity of the cortex and in the resultant EEG signal. 2) The EEG signal arose largely from the summation of coherent post-synaptic potentials in the cortical pyramidal cells. These were, in turn, mainly controlled by cortical layer-l modulation - which was subject to ascending neuromodulatory systems. 3) The main artifacts in the EEG signal were eye-movements, blinks, and frontalis EMG. 4) The Bispectral index (BIS) consisted of three subcomponents. The first two (BetaRatio and SynchFastSlow) probably reflected the loss of high-frequency activity that is associated with the transition from consciousness to unconsciousness. 5) The state of the midbrain reticular formation projecting via the non-specific thalamocortical connections can profoundly alter the oscillatory state of the cortex and thence the EEG. Direct or indirect actions of general anaesthetic agents on these structures may be a major cause of the observed EEG changes. These changes are qualitatively similar to the changes observed during natural sleep. 6) Although there was variation between different agents, the most consistent action of commonly-used general anaesthetic agents was to prolong the fast inhibitory postsynaptic potential&gt; 50% by GABAergic potentiation. This action was consonant with the observed EEG effects of anaesthesia - which are (1) an increase in EEG spectral power and frequency followed by, (2) a decrease in dominant frequency and overall power with increasing concentrations: the so-called "biphasic response" There were also a number of more specific features: namely loss of alpha band activity, an initial increase in relative beta activity, followed by a shift to lower frequencies, spindles - and in deep anaesthesia - burst suppression patterns. Other contributions to anaesthetic action may include: (1) inhibition of NMDA receptor function, (2) reduction of nicotinic acetylcholine modulation, and (3) a direct hyperpolarizing action by opening potassium channels. Anaesthetic agents disrupted cortical function at lower doses than those required for inhibition of brain stem function. (B) Theoretical Models The fact that the cerebral cortex consisted of, effectively, a two-dimensional interconnecting neural network was of overriding importance. All the theoretical models were constrained by this topological fact, and showed a remarkable degree of similarity. Regardless of whether the model was continuous (appendix 2) or discrete (cellular automata), some robust and consistent features emerged: 1) Some form of abrupt decrease in information flow within the network occurred when the interaction between the network elements was interrupted greater than certain critical threshold amount - the order/disorder phase transition. 2) This critical point was manifest as (i) a large change in the simulated mean soma potential (the order parameter), (ii) divergence of the spectral power of the simulated pseudoEEG signal, and (iii) decrease in frequency content (in the cellular automaton models). Unfortunately the order parameter for the EEG is probably unmeasurable in clinical practice. The first derivative is measurable, but not completely reliable as a proxy order parameter. 3) All models required some form of noisy external (subcortical) input to drive them. Variations in this input could explain some of the anomalies observed in the clinical section of the thesis. (C) Clinical Papers The clinical papers were a series of papers recording the clinical data, which then influenced the development of the theoretical models. The single most popular clinical measure of anaesthetic depth in present practice is the Bispectral Index (BIS). Many of these studies explore the strengths and weaknesses of this index in various clinical situations. The main disadvantage of the BIS was that crucial aspects of its formulation are not in the public domain for commercial reasons. We attempted to separate out the changes in the various subcomponents of the BIS in patients under general anaesthesia, and natural sleep. 1) In the first paper we described how the EEG changed during induction and recovery from general anaesthesia with propofol and isoflurane. We compared EEG vs heart rate variability changes as monitors of anaesthetic depth. This study served to evaluate a clinically accepted measure of anaesthetic depth, as well as gaining practical EEG experience in collecting experimental data, both using the ASPECT EEG monitor, and in devising the best clinical methods of quantifying levels of consciousness. The main results were that the BIS was relatively reliable in steady-state conditions, and better than the raw 95% spectral edge frequency, and the approximate entropy of the EEG. 2) Auditory recall and response-to-command during recovery from propofol anaesthesia. In this paper we were able to collect data in a very controlled situation, somewhat different from that pertaining to clinical practice. From this we were able to identify separate components of consciousness and mnesis and how they correlated with EEG changes. We were also able to compare frontal and parietal EEG data. We established that there is a clear divergence of spectral power around the time of loss-of-consciousness when the propofol was administered as a slow infusion. This is good evidence supporting the basis of the theoretical models. This experiment also established that it is possible for a patient to be conscious, not paralyzed, but not responding to verbal command. 3) Electroencephalographic measures of depth of anaesthesia: the importance of the gamma band and the electromyogram signal. This study was concerned with different technical aspects of EEG signal acquisition and processing. It suggested that usually the EMG is not a significant problem, and that the gamma (40-60Hz) frequency band is important in distinguishing the awake from the anaesthetized state. 4) The Bispectral Index: A Measure of Depth of Sleep? Because the EEG changes of general anaesthesia are very similar to those of sleep, this study was a simple observational study collecting some information about changes in the BIS with natural sleep. 5) The Bispectral Index and Sleep Stage: A Polysomnographic study. In this study we formally compared the BIS with a full polysomnogramnographic sleep staging. It confirmed the results of the previous study, and demonstrated that the subcomponents of the BIS (the BetaRatio and the SynchFastSlow) changed in a manner very similar to those observed under general anaesthetic. Conclusions The observed changes in the EEG on induction of anaesthesia can be explained by changes in relatively simple theoretical network models. These changes can be reliably reduced to univariate Parameters</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::320100 Medicine-General</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5530</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Clinical and angiographic outcome following percutaneous coronary intervention</field><field name="creator">Ruygrok, Peter Nicolas</field><field name="description">This volume contains a series of linking chapters that follow the evolution of percutaneous intervention from conventional balloon angioplasty in the early to mid 1990s to stent implantation which has now become standard practice. It describes contributions to the extension of clinical situations in which percutaneous intervention has been found to be efficacious as well as refinements in practice and technique. I was fortunate to have been a fellow and then staff member of the Cardiology department of the Thoraxcenter, Rotterdam from 1993-1995, which was then, and remains, at the forefront of the development of percutaneous coronary interventional techniques. My continued links with the Thoraxcenter as well as new projects have allowed me to continue my research and complete this thesis. Part 1 contains two chapters on balloon angioplasty which was standard clinical practice for suitable obstructive coronary lesions until the mid 1990s. The first chapter describes an audit of immediate clinical outcome and thus rates of procedure related complications of contemporary practice in a high volume unit following 970 balloon angioplasty procedures over a one-year period. Although the rate of adverse events appeared to remain static when compared to the previous decade, the requirement for emergency bypass surgery appeared to be diminishing and it is suggested that may be due to the increasing availability of stents for "bail-out". The second chapter studies the long-term outcome with respect to major adverse clinical events in 856 consecutive patients treated by balloon angioplasty from 1980-1985. Although the long-term outcome was good and comparable to results of coronary bypass surgery, most patients suffered a further cardiac event during the 10 years following balloon angioplasty, most of which were repeat revascularisation. Part 2 contains four chapters that describe and document contributions to the evolution of percutaneous coronary interventional practice from balloon angioplasty to stent implantation. Chapter 1 is a review of the literature that describes the evolution of stenting from early animal experiments through early human studies to current practice and on to a vision of the future. Chapter 2 describes follow-up of patients enrolled in the Benestent I study, which was pivotal to the introduction of stenting into clinical practice. Patients, in many centres world-wide, were randomised to balloon angioplasty or stent implantation and underwent 6-month clinical and angiographic follow-up. We report the extended one-year clinical outcome. Chapter 3 documents the landmark Benestent II study. This was a randomised comparison of 827 patients in many centres worldwide (including Auckland) who were allocated to balloon angioplasty or a heparin-coated stent plus treatment with the anti-platelet agent ticlopidine. Patients randomised to stent implantation suffered fewer adverse events and less restenosis but this treatment was found to be more costly than balloon angioplasty. Chapter 4 analyses in more detail some data from the Benestent II study. As well as being randomised to balloon angioplasty or stent implantation, patients were also sub-randomised to 6 month clinical only or clinical and angiographic follow-up. We therefore set out to assess whether management and outcome were influenced as a result of a follow-up angiogram. We found that more interventions were undertaken in those who underwent angiography with no adverse effect on outcome. As a result of the above and other studies, stenting has become routine clinical practice with most patients (approximately 90%) undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention receiving a stent. Part 3 describes several studies which have expanded our knowledge of stenting in various clinical situations and conditions, and also incorporates studies that have added refinement to the technique of stenting. Chapter 1 studies the intermediate term clinical outcome of stent implantation in degenerated saphenous vein grafts. Although the immediate outcome is good, with respect to adverse clinical events, the long-term benefit is limited indicating that with the available technology and medication percutaneous treatment of vein graft is a palliative procedure. Chapter 2 describes the results of a prospective multicentre study assessing the outcome of stenting long native coronary artery lesions. The rates of restenosis were acceptable. The study also provides us with an opportunity to analyse, using quantitative coronary angiography, the location of and give insights into, the mechanism of the restenosis process. Chapter 3 studies the outcome of stenting smaller coronary arteries. Its unique design, in that patients were required to have a lesion in a "small" and a "large" vessel, has provided us with the opportunity to compare both the rates and nature of the restenosis process in the same patients. In this way we abolished clinical and procedure related variables that confound the results when using historical comparisons. Chapter 4 describes the introduction of a new stent, the MultiLink stent, into everyday clinical usage. As with all new devices and minor variations of contemporary devices, which slowly undergo small progressive changes, a careful assessment and audit must be undertaken to ensure it has resulted in improvement in, or at least no detriment to patient care. This chapter audits the clinical outcome of a new stent implanted in the first 126 patients in Auckland and Monash Medical Centre, Melbourne. Chapter 5 is a study that tests a refinement in interventional technique. With refinement and miniaturisation of angioplasty equipment including the profile of balloons and stents, the possibly of implanting a stent without predilating the lesions with a balloon was raised. In this study 81 patients with suitable coronary artery lesions were randomised to stenting with and without predilatation. It was found that in selected patients a strategy of direct stenting was feasible, faster and more rapid than stenting after predilatation. Chapter 6 describes a study which analyses data from 10 studies co-ordinated and managed by the Cardialysis core laboratory in Rotterdam The inclusion of risk factors allows the opportunity to perform meta-analyses looking for factors that may influence outcomes. In this case we attempted to identify clinical and angiographic factors that influence asymptomatic restenosis following percutaneous coronary intervention. Chapter 7 gives an overview of angioplasty numbers and practice in New Zealand by summarising data from the National Angioplasty Registry for the years 1995-1998. This period saw a steady growth in patients with coronary artery disease treated by percutaneous intervention and the number of patients who received stents rose from 23% in 1995 to 84% in 1998. This data attests to the data and results of the earlier studies reported in this thesis.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::320100 Medicine-General</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5533</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluation of a T-cell assay for mycobacterium tuberculosis infection in the Gambia</field><field name="creator">Hill, Philip Campbell</field><field name="description">New generation T cell assays offer hope in the diagnosis of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection and disease. We assessed the ELISPOT assay using cross-sectional and longitudinal studies and a natural gradient of M. tuberculosis exposure by sleeping proximity to a tuberculosis (TB) case in The Gambia. Two antigens, ESAT-6 and CFP-10 (EC), were compared to purified protein derivative (PPD) by ELISPOT and to the PPD skin test in 735 TB contacts. All three tests responded to the exposure gradient, the PPD skin test most dramatically. Inter-test comparison showed that the EC ELISPOT provided improved specificity in the diagnosis of M. tuberculosis infection, but at the cost of some sensitivity. Increasing discordance, particularly between PPD ELISPOT and PPD skin test results, down the exposure gradient to 105 community controls was identified. In 693 children, the EC ELISPOT was slightly less sensitive than the PPD skin test in the diagnosis of M. tuberculosis infection from recent exposure; neither test was confounded by prior BCG vaccination, even in the very young. A fusion protein of EC compared favourably with their respective peptides by ELISPOT assay in 488 TB contacts, a combined test result offered improved sensitivity. Quantitative ELISPOT and PPD-skin test responses were assessed in 1052 TB case contacts, according to an ELISPOT response to EC. Only the ELISPOT count was sensitive to the exposure gradient (p=0.009), revealing a positive dose-response relationship. In the longitudinal assessment, both ELISPOT and PPD skin test conversion occurred over time. PPD skin test reversion occurred in 10% of individuals after 18 months, ELISPOT reversion occurred in 39% at 3 months. In conclusion: the EC ELISPOT offers increased specificity in the diagnosis of M. tuberculosis infection in The Gambia, at the cost of some sensitivity; the PPD skin test appears to be down-regulated in the community; neither test is confounded by prior BCG vaccination; a fusion protein in combination with EC peptides offers optimal ELISPOT sensitivity; the quantitative ELISPOT response in specific-antigen-positive TB case contacts reflects the infectious load of M. tuberculosis; and significant early reversion of the ELISPOT test suggests it is unreliable in M. tuberculosis dormancy.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::320100 Medicine-General</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5539</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Lipiodol fertility enhancement in unexplained and endometriosis-related infertility</field><field name="creator">Johnson, Neil Philip</field><field name="description">Objectives This thesis had the following objectives: 1) To assess the existing evidence base for the effectiveness of tubal flushing as a treatment for infertility (Section II, Chapters 4 and 5). 2) To assess current practice and prior beliefs amongst Australasian fertility specialists concerning the role of tubal flushing as a treatment for infertility (Section III, Chapter 6). 3) To investigate the possible mechanism of the fertility enhancing effect of the oil soluble contrast medium lipiodol, and specifically whether there is an effect on the endometrium (Section IV, Chapter 7). 4) To generate definitive evidence from a randomised controlled trial for the effectiveness of lipiodol flushing as a treatment for infertility (Section V, Chapters 8 and 9). 5) To evaluate the adoption of lipiodol flushing as an innovative treatment into clinical practice (Section VI, Chapter 10). Methods The work undertaken in this thesis was based on prospective study protocols using the following research methodologies: Systematic reviews and meta-analyses of treatment efficacy to meet objective 1. Two types of structured survey questionnaires with a Bayesian analysis to meet objective 2. A randomised animal study involving 60 Swiss white mice, combined with genital flushing procedures under anaesthesia, some of which involved microsurgical techniques, followed by genital tissue harvesting, tissue preparation and immunohistochemistry studies to meet objective 3. An open, parallel group, single centre, randomised controlled trial involving 158 women with unexplained and endometriosis-related infertility to meet objective 4. A survival analysis of women in the lipiodol flushing randomised trial to meet objectives 4 and 5. A prospective observational study of the first 100 women to undergo lipiodol flushing in clinical practice to meet objective 5. A clinical hysterosalpingogram procedure to meet objective 4 and 5. Results 1) Eight randomised controlled trials involving 1,971 women were identified and included in the systematic review. Tubal flushing with oil soluble contrast media versus no intervention was associated with a significant increase in the odds of pregnancy (Peto odds ratio [OR] 3.57, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.76 to 7.23) but there were no data for live birth. There were no data from RCTs to assess tubal flushing with water-soluble media versus no intervention. Tubal flushing with oil soluble contrast media was associated with a significant increase in the odds of live birth versus tubal flushing with water soluble contrast media (OR 1.49, 95% CI 1.05 to 2.11) but the odds of pregnancy showed no significant difference (OR 1.24, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.57) and there was evidence of statistical heterogeneity for these two outcomes. The addition of oil soluble contrast media to flushing with water soluble contrast media (water plus oil soluble contrast media versus water soluble contrast media alone) showed no significant difference in the odds of live birth (OR 1.06, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.77) or pregnancy (OR 1.16, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.70). 2) Nineteen Australasian fertility specialists returned survey questionnaires. Eighteen of the 19 specialists believed that lipiodol flushing was more likely to be beneficial than harmful. The most widely held prior belief, reflected in both textual and numerical responses, was that lipiodol was likely to produce a small beneficial response. The credible limits of this belief were compatible with a reasonable fertility benefit, as more than 50% believed that a 1.5-fold increase in pregnancy rate was plausible. The two surveys found that a 1.2-fold or 1.4-fold increase in pregnancy rate was the median expected level of benefit at which clinicians would have been inclined to recommend lipiodol flushing to their patients (combined range 1.1 to 2.3-fold). Individual and collective equipoise was justification to proceed with a definitive randomised controlled trial. 3) The mean number of cluster determinant (CD) 205+ uterine dendritic cells decreased significantly in mice following lipiodol treatment compared to sham treated and saline treated mice, particularly in endometrial and subendometrial tissues. The mean number of CD1+ uterine dendritic cells increased significantly following lipiodol treatment compared to shamtreatment. No significant differences were found in the mean number of total leukocytes or macrophages in the murine uterus between the three treatment groups. 4) Six month follow up of the randomised trial of 158 women showed that lipiodol flushing resulted in a significant increase in pregnancy (48.0% versus 10.8%, RR 4.44, 95% CI 1.61-12.21) and live birth (40.0% versus 10.8%, RR 3.70,.95% CI 1.30-10.50) rates versus no intervention for women with endometriosis (n=62), although there was no significant difference in pregnancy (33.3% versus 20.8%, RR 1.60, 95% CI 0.81-3.16) or live birth (27.1% versus 14.6%, RR 1.86, 95% CI 0.81-4.25) rates for women with unexplained infertility without confirmed endometriosis (n=96). Survival analysis up to 24 months showed a significant benefit in overall pregnancy rate following lipiodol treatment (hazard ratio 2.0, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.3 to 3.2) for the combined endometriosis and unexplained infertility populations. Amongst women with endometriosis, the benefit in pregnancy rate seen in the first 6 months following lipiodol (hazard ratio 5.4, 95% CI 2.1 to 14.2) was not present at 6 to 24 months following lipiodol (hazard ratio 0.6, 95% CI 0.2 to 2.1). There was a more consistent effect of lipiodol on fertility throughout the 24 month follow up amongst women with unexplained infertility (hazard ratio 2.0, 95% CI 1.1 to 3.5). 5) Six month follow up in the observational study of 100 women undergoing lipiodol flushing as an innovative treatment in clinical practice showed an overall pregnancy rate 30% and live birth or ongoing pregnancy rate 27% six months after the procedure. For women under 40 years old, a 32% pregnancy rate and 25% live birth or ongoing pregnancy rate was seen in women with unexplained infertility; a 50% pregnancy rate and 47% live birth or ongoing pregnancy rate was seen in women with endometriosis. Of women aged 40 years and older, the pregnancy rate was 13% and the live birth or ongoing pregnancy rate was 13%. The pregnancy rates included those occurring after additional interventions, such as intrauterine insemination and in-vitro fertilisation, accounting for 12 of the 30 pregnancies. There were no treatment complications. Conclusions The conclusions of this thesis are as follows. Lipiodol flushing is a simple, inexpensive, effective fertility treatment, which carries a very low chance of complications and no increased chance of multiple pregnancy. Lipiodol treatment is particularly effective in the short term for women with endometriosis who have normal patent fallopian tubes. The fertility benefit from lipiodol treatment lasts longer for women with pure unexplained infertility than for women with endometriosis. The level of benefit from lipiodol treatment for women with unexplained and endometriosis-related infertility is of sufficient magnitude to convince most fertility specialists surveyed that it is a worthwhile treatment to offer routinely in clinical practice; however complex factors govern the implementation of an innovative fertility treatment. Observational study of the first 100 women to undergo lipiodol treatment in clinical practice has provided further evidence of the efficacy and safety of this approach. Uterine dendritic cell changes following lipiodol flushing in mice suggest that the mechanism of the fertility enhancing effect might be an immunobiologic effect on the endometrium that could improve the receptivity of the endometrium (rather than a mechanical tubal flushing effect), although this hypothesis requires further exploration in women.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::320100 Medicine-General</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5544</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Selective cerebral hypothermia for term infants following hypoxic ischaemic injury</field><field name="creator">Battin, Malcolm Richard</field><field name="description">Perinatal hypoxic ischaemic injury is an important cause of both neonatal death and long-term disability. The sequence of resuscitation followed by a latent phase then a secondary cascade of injury is well documented. This thesis covers key steps toward the utilization of selective hypothermia as an intervention during the latent phase to ameliorate the secondary injury and improve subsequent outcome. The technique was shown to be both feasible and well tolerated. Specifically, a rectal temperature of 35 &#176;C and 34.5 &#176;C, in term infants with neonatal encephalopathy, was not associated with an excessive requirement for cardio-respiratory support. Although a decrease in heart rate occurred during cooling, this was expected and there was no significant change in blood pressure during either the cooling or rewarming phase. Additional reassuring findings were that neither major electrolyte disturbance; hypoglycaemia or haematological changes, including excessive haemorrhage, were observed during hypothermia. The study of neurodevelopmental outcome established that selective cerebral hypothermia was not associated with late adverse effects and, in infants with moderate to severe encephalopathy, the combined cooled groups demonstrated a trend towards better outcome. These data confirmed the potential for selective cerebral hypothermia to provide neuroprotection following perinatal asphyxia. In further chapters cerebral CT scan was confirmed as a helpful adjunct to clinical staging in predicting neurodevelopmental outcome and important clinical experience was reported including rebound seizures following rewarming; sclerema neonatorum associated with hypothermia; and abnormal flow in the superior sagittal sinus, associated with perinatal asphyxia. Lastly a review of infants assessed but not recruited to the CoolCap trial based on aEEG criteria was performed. As these aEEG criteria could be applied to future clinical use it was considered important to ensure large numbers of infants with potential to benefit were not excluded from intervention Neurodevelopmental status for those infants excluded by the aEEG criteria was largely favourable but a small number had adverse outcome and the majority manifested short term morbidity. In conclusion, the work presented in this thesis suggests that intervention with selective hypothermia offers the potential to change disease progression and improve subsequent outcome following perinatal asphyxia at term.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::320100 Medicine-General</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5545</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Uterine effects of inhibition of progesterone synthesis by a specific 3 B hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase inhibitor</field><field name="creator">Pattison, Neil Spencer</field><field name="description">The steroid hormone progesterone is considered indisPensible for pregnancy - it is the 'hormone of pregnancy' as described by corner (1928). It is generally agreed that the role of progesterone in all species is to Prepare the endometrium for pregnancy and to contribute to the maintenance of myometrial quiescence from implantation to the end of Pregnancy. There is however, a conflict of opinion concerning its role in pregnancy termination. In some species, for example the sheep, there is considerable evidence that progesterone provides an important link between fetal cortisol and the control of uterine activity. But in human pregnancy the evidence is conflicting. The present study investigates the role of progesterone in the initiation of uterine activity in; - late pregnant ehtes, - early human pregnancy and - the luteal phase of the human menstrual cycIe. The study was designed following the development of a 3 B-nyaroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3 B-ttso) inhibitor (Epostane) by Sterling Winthrop Research.

The source and management of donor tissue procured by the New Zealand National Eye Bank (NZNEB) was analysed. Significant trends were identified with respect to donor demographics, donor procurement source, improved donor tissue processing and storage, decreased biological contamination, and increased utilization of corneal tissue. Current trends and ethnicity differences in indications for penetrating keratoplasty (PKP) were investigated. Keratoconus was identified as the most common indication for PKP in New Zealand, accounting for a significantly higher proportion of PKPs than other published reports. Keratoconus was the most common indication for PKP throughout all ethnicity groups and was particularly common in the Maori and Polynesian populations. Significant trends were identified including an increase in the number of PKPs for regraft and Fuchs&#8217; endothelial dystrophy and a decrease for aphakic or pseudophakic bullous keratopathy and viral keratitis. Survival and visual outcome following PKP in New Zealand was investigated using univariate and multivariate analysis. Several independent risk factors were identified that influenced outcome of PKP. Active inflammation at PKP, pre-existing vascularisation, pre-operative glaucoma, small or large graft size, intra-operative complications, episodes of reversible rejection and a pre-operative diagnosis of regraft, trauma or infection resulted in a significantly decreased survival rate. Advancing recipient age, active inflammation at the time of PKP, pre-existing vascularisation, pre-operative glaucoma, episodes of reversible rejection, bullous keratopathy, trauma and non-infective keratitis were associated with poor visual outcome. Patient characteristics, indications, surgical details, and outcome of paediatric keratoplasty were analysed. Acquired non-traumatic indications accounted for the majority of paediatric keratoplasties in New Zealand. This study highlighted keratoconus as a particularly common indication for paediatric keratoplasty when compared to other countries. Survival and visual outcome was better for acquired compared to congenital indications. The effects of corneal parameters on the measurement of endothelial cell density (ECD) in the normal eye were analysed. Corneal thickness appears to be negatively correlated to ECD in the normal cornea for all age groups. Corneal diameter is correlated to ECD measurement in children but not in adults. Corneal curvature was not significantly correlated to ECD measurement, but this needs further investigation. Confocal microscopy and slit scanning topography were used to analyze endothelial morphology and function in the short and long term following PKP. The results of this study are in concordance with other published reports that have identified an accelerated loss of endothelial cells and more rapid development of abnormal endothelial cells in transplanted corneas compared to normal corneas.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::320100 Medicine-General</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5553</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Rhegmatogenous retinal detachment : a New Zealand perspective</field><field name="creator">Polkinghorne, Philip John</field><field name="description">In New Zealand, rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD) is recognised as a serious and potentially blinding disorder but little is known about the prevalence, risk factors, management and outcomes for treatment for our population. This thesis attempts to investigate these issues and part of that documentation involved a clinical review of those individuals presenting with RRD. That survey was performed over a 16 month interval enabling the annualised rate for individuals presenting with a new RRD to be determined. The prevalence was found to be 11.8 per 100,000. The risk was age-related with the incidence of RRD increasing for each decade up until the age of 70 years. Men had a slightly greater risk of RRD, and high myopes (greater than 6 dioptres) accounted for approximately 1/3 of the presentations. A history of cataract surgery was also noted to be a significant risk factor for RRD. A subsequent investigation documented in this thesis determined the rate of RRD following cataract surgery using phaco-emulsification techniques was 1%. The risk for pseudo-phakic patients was inversely related to age. The initial survey revealed approximately 2/3 of the patients presented with macula-off RRDs. While individually many of these patients did well, as a group the functional improvement following surgery was limited and less than 1/3 of eyes achieved LogMAR 0.3. It was not always apparent what factors negatively impacted on the functional prognosis but certainly those individuals requiring more than one surgery tended to fare worse. The impact of a poor visual outcome was not directly assessed in this thesis but it is likely those individuals do suffer in terms of visual functioning and quality of life issues. In New Zealand there are a number of agencies that care and support visually impaired persons but there is inadequate data to assess and benchmark treatment and rehabilitation. If this could be achieved for patients with RRD then those barriers which potentially restrict successful outcomes might provide useful insight for other individuals with visual impairment.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::320100 Medicine-General</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5554</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies of the regulation of the somatotrophic axis : with particular reference to the growth hormone receptor</field><field name="creator">Ambler, Geoffrey Richard</field><field name="description">The somatotrophic axis plays a vital role in the hormonal regulation of growth and intermediary metabolism. It encompasses the regulation of pituitary growth hormone (GH) secretion from the pituitary gland, the actions of GH on peripheral tissues via interactions with specific growth hormone receptors (GHR) and subsequent endocrine, paracrine and autocrine events, many of which are mediated via the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) system and its regulators. There are multiple effectors and points of regulation within the axis, including feedback loops, functioning to maintain homeostasis of the organism in physiological and pathophysiological situations. This thesis focuses on a number of studies of GH action and the GH receptor and its regulation, and subsequent processes mediated via the IGF system. Specific aims include further understanding the role of GH and the GHR in fetal and early life, exploring the interaction of other hormones (particularly placental lactogen and somatostatin) with the somatotrophic axis and examining the somatotrophic axis in a rapidly growing tissue (the antler) which does not appear to express the GHR. The ontogenic and GH regulation of the hepatic GHR (as reflected by hepatic bovine GH (bGH) specific binding) and serum GH binding protein (GHBP) were studied in the pig. Marked age-related increases were seen in serum GHBP and hepatic bGH binding, and both were increased by recombinant porcine GH treatment in infant and pubertal animals. Serum IGF-I correlated significantly with serum GHBP and hepatic bGH specific binding. Serum GHBP levels reflected major changes in the hepatic GHR, but not closely in pubertal animals, suggesting some differential regulation. Also, the low levels of hepatic GHR in the infant pig were inducible by GH, suggesting GH responsiveness and a role for GH in early life. In further exploring the role of GH in early life, GH (but not IGF-I) administration to neonatal dwarf rats was found to have small but significant somatogenic effects on growth, serum IGF-I and body composition, with an associated decrease in hepatic bGH specific binding. These studies support a role for GH and GH responsiveness in the neonatal rat. This concept was able to be explored indirectly in the human by studying birth weight and early growth in GH-deficient infants. These infants were short at birth with relative adiposity, and had impaired longitudinal growth in the first year of life, suggesting some GH-dependence of growth in fetal life and early infancy. In investigating the perinatal changes in the GHR and serum IGF-I levels, post-mature fetuses were found to have much lower hepatic bGH specific binding than neonatal lambs of the same post-conceptional age, suggesting that these increases relate to events at parturition, and not to post-conceptional age or intrinsic timing. Thus, while evidence is emerging for a significant role of GH and the GHR in fetal life, major induction of these somatotrophic axis components appears to be inhibited until after birth. Since placental lactogen (PL) has been suggested as having an important role in fetal growth and metabolism, the binding properties and somatogenic properties of ovine PL (oPL) were explored. Studies in dwarf rats demonstrated somatogenic effects of oPL which were in some instances greater than those of bGH. Receptor binding studies in rat and sheep livers consistently showed greater potency of oPL, although with detailed displacement studies in sheep showing parallel changes in oPL and bGH binding over a range of developmental stages. This and other supporting evidence suggest that oPL may interact with the GHR or a closely related receptor, although the possibility of a distinct oPL receptor cannot be conclusively discounted. While the GHR is clearly of major importance in the regulation of growth in many tissues, no GHRs were demonstrated in deer antler by autoradiography or radioreceptor assays. Specific binding sites were identified for IGF-I and IGF-II, with properties suggestive of the type 1 and type 2 IGF receptors. Thus, endocrine IGF-I is proposed to have a prominent role in antler growth, although local IGF production and action is also likely to be important. Finally, in exploring other potential regulators of the GHR, the possibility of direct effects of somatostatin on the GHR was examined, since somatostatin has been suggested to influence the peripheral somatotrophic axis by reducing GH-induced IGF-I expression. Octreotide administration was associated with decreased IGF-I expression, yet with increases in hepatic GHR expression, suggesting that the suppressive effects of octreotide on IGF-I metabolism are not mediated via downregulation of GHR expression, but more likely by direct effects on IGF-I expression. The studies in this thesis have furthered the understanding of some aspects of the role and regulation of GH and the GHR in the somatotrophic axis. Many questions remain to be answered on the complicated role played by these systems in the regulation of growth and metabolism.</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::320100 Medicine-General</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5555</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fetal origins hypothesis in twin children : a metabolic evaluation</field><field name="creator">Jefferies, Craig Alan</field><field name="description">This thesis explores whether low birth weight affects glucose homeostasis and other aspects of the metabolic syndrome in twin children. The key parameter studied is insulin resistance, and whether insulin resistance is also associated with abnormalities in blood pressure or other aspects of the metabolic syndrome. This thesis is a comparison of twins to singletons, rather than being a study of these traits within twin pairs. The fetal origins hypothesis suggests that low birth weight ultimately is associated with adult onset diseases namely coronary heart disease, glucose intolerance and hypertension. All twins to a degree are born prematurely and with low birth weight. It is unclear whether their metabolism in later life reflects this, or alternatively reflects their uniqueness as twins irrespective of birth weight. This thesis reviews how adaptation for their unique fetal life has affected in particular, glucose homeostasis in twins. Insulin resistance has been consistently identified prior to the onset of both type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension and is also the primary metabolic abnormality persisting from programming of the undernourished fetus. Both small-for-gestational-age and prematurely born infants are insulin resistant when examined in mid-childhood. It has been postulated that this represents an attempt of the fetus to salvage itself from a state of inadequate nutrition. Twins when examined in this thesis are also shown to be insulin resistant, or to have a reduction in insulin sensitivity. This insulin resistance was independent of low birth weight and prematurity, and reflected a unique twin effect. Examing blood pressure precisely revealed that twins had increased night-time blood pressure, a feature also seen in a variety of pre-hypertensive states. However, there was no association between low birth weight and any 24 hour blood pressure monitoring parameter in twins. Twins also had elevated leptin levels but reduced TNF-alpha levels in twins irrespective of birth weight or prematurity. Twins have unique metabolic profiles which are not correlated with low birth weight, and twins should be considered an exception to the fetal origins hypothesis.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::320100 Medicine-General</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5557</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Structure-function relationships in plant terpene synthases</field><field name="creator">Green, Sol Alexander</field><field name="description">Terpene synthases (TPS) are a family of enzymes responsible for synthesising the vast array of terpenoid compounds known to exist in nature. In plants these compounds serve to increase ecological fitness, while commercially they represent one of the key compound classes in determining the quality of food products, including flavour and aroma in fruit crops. Preliminary functional characterisation of an apple (Malus x domestica) TPS responsible for the production of &#945;-farnesene (MdAFS1), which constitutes the major terpene volatile in apple, showed novel features not previously reported for a TPS enzyme. These included the apparent ability of MdAFS1 to generate &#945;-farnesene by a prenyltransferase reaction and being the first angiosperm TPS with a dependence on potassium for activity. The focus of this PhD study was to extend the preliminary functional analysis of MdAFS1 and provide definitive proof for this prenyltransferase activity and also the location and nature of the MdAFS1 potassium binding region. In the research presented here, mutagenesis of the MdAFS1 aspartate-rich divalent metal ion binding motif removed TPS and prenyltransferase activities, showing not only that MdAFS1 possessed intrinsic prenyltransferase function but that both TPS and prenyltransferase catalysis were occurring through the same active site. Protein modelling also revealed a surface-exposed loop (H-&#945;l loop) in MdAFS1 that fulfilled the necessary requirements for a potassium binding region. Site-directed mutagenesis analysis of specific residues within this loop then revealed their crucial importance to this potassium response and strongly implicated specific residues in direct potassium binding. The role of the H-&#945;l loop in terpene synthase potassium coordination was confirmed in a conifer pinene synthase also using site-directed mutagenesis. These findings provide the first direct evidence for a specific potassium binding region in two functionally and phylogenetically divergent terpene synthases. They also provide a basis for understanding potassium activation in other TPS enzymes and establish a new role for the H-&#945;l loop region in TPS catalysis. Structural insights were also sought for how MdAFS1 might have evolved from an ancestral mono-TPS enzyme. A combination of contact mapping and mutagenesis analysis identified a single non-synonymous nucleotide substitution that could explain one route for the requisite shift in substrate specificity necessary for &#945;-farnesene synthesis. Abstract II Taken together, the work presented in this thesis provides the foundation for future investigation into the catalytic mechanisms and evolution of plant terpene synthases. Broadening the scope of this and related studies so as to begin unravelling the complex interplay between plant ecological fitness and TPS catalytic specificity still remains an enormous future challenge.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5560</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Compression deformation of glass fibre reinforcements in composites manufacturing processes</field><field name="creator">Somashekar, Arcot Arumugam</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted until 06/2011, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5579</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Understanding the notion of interdependence, and the dynamics of willingness to communicate</field><field name="creator">Cao, Yiqian</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted until 12/2010, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5584</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cardiovascular disease risk factors and diabetes in Pacific adults: The Diabetes Heart and Health Study (DHAH), Auckland, New Zealand 2002/03</field><field name="creator">Sundborn, Gerhard Benjamin McDonald</field><field name="description">This thesis aims were to describe health related socio-economic profiles, alcohol consumption patterns, the prevalence of diabetes mellitus (known and undiagnosed) and to quantify levels of overweight and obesity and other cardiovascular disease risk factors among adults of Pacific ethnic groups and to compare these findings to Europeans in Auckland, New Zealand.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5589</field></doc><doc><field name="title">New Zealand&#8217;s Pop Renaissance: A creative industry as &#8216;after neo-liberal&#8217; social policy</field><field name="creator">Scott, Michael William</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted until March 2011, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5595</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Madness in context in the Histories of Herodotus</field><field name="creator">Dawson, Abigail Rebecca</field><field name="description">This thesis is a study of the way Herodotus uses madness in his Histories. It aims to examine the changing nature of madness depending on the context in which Herodotus uses it. I also examine some examples of madness in the works of Homer, the Tragedians and the Hippocratic corpus in order to illuminate the varying examples from the Histories. This required close reading of all works in question in the original Ancient Greek as well as examination of secondary literature on the authors and topics concerned. Herodotus&#8217; use of madness varies according to the context in which he uses it, so he does not have a coherent view of madness. Madness, as Herodotus employs the concept, is often violent, but not always physically; it may be verbal or may be used of a person who expresses a violent idea. Sometimes it is a divine punishment; sometimes it signals transgression against divine law. He also uses madness as a literary device to highlight themes of the various logoi, and to reflect not only the state of the one called mad, but the one who is using the term. His usage is similar in some ways to each of the works of Homer, the Tragedians and the Hippocratic writers. In conclusion, madness is a device which Herodotus uses to good effect depending on what effect he wishes to make at the time, in a specific logos.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5596</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Three-wait-citizen: narratives of lived experiences of older persons with depression in Macau</field><field name="creator">Zeng, Wen</field><field name="description">Three meta-categories are drawn from the dominant categories and themes reflected across the findings; physical/material meta-category, social/family meta-category, and mental suffering meta-category.

This gives rise to multi-objective optimisation. We discuss a range of different bi-objective routing or transportation problems, in particular the shortest path, integer minimum cost flow, and traffic assignment problems. The first part of this thesis is dedicated to the bi-objective shortest path problem. The problem is presented together with several well-known solution algorithms, namely bi-objective labelling, ranking, and the Two Phase method. Computational experiments highlight the strengths and weaknesses of the algorithms for different types of problem instances. We introduce new variations of the algorithms above and propose an easily implemented improvement for bi-objective labelling. Cyclist route choice in road networks is presented as a new application of the bi-objective shortest path problem, where cyclists aim to reach their destination in minimal travel time, but also along a safe route. For the bi-objective integer minimum cost flow problem, we introduce one of the first solution algorithms based on the Two Phase method and demonstrate its performance based on different types of problem instances. An improvement of the algorithm for the transportation problem, a special case, is also discussed. Finally, multi-objective traffic assignment is discussed. Traffic assignment is the process of modelling route choice of users of a (road) network in order to determine the total traffic on each road of the network. This is an equilibrium problem as the route choice of one traveller affects other travellers. We show how, traditionally, multiple objectives are treated in traffic assignment, often by combining them into a generalised cost function which may entail strong assumptions on road user behaviour. Instead, we suggest to explicitly distinguish the objectives in a multi-objective framework. We discuss existing literature, which is of mainly theoretical nature, and comment on several articles presenting erroneous results. We contribute to the understanding of the theoretical concepts of vector equilibrium, vector variational inequalities, and vector optimisation. For the solution of bi-objective traffic assignment, we propose novel heuristic algorithms based on bi-objective shortest path algorithms as an important building block.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5612</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dual-focus inhibition of myopia evaluation in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Anstice, Nicola</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted until 01/2011, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5613</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A consideration of homeostatic regulation of eating from the perspective of Maharishi Vedic Science</field><field name="creator">Lovell-Smith, Hugh David</field><field name="description">How humans regulate eating and why regulation fails in many people is not well understood. Obesity has reached unprecedented proportions. Diabetes and heart disease are among a range of illnesses associated with excessive caloric intake and poor energy balance. A theory of food regulation is proposed within a paradigm sufficiently broad to encompass and integrate mind and body. The theory states that homeostatic eating occurs when the pleasure of eating fulfils the desire to eat. It is suggested that absent, unrecognised or misinterpreted eating sensations represent missing key afferent information in homeostatic eating such that eating is not fully pleasurable for some people. Externally oriented attention and recoded perception may account for the non-recognition of key eating sensations. The theory offers an explanation as to why so-called normal eaters may suffer from disorders ranging from coronary artery disease to autoimmune diseases. The theory predicts that relatively simple means could alleviate many such diseases and suggests how to test this prediction. If upheld, the theory could assist people to maintain their own well being and could help to prevent and treat some of the major scourges of Western society.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5614</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Organosolv delignification of willow: Kinetics, recovery and use</field><field name="creator">MacFarlane, Alan L.</field><field name="description">Pretreatment is critical to the conversion of biomass into valuable chemicals. Willow (Salix spp), consisting mainly of polysaccharides and lignin, was used in this study of lignin in three stages. The delignification reaction using the organosolv process, the recovery of lignin from organosolv spent liquor by precipitation and dissolved air flotation, and the use of lignin for polymer production were studied. A novel method of determining delignification activation energy using fewer pulping experiments was developed. Several reaction rate constants were determined during a single pulping run by examining kinetics at different reaction times with a slowly increasing temperature. The effects of changing ethanol concentration were then investigated using this method. Only the change in pH caused by changing ethanol concentration had a significant effect on delignification rate. Prehydrolysis has been used to selectively remove hemicellulose prior to organosolv pulping. De-ashing is a treatment to remove the acid-neutralising components (ash and extractives) of biomass. It was previously thought that organosolv delignification proceeded faster after prehydrolysis due to increased accessibility of solvent to lignin. However, prehydrolysis did not result in faster subsequent delignification compared to de-ashing. De-ashing and prehydrolysis treatments removed the acid neutralising components of wood while prehydrolysis also removed a portion of the polysaccharides. It may be the lower pH resulting from prehydrolysis that increases subsequent organosolv delignification rate compared to untreated feedstock. Upon dilution of organosolv black liquor, lignin forms a precipitate, which is typically removed by filtration or centrifugation. The use of dissolved air flotation (DAF) presents a low cost alternative that utilizes the hydrophobicity of organosolv lignin. The parameters important to the dissolved air flotation of organosolv lignin were studied using fractional factorial design. Fastest flotation occurs when saturation pressure is high and black liquor-water mixing is rapid resulting in the redistribution of micro-bubbles Abstract iii during floc formation. Precipitation must occur below 35&#176;C to cause sufficient flocculation. Phenol formaldehyde resins were prepared with 20% w/w of the phenol replaced by lignin (lignin-PF resin). Lignin-PF resins prepared from the most depolymerised lignin had comparable strength to pure PF resin when strength was compared using a lap joint test.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5615</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies on the internal failure mechanics of lumbar intervertebral discs</field><field name="creator">Veres, Samuel Peter</field><field name="description">While several mechanical disruption studies of lumbar intervertebral discs have previously been carried out in vitro, none have sought to examine the microstructure of the resulting tissue failures.

Postcolonial fiction in New Zealand and Australia draws on pre-colonial, colonial, and postcolonial narratives of landscape to create compelling representations of place and people. In the adult fiction of New Zealand author Maurice Gee and Australian author David Malouf, characters typically turn to the landscape at moments of crisis or transition. Close analysis of Gee&#8217;s and Malouf&#8217;s fiction demonstrates that the physical environment serves as a touchstone for personal and national identity throughout personal and national histories. From childhood to old age, characters seek self-definition by locating themselves within their physical environment, rather than by directly referencing their social or cultural context. Individual life stages are shown to be analogous to early stages of national development for New Zealand and Australia &#8211; the journey from colonial child to mature identity for both the individual and the nation is figured through landscape images. However, Gee and Malouf also use the relationship between characters and landscape to reflect social attitudes and values, demonstrating a connection between confident identification with the &#8216;other&#8217; of the landscape and the ability to integrate meaningfully with the &#8216;others&#8217; of human society. Thus landscape functions in these texts as a means of both reflecting and constructing identity in postcolonial New Zealand and Australia.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5617</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Constitutional conflicts and aboriginal rights: hunting, fishing and gathering rights in Canada, New Zealand and the United States</field><field name="creator">Charlton, Guy</field><field name="description">Judicial resolution of non-aboriginal conflicts was crucial to the vindication of indigenous rights within the new state as the determination of the nature and quality of aboriginal legal interests and entitlements involved fundamental questions of land ownership, secure legal title for settler alienation, as well as governmental priority and competence. If not for these disputes, court decisions and common law doctrine solicitous of indigenous interests based on the idea of indigenous occupancy, use and possession of their territory, and the creation of law based on colonial and imperial policy -- which incorporated notions of indigenous sovereignty and supported pluralist legal relations -- would have been discarded by the courts due to the underlying dynamism and logic of colonialism. Using a recent judicial decision by the highest court in each jurisdiction as a window to discuss the various approaches courts have taken to usufructuary rights, this thesis discusses the major components of the legal doctrine of hunting, fishing and gathering rights in Canada, New Zealand and the United States. It argues that the judicial protection of these aboriginal or treaty rights have been profoundly affected by non-aboriginal disputes over the constitution and the nature of national polity. At the same time the analysis suggests that values &#8213;external to the law are not the sole determinant of judicial outcomes over time. Rather in certain instances the legal doctrine and decisions implicate values inherent to the legal system, such as a conceptual commitment to a logical internal structure, a respect for precedent and previous governmental policy as well as the principle that courts are disinterested dispensers of neutral justice. These internal values comingle with deep-seated commitments held by individual decision-makers and the judiciary more generally, regarding the constitutional structure of the state and the role of the judiciary.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5624</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Second chances: youth justice co-ordinators&#8217; perspectives on the youth justice family group conference process.</field><field name="creator">Slater, Christine Marie</field><field name="description">In New Zealand&#8217;s system of Youth Justice (YJ) the Family Group Conference (FGC) process plays a pivotal role in addressing the offending behaviour of young people under seventeen. Mandated under the Children, Young Persons, and their Families Act 1989 (the Act), the FGC is a formal meeting in which the persons most affected by a young person&#8217;s offending, typically the young person, their family, their victim(s) and associated professionals, collectively decide how the young person should be held accountable. The process is managed by a YJ Co-ordinator, appointed by the Department of Child, Youth and Family (the Department). This dissertation presents the findings of an evaluation of the YJ FGC process from the perspectives of YJ Co-ordinators. The study aimed to understand the process and the development of practice, to identify factors constituting best practice and current areas of weakness in the process. It comprised of semi-structured interviews with (n=19) YJ Co-ordinators with at least twelve years&#8217; practitioner experience (Project One) and four focus groups (n=27) of Co-ordinators with a range of practice (Project Two). Three major themes emerged from the thematic analysis of data: a) The Act as Anchor &#8211; philosophical underpinnings of the FGC process, b) Working with the Act &#8211; best practice and current issues in YJ FGC service provision, and c) The Office &#8211; organisational factors. The results indicated the YJ FGC process was effective for the majority of young people, but generally inadequate for recidivist young offenders with complex additional needs. Aspects of best practice included: aligned professional approaches to FGC philosophy and practice, service delivery by trained YJ Co-ordinators and the quality of FGC preparation. Also considered best practice was the inclusion of victims in the process to assist in the development of a strengths-based personalised plan for the young person. With several areas of weakness identified, recommendations for improving the process included: addressing Co-ordinator training and Departmental leadership, reviewing the process for recidivists, improving process information quality, enhancing professional collaboration and addressing Police training in the Act and the FGC. Limitations of the study and directions for future research are discussed.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5626</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Spiritual intelligence and imagination in New Zealand students</field><field name="creator">Kannan, Kevin Vijay Christopher</field><field name="description">Teachers in New Zealand schools are called on by documents such as The Zealand  Curriculum Framework (2007) and Gifted and Talented Education in New Zealand Schools (2004) to address the moral and spiritual development of both gifted and mainstream students. This study explores a key issue: the role and importance of imagination in the developmental stages of spiritual intelligence in students within each of these groups. By comparing students in a Catholic integrated school with those in a State intermediate school, it identifies both similarities and differences that teachers need to take into account in carrying out their professional responsibilities. The study begins by analysing and explaining concepts of spiritual intelligence that are often a source of ambiguity and confusion for teachers. It draws on a well-established hierarchal stage developmental theory of spiritual intelligence, but supplements this with a corresponding account of the role of imagination in the formation of spiritual intelligence at each of these stages. Spiritual intelligence is based on a theistic definition and its development on the imagination side of cognition rather than emotions. This results in the development of a nine stage taxonomy which is tested by analysis of variance (ANOVA). The research design examines seven important social factors, or variables, affecting the development of spiritual intelligence: school age group (intermediate, middle and senior), gender (male and female), school sample type (gifted and talented and average mainstream), areas of giftedness and talent (bodily-kinaesthetic, logical-mathematical, linguistic, musical, spatial, interpersonal and environmental), type of school (state and integrated), ethnicity (New Zealand European and others) and religion (Catholic, non-Catholic Christians, other religions and no religion). Using Fisher's Exact Test of variance, current trends in the spiritual intelligence characteristics of students are identified. The study provides teachers with four statistically verified tasks, their respective criterion referenced task assessment schedules (CRS) and exemplars for assessing stages of development of spiritual intelligence in students. The findings of this research project will help teachers of Values Education and Religious Education, Directors of Religious Studies (DRS) and Boards of Trustees in Catholic integrated schools to understand the theoretical and pedagogical principles of spiritual development, enabling them to design research-based programmes for advancing spiritual intelligence in their students.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5629</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Monitoring and simulation of the filling and post-filling stages of the resin infusion process</field><field name="creator">Govignon, Quentin Paul Nic&#233;phore Marc Marie</field><field name="description">The doctoral research presented in this thesis is focused on the resin infusion moulding process. The resin infusion process is part of the liquid composite moulding family where a dry reinforcement is impregnated with a liquid resin inside a closed mould to form a composite part. The specificity of resin infusion resides in the fact that only one side of the mould is rigid, the cavity being sealed by a vacuum bag. The preform compaction and fluid flow are driven by the pressure difference between the cavity and the ambient pressure. The reinforcement can therefore exhibit through thickness deformation as the resin penetrates the cavity. The aim of the research was to monitor and simulate the process. A number of previous studies have considered the impregnation process, but very little work had focused on the post-filling stage of the process, once the resin inlet is closed and the resin pressure field inside the mould is left to equilibrate.  In the first part of this study, the behaviour of two different fibrous reinforcements was experimentally characterised, and a new model was developed to replicate the compaction behaviour of the reinforcements. This model is based on elastic behaviour, but was able to account for the compaction history of the reinforcement.  A comprehensive monitoring system was designed and built to collect relevant experimental data to be compared with the simulation. This included i  the development of a mould fitted with sensors, as well as a stereophotogrammetry system which provides full field monitoring of variations in reinforcement properties. This system measures local cavity thickness, allowing calculation of other parameters such as fibre volume fraction and permeability.  A 1D finite element simulation of the resin infusion process is subsequently presented. The simulation covers both the filling and post-filling stages of the process and uses a modified version of Darcy&#8217;s law to govern the flow of fluid through porous media.  Finally, an investigation of different factors affecting the post-filing is presented through both simulation and experimental evaluations.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5630</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The pedagogy of the clinic: health professionals and women with viral sexually transmitted infections</field><field name="creator">Cook, Catherine</field><field name="description">This study investigates sexual health teaching and its effects. The focus is on how the health clinic works as a pedagogical environment where lessons are offered by clinicians to women patients (often unwittingly) about morality, femininity and the body. Of central concern is the question of how health professionals might contribute to women's quality of life after a viral STI diagnosis. I use examples of the reported engagement between clinicians, women and the two most common viral STIs, the human papilloma virus (HPV) and the herpes simplex virus (HSV). To consider the effects of the myriad beliefs that inform clinical teaching I draw from poststructuralist feminist discourse theory. For data collection I used in-depth email interviews, a research method that allowed participants with viral STIs to 'speak' more freely than might be possible in face-to-face interviews. The method also readily enabled me to interview sexual health clinicians and other women within a wide geographical area, in New Zealand, Australia, North America and England. My research findings include the insights that: by the time women seek out medical care for a viral STI they have received considerable social 'education' that STIs are categorically different from other conditions; although clinicians emphasise the normalcy of viral STIs they tend to have limited knowledge of the difficulties women face in disruptions to sexuality after a diagnosis. Liberal views about sex do not necessarily make the negotiation of safer heterosexual sex and prevention of STI transmission easier for women. Women found it helpful when clinicians addressed both the medical 'normalcy' of viral STIs and their potential to disrupt women's sense of self, sexual and social relationships. In public health education, gynaecological examinations are presented as a routine and essential practice, yet my study found that such examinations are often difficult for women. Research addressing women's reasons for non-compliance with screening emphasises 'underlying' psychological categories of 'anxiety' and 'poor coping'. Minimal attention is paid to the effects of clinicians' interventions upon women's decision-making. My findings indicate that women's screening compliance is influenced by clinicians' gender, (in) attention to power relations, rapport-building, attentiveness to bodily (dis)comfort, and technical skill. In striving for non-judgmental, scientific teaching, clinicians were often unaware that their talk inevitably constituted viral STIs as 'moral' infections. Clinicians may best contribute to women's lives by acknowledging that medical discourse is only one part of the fragmentary and contradictory education women receive about bodies and selves.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5632</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Unravelling the interactions of the beta7 integrin cytoplasmic domain</field><field name="creator">Chan, Yih-Chih</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted until 03/2012, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5638</field></doc><doc><field name="title">M&#257;tauranga T&#363;hoe: the centrality of M&#257;tauranga-a-iwi to M&#257;ori education.</field><field name="creator">Doherty, William</field><field name="description">The general aim of this thesis is to improve understanding about the place of m&#257;tauranga-a-iwi in the education system. In the modern education system, the linked terms m&#257;tauranga-a-iwi, m&#257;tauranga M&#257;ori, and kaupapa M&#257;ori theory are used to define M&#257;ori identity and M&#257;ori knowledge. But this thesis argues that these concepts must be grounded in a 'real', environmentally-located knowledge within tribal lands. It follows that m&#257;tauranga M&#257;ori, and kaupapa M&#257;ori theory, with their roots in m&#257;tauranga-a-iwi, must ultimately be understood as a relationship between the tribal environment and its people. The tribal environment, or rohe, of T&#363;hoe is the illustrative site of m&#257;tauranga-a-iwi for this thesis. The rohe for T&#363;hoe is Te Urewera. The relationship that exists between T&#363;hoe and this landscape is outlined mapping this intimate relationship (chapter 2). The thesis does the work of explaining what m&#257;tauranga-a-T&#363;hoe is, and how it has developed through a series of historical engagements. These things were learned by me at the feet of my grandmother (chapter 1). The engagements include: iwi interactions (chapter 6), Pakeha and Crown engagements (chapter 7), with more recent economic realities (chapter 4), and education (chapter 5). The key concepts of m&#257;tauranga M&#257;ori, kaupapa M&#257;ori theory, and m&#257;tauranga-a-iwi, as well as being grounded in a 'real', environmentally-located base, must be viewed as inseparable strands working collectively to enhance the understanding of the other. The indivisible strands are presented in a diagrammatic form (chapter 3). By mapping the complexities of what is m&#257;tauranga T&#363;hoe (chapter 8) this thesis illustrates the level of detailed understanding that needs to be included in the education system in order for m&#257;tauranga-a-iwi and kaupapa M&#257;ori theory to be properly understood and engaged for M&#257;ori educational success.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5639</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fluoride Emissions from Aluminium Electrolysis Cells</field><field name="creator">Patterson, Edwin Campbell</field><field name="description">Modern aluminium electrolysis cells generate between 15 to 40 kg fluoride per tonne of aluminium fluoride produced. This represent a large material recycle load, of which over 99% of this fluoride content is returned to the cell via a dry scrubbing system. Most past research has concentrated on increasing the efficiency of this end scrubbing system, neglecting the actual cause of the fluoride emissions. Lower emissions would reduce this loading, resulting in smaller scrubbing systems, and ultimately lower capital costs. Fluoride emissions also contribute to the changes in heat balance in the cell. The fluoride evolved represents a material loss that requires to be replaced with AlF3. The addition of this species is a major variable in cell heat balance instability [1]. Overall a better understanding of the contributors to fluoride generation in an aluminium cell would benefit the operation and economics of an aluminium smelter. Past studies [2-6] have identified most of the important emission contributors to hydrogen fluoride (HF) generation. Two sources were shown to be significant. The most studied source was primary HF generation. This is HF generation from electrolytic reactions between constituents of the fluoride based electrolyte and water from the fed alumina and hydrogen in the anode. Overlooked in some studies were generation reactions outside the electrolyte - defined in this study as secondary HF generation. This source was found to occur mainly from hydrolysis reactions with the generated particulate fluorides. However the results and the relative contributions from these studies are not strictly applicable to the current generation scenario. The present smelting practices and technology, dry scrubbing technology and raw material specifications differ substantially from those used during the period of each past investigation. The present study was designed to identify and quantify emission sources for the current smelter technology and practices. This used controlled laboratory based studies of the individual generation sources complemented by in plant studies analysing the HF emission from production aluminium electrolysis cells. It was shown that the main contributor to primary HF generation is the addition of water to the electrolyte from the feed alumina. This results in the cyclic short term variations in HF emission, which correlate to the rate of alumina addition to the cell. Laboratory and industrial studies show that only a fraction of the added water reacts. The water reacted is likely the structural water of the alumina. The adsorbed water is thought to be flashed off before addition to the bath. Depending on feeding technology and crust integrity, between 10 to 50% of this water can react. This produces 7 to 14 kgF/tonneAl. This makes it the most significant emission component. The remainder of this structural water is either entrained in the anode gases or forms part of the electrolyte dissolved water content. Dissolved water generation is the second most significant primary generation contributor, and third most significant emission component. Dissolved water is in equilibrium with the alumina content of the bath. It represents a constant emission source. Depending on feeding technology and cell design, the emission can vary between 3 to 10 kgF/tonneAl. The final primary HF emission contributor results from electrolytic generation of the hydrogen content of the anode. Laboratory studies found the emission to have a reaction efficiency of approximately 10%. This results in a small emission, of 2 &#8211; 5 kg/tonneAl. The remainder of the hydrogen content is expected to be entrained in the anode gases, as the generation of this CO/CO2 mixture is an order of magnitude greater than the HF generation reaction. Secondary generation of hydrogen fluoride is also a significant HF emission source. In an industrial cell this results from mainly thermal hydrolysis of the particulate fluoride emissions at the crust&#8211;air interface. Laboratory studies have shown that other identified secondary emission sources are unlikely due to the ambient conditions and feeding practices in a modern prebake aluminium electrolysis cell. Hence previously proposed generation from hydrolysis of the particulates in the ducts and desorption of the surface fluoride from the fed secondary alumina, have been found to be insignificant compared to the main HF generation sources. The thermal hydrolysis emission contributor is the only significant secondary generation emission component. Industrial measurements show that it varies with ambient humidity and crust integrity, two parameters which vary constantly in a modern prebake anode cell. Measurements show that the emission from this source is responsible for 2 to 8 kgF/tonneAl. This makes it the second highest HF emission component. Control of the crust condition and feeder hole states reduces this component significantly. Hence in a modern prebake aluminium cell, the most significant operational factors affecting emission are related mainly to secondary generation. Industrial measurements show that the long term variations in an emission result from changes in the ambient humidity and the cells crust cover. Control of the crust integrity is thus paramount in reducing such variations. This relates both to normal operation and batch operations. Reduction of all other sources of emission are a material composition problem. Simply reducing the water content (LOI(300) and LOI(1000)) and reducing the hydrogen content of the anodes will reduce the emission. However material considerations affect other aspects of cell operation and hence these factors are not as simple to adjust.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5662</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Aspects of adolescent obesity in New Zealand: quality of life, psychosocial factors and psychological theory</field><field name="creator">Carne, Sarah S.</field><field name="description">Purpose: To ascertain the quality of life (QOL) in an adolescent population with a high prevalence of obesity, compare findings to previous research, and  investigate psychosocial factors that may account for differences in results by  use of psychological theory.

His greatest poem, "The Prelude" had as its subject matter the growth of his own poetic mind; something that can also be understood as the growth of his 'imagination'. His friend and fellow poet, later turned philosopher, Samuel Taylor Coleridge developed a novel and romantic understanding of 'the Imagination' in the early years of his friendship with Wordsworth. He identified Wordsworth's genius, as a poet, as the product of a particularly gifted imagination, something he conceived of as an innate ability. In this thesis I challenge this 'Romantic' representation of Wordsworth's genius, one that has become canonical, largely as a result of Coleridge's treatment of Wordsworth, Poetry and Imagination in "Biographia Literaria". In making a more detailed analysis of Wordsworth's own claims about his identity, his poetic art, and imagination, I develop an argument that proposes a very different ethos to the one still largely considered normative in English Studies. The argument depends on a better recognition of Wordsworth's Classical Republican sympathies in the 1790s, and the extent to which the example of the famous Roman statesman, orator, philosopher, and poet, Marcus Tullius Cicero captured Wordsworth's imagination. Contrary to those who would romanticise Wordsworth's genius, I suggest his best work was the product of a theory of poetry based on principles that defined a very classical ideology. My argument builds on the work of recent, more detailed, representations of Wordsworth as a historical subject whose ideas were defined by particular historical circumstances, and whose identity developed out of those experiences. In addition to paying more attention to the 'historical' Wordsworth, I have also made a detailed analysis of his language, discovering the existence of a particular idiom. Wordsworth's vocabulary reflects, not only a classical humanist ideology, but also strong Stoic sentiments and an attitude of Socratic, Academic Scepticism. I trace the source of this characteristic idiom back to the influence of Cicero whose works, along with Marcus Quintilian's "De Institutione Oratoria" defined key aspects of Wordsworth's poetic theory in the late 1790s and early 1800s.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5677</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Enfance et d&#233;racinement: Nathalie Sarraute, Romain Gary</field><field name="creator">Diver, Ruth Louise</field><field name="description">Cette th&#232;se examine les enjeux associ&#233;s au d&#233;racinement culturel v&#233;cu dans l&#8217;enfance et ses effets sur la cr&#233;ativit&#233; dans la vie adulte.

However, only limited information on tissue function can be obtained with current clinical techniques. This Thesis developed and investigated novel parameters of both global and regional myocardial function, using cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with three-dimensional tissue tagging. Multidirectional peak myocardial shortening strains and strain rates, as well as the peak systolic displacement and velocity of the mitral valve annulus plane (MVP), were considered as parameters of LV systolic function. The corresponding peak diastolic strain relaxation rates and peak diastolic MVP velocity were used to assess diastolic function. The effects of normal ageing were studied in people with no evidence of cardiac disease, and compared with the effects of disease in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM). In normal healthy subjects, systolic strain parameters were preserved, while diastolic parameters were impaired, with age. DM patients showed impaired diastolic function on correction for age, and systolic functional parameters were also impaired, even though LV ejection fraction was normal. MVP systolic and diastolic motion were reduced both with age and in DM patients. Systolic LV torsion was increased with age and in DM, with no corresponding increase in torsional relaxation. Both systolic and diastolic function parameters were regionally heterogeneous. With normal ageing, diastolic function was impaired in a regionally non-uniform manner. Thus, a complete assessment of LV function requires measurement of LV tissue mechanics as well as chamber haemodynamics. MRI provides valuable information regarding myocardial tissue behaviour, contributing to systolic and/or diastolic dysfunction, which cannot be obtained otherwise. Systolic tissue dysfunction may develop concomitantly in patients with diastolic dysfunction, even when global ejection fraction is preserved. Regional analyses provide important information on how local changes contribute to global function. The influence of age must be taken into account in studies of disease.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5715</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A developmental comparison of voltage-activated Ca2+ channels and group I metabotropic glutamate receptors in oculomotor and hypoglossal motoneurons</field><field name="creator">Miles, Gareth B.</field><field name="description">Voltage-activated Ca2+ channels and group I metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) are important determinants of neuronal excitability and repetitive discharge behaviour. They are also implicated in perinatal developmental processes and Ca2+ -dependent excitotoxic cascades thought to contribute to neurodegeneration. To understand the role that these channels/receptor systems play in the physiology, ontogeny and pathophysiology of MNs, it is necessary to characterise them, during development, in MNs that differ functionally in the behaviours they control, the firing behaviour they produce, their rate of maturation, and their vulnerability to degeneration in ALS. Surprisingly few studies, however, have characterised these channels/receptor systems in MNs, particularly beyond early postnatal stages. I therefore compared voltage-activated Ca2+ channels and group I mGluRs in brain slices from neonate (P1-5) and juvenile (P14-19) rat, in oculomotor (III) and hypoglossal (XII) MNs using whole-cell patch-clamp recording and immunohistochemical techniques. III MNs innervate extraocular muscles, control eye movements that are not fully functional in rat until 2 weeks postnatal, fire at high frequency for sustained periods, and are resistant in ALS. In contrast, XII MNs innervate tongue muscles, control behaviours that are functional at birth, fire bursts of low frequency action potentials, and are vulnerable to degeneration in ALS. In neonates, low voltage-activated (LVA) Ca2+ current densities are similar in III and XII MNs but high voltage-activated (HVA) Ca2+ current densities are ~2-fold higher in XII MNs. While N- and P/Q-type HVA Ca2+ channels are present in both MN pools, greater expression of P/Q-type channels in XII MNs accounts for their greater HVA Ca2+ currents. Developmentally, LVA and HVA Ca2+ current densities decrease ~2-fold by P14-19 in III MNs, but remain unchanged in XII MNs. Thus, in juveniles the HVA Ca2+ current density is ~3-fold greater and the LVA ca2+ current density ~2-fold greater in XII compared to III MNs. The group I mGluR agonist, DHPG, induces inward currents in III and XII MNs of neonatal and juvenile rat, which are mediated by the reduction of a resting K+ conductance. Antagonism of these currents by the mGluR1 antagonist LY367385, but not the mGluR5 antagonist MPEP, and immunohistochemical labelling for mGluR1a but not mGluR5 protein on III and XII MNs, suggest that currents primarily result from the activation of mGluR1. In neonatal rat the current density of DHPG-induced currents is similar between III and XII MNs. However, in juvenile rat DHPG-induced current density is ~3-fold greater in XII compared with III MNs. Differential expression of LVA and HVA Ca2+ currents and varying effects of group I mGluR activation in III and XII MNs during development supports a role for these channels and receptor systems in determining the distinct firing patterns of these two different classes of MNs. The greater voltage-activated Ca2+ currents and group I mGluR-mediated effects in XII MNs, particularly in juvenile MNs, may also contribute to the greater sensitivity of XII MNs to pathophysiological processes, predisposing them to degeneration as seen in ALS.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5716</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Life history and demography of the pipi, Paphies australis (Bivalvia: Mesodesmatidae) in northeastern New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Hooker, Simon Holloway.</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the life history characteristics of the New Zealand pipi (Paphies australis) from gametogenesis, through spawning, larval development, settlement, juvenile recruitment patterns, distribution and abundance patterns, population size structure and growth characteristics from the Whangateau Harbour, in northeastern New Zealand. The thesis concludes by integrating this information into a model, based on hydrographic information and post settlement movement in order to help explain the observed patterns of distribution and abundance of juvenile and adult pipi in the Whangateau Harbour. The temporal pattern of the reproductive cycle of pipi was investigated over two years (May 1991 - April 1993). Samples of pipi gonads were processed using standard histological techniques, and the resultant sections placed into six developmental categories (early active, late active, mature, partially spawned and indeterminate). Gametogenesis was similar in both years, beginning in autumn with most pi pi in early active stages of development. By late winter many pipi were mature. Spawning commenced in early spring and continued through spring and summer. From a sample of 104 pi pi collected in spring 1992 for investigation into the length at sexual maturity, all pipi were found to be sexually mature above 40 mm shell length, but some individuals between 30-40 mm also had gonads with sex cells present. This sample had a sex ratio significantly biased towards females. Further analysis revealed that juveniles (below 40 mm shell length) had a significantly higher proportion of females than males, but adults (above 40 mm shell length) had a sex ratio of approximately 1: 1. No evidence of hermaphroditism was observed. The spatial pattern of the reproductive cycle of pipi was also investigated over one year (February 1992 to January 1993) at three subtidal sites using the same techniques as for the temporal study, but with one further category (parasitised). The reproductive cycle was similar between sites, with an extended spawning period . of late winter to summer. It was concluded that the reproductive cycle of pipi in the Whangateau Harbour was synchronised at all three sites sampled. A visual maturity index gave the same overall pattern of reproductive cycle as the histological analysis, but was found to be inaccurate mainly due to a poor recognition of the mature stages. It was concluded that the visual index was of limited value in accurately assessing the maturity of an individual. The sex ratio of adult pipi was not significantly different from 1: 1. A small percentage (0.87%) of pi pi were infected by a digenetic trematode fluke that, in most cases, totally castrated the individual. The larval development of pipi was described from larval culture experiments. Pi pi were conditioned, spawned and the resultant larvae reared to settlement in the laboratory. Adult pipi were successfully conditioned after 23 days at 22&#176;C. Spawning was accomplished using a combination of increased temperature and a dilute sperm solution. Settlement occurred 18-22 days after spawning at a mean shell length of 264 Ilm . After settlement and metamorphosis pi pi gradually began to take on the adult shape. Cultured juveniles were grown to 37 mm shell length both in the laboratory and later in the wild. Once in the wild, cultured pipi grew from 13 mm to 37 mm in 17 months with a strong seasonal component to their growth. Microscopic examination revealed slight differences in shell morphology between pi pi larvae and the closely related tuatua (Paphies subtriangu/ata) and toheroa (Paphies ventricosa). Pi pi were more rounded and smaller than both tuatua and toheroa at a similar stage of development. The results of scanning electron microscope examination of larval shell hinge structure confirmed previous preliminary findings for pipi. The larval shell ligament is posterior to the centre of the provinculum in pipi but central in both the tuatua and toheroa. These differences are sufficient to enable larval pipi to be distinguished from larval toheroa and tuatua. The spatial and temporal patterns of distribution and abundance of pipi were measured from November 1991 to January 1994. Previous information had suggested that pipi were a mainly intertidal species, but this study found that they can occur in large numbers subtidally. Temporal sampling was carried out by systematically measuring the abundance of pipi found within three subtidal grids. Abundances were compared within and between the grids. The subtidal population was extremely dense (up to 4400 m-2 ), with well defined boundaries. Pipi densities at the edges of the beds dropped from many hundreds to zero m-2 within 2 to 3 m. Large numbers of juvenile pi pi &#171;30 mm) were present at the start of sampling and the density of these decreased during the sampling period. Juvenile pipi occurred at high density at the harbour entrance site, but were rare or absent at the other two sites further up the harbour. Small scale distribution (ie. within a grid) at the harbour entrance showed high variability which was linked to large swells from storms, observed only at this site. The advantages of systematic sampling compared with random or haphazard sampling are discussed. The population size structure, growth and small scale movement patterns of pipi, were also studied. Pi pi formed a continuous bed from the harbour entrance up the main subtidal channel, and extended approximately one kilometre upstream. Pi pi had different shell morphologies at different sites within the harbour, and population size structure differed among sites. Small pi pi were found at either end of the subtidal pi pi bed but were absent from the middle. Analysis of length-frequency distributions indicated that there had been a large recruitment of pipi prior to the commencement of the study, but little further recruitment occurred during 1992 to 1994. Pipi took approximately three to four years to reach the population maximum size of 55-60 mm shell length. Tagged pipi, constrained in suspended nets grew more slowly than predicted from population length-frequency analysis, but tagged pi pi that were returned to the sediment grew as predicted. Localised movement of tagged pipi showed that pi pi gradually move into the centre (deeper part) of the channel and towards the harbour entrance. Adult and juvenile pipi, were observed drifting in mid-water, in the Whangateau Harbour. The animals were buoyed up by the secretion of long mucus threads which extended out through their siphons. Quantitative information from netting experiments over a period of five months from May 1993 to September 1993, collected a total of 509 drifting pipi. These were mainly juveniles &#171;15 mm shell length) but a small number of adults (up to 58 mm shell length) were also collected. The numbers of pi pi caught was highly variable, however, there was a trend for more drifting pipi to be caught on the flood tide (n=386) than the ebb tide (n=123). Overall there was little difference in the number of pipi caught between spring (n=263) and neap tides (n=246), however, this was heavily influenced by one neap tide in May 1993 (n=207). Three other bivalve species (So/etellina sp, Gari stangeri, Macomona . lilliana) were also caught drifting. Pipi were also observed to attach themselves to debris, such as dead branches of trees, which then moved them with the tidal currents. Large epiphytic algal growths on the shell also acted to buoy individuals which moved them around in tidal currents. It is hypothesised that mucus drifting in pipi is an active process, adopted for movement to other areas triggered by very high densities (over 4000 m2 ) in the harbour entrance. Finally, the distribution and size structure of the pi pi population was described by a simple model, based on the post-settlement movement of pi pi and tidal current patterns. Pipi recruits &#171;5 mm shell length) were found to be largely restricted to a small strip, mid-intertidally in clean coarse sediments. Juvenile pi pi (5-35 mm) were found at a low intertidal site directly downstream of the recruitment site. Further downstream of this site, at a subtidal site at the harbour entrance both juvenile and adult pi pi were found. A similar population size structure was found at the innermost extent of the pi pi bed in the main channel. Adult pi pi were abundant in the central part of the pi pi bed, but no juveniles were found at this site. It was concluded that post-settlement movement patterns could account for the distribution patterns of pipi in the Whangateau Harbour. If subsequently found to be of more general applicability, this model provides a powerful, predictive tool for managing pipi population and possibly other infaunal clams. This study provides, for the first time, a detailed description of the distribution and abundance of an entire pipi population from one harbour. This information allows a more informed management of pi pi populations around New Zealand. It also provides a framework in which more indepth questions about the ecology of pipi populations (and other bivalve populations) can be more clearly addressed.</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5758</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Science and reason</field><field name="creator">Williams, David Leslie Fairfax</field><field name="description">In this thesis we attempt to undercut the debate between those who argue that because humans are rational and moral creatures it follows that they have to be viewed and studied in a different way to (other) natural beings, and those who argue that because humans are natural beings they can be viewed and studied in much the same way as other natural beings.

The requirement of proteins Alg8 and Alg44, encoded by their respective genes in the alginate biosynthesis gene cluster, for alginate biosynthesis of P. aeruginosa was demonstrated, since deletion mutants were unable to produce or polymerise alginate. AlgX deletion mutants failed to produce the alginate characteristic mucoid phenotype, but showed low concentrations of uronic acid monomers in the culture supernatants. Complementation experiments using PCR based approaches were used to determine the complementing ORF and all deletion mutants could be complemented to at least wildtype levels by introducing a plasmid harbouring the respective gene. Increased copy numbers of Alg44 did not impact on the amount of alginate produced, whereas increased copy numbers of the alg8 gene led to an at least 10 fold stronger alginate production impacting on biofilm structure and stability. Topological analysis using reporter protein fusions and subsequent subcellular fractionation experiments revealed that Alg8 is located in the cytoplasmic membrane and contains at least 4 transmembrane helices, 3 of them at its C terminus. Its large cytosolic loop showed similarities to inverting glycosyltransferases and the similarities were used to generate a threading model using SpsA, a glycosyltransferase involved in spore coat formation of B. subtilis, as a template. Site-directed mutagenesis confirmed the importance of identified motifs commonly detected in glycosyltransferases. Inactivation of the DXD motif, which has been shown to be involved in nucleotide sugar binding, led to loss-offunction mutants of Alg8 and further replacements revealed putative candidates for the catalytic residue(s). Contradicting the commonly reported prediction of being a transmembrane protein, Alg44 was shown to be a periplasmic protein. The highest specific alkaline phosphatase activity of its fusion protein could be detected in the periplasmic fraction and not in the insoluble membrane fraction. Bioinformatical analysis of Alg44 revealed structural similarities of its N terminus to PilZ domains, shown to bind cyclic-di-GMP, and of its C terminus to MexA, a membrane fusion protein involved in multi-drug efflux systems. Thus, it was suggested that Alg44 has a regulatory role for alginate biosynthesis in bridging the periplasm and connecting outer and cytoplasmic membrane components. AlgX was shown to interact with MucD, a periplasmic serine protease or chaperone homologue, and is suggested to exert its impact on alginate production via MucD interaction. In vitro alginate polymerisation assays revealed that alginate production requires protein components of the outer and cytoplasmic membrane as well as the periplasm, and these data were used to construct a model describing a multi-enzyme, membrane and periplasm spanning complex for alginate polymerisation, modification and export.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">pseudomonas aeruginosa</field><field name="subject">alginates</field><field name="subject">biosynthesis</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270300 Microbiology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/735</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Accelerating classifier training using AdaBoost within cascades of boosted ensembles : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Computer Sciences at Massey University, Auckland, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Susnjak, Teo</field><field name="description">This thesis seeks to address current problems encountered when training classifiers within the framework of cascades of boosted ensembles (CoBE). At present, a signifi- cant challenge facing this framework are inordinate classifier training runtimes. In some cases, it can take days or weeks (Viola and Jones, 2004; Verschae et al., 2008) to train a classifier. The protracted training runtimes are an obstacle to the wider use of this framework (Brubaker et al., 2006). They also hinder the process of producing effective object detection applications and make the testing of new theories and algorithms, as well as verifications of others research, a considerable challenge (McCane and Novins, 2003). An additional shortcoming of the CoBE framework is its limited ability to train clas- sifiers incrementally. Presently, the most reliable method of integrating new dataset in- formation into an existing classifier, is to re-train a classifier from beginning using the combined new and old datasets. This process is inefficient. It lacks scalability and dis- cards valuable information learned in previous training. To deal with these challenges, this thesis extends on the research by Barczak et al. (2008), and presents alternative CoBE frameworks for training classifiers. The alterna- tive frameworks reduce training runtimes by an order of magnitude over common CoBE frameworks and introduce additional tractability to the process. They achieve this, while preserving the generalization ability of their classifiers. This research also introduces a new framework for incrementally training CoBE clas- sifiers and shows how this can be done without re-training classifiers from beginning. However, the incremental framework for CoBEs has some limitations. Although it is able to improve the positive detection rates of existing classifiers, currently it is unable to lower their false detection rates.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">CoBE framework</field><field name="subject">classifiers</field><field name="subject">classification algorithms</field><field name="subject">machine learning</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences::280200 Artificial Intelligence and Signal and Image Processing::280212 Neural networks, genetic algorithms and fuzzy logic</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1002</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Bach pack : independent energy solution : a written component completed in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Masters of Design at Massey University, College of Creative Arts, Wellington, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Bowie, Charlotte</field><field name="description">Atelierworkshop is an innovative Wellington based architectural practice that has advanced into the area of off- site manufacture of container-based housing solutions.

This trans-disciplinary design project responds &#8211; operating between fashion, performance and film &#8211; and acts out Elaine Scarry&#8217;s contention that pain can be constructively re-made. Functioning as a metaphorical problem-solving space where the textures of inner experience are explored, this project employs fragmented narrative and theatrical re-fashioning of the environment and body to attain greater social relevance. It asks how can we reconnect with the &#8216;sovereign self&#8217; when our constitutional confidence has been eroded and how do we re-engage with the outside world once we have become psychologically estranged from it? The Interior Cinematic utilises cognitive scientist Douglas Hofstadter&#8217;s formulation of the self as a &#8216;strange loop&#8217;, and Louis A. Sass&#8217; explanation of the dissociative and recursive features of schizophrenia as a point of poetic departure for understanding the damaged and dissociated self. The lost self may seem like an end - a horrific freefall out of normal life into madness and estrangement. But it is also a beginning; the pinnacle of sensory ascendency - a beautiful, lateral, life affirming state. Through The Interior Cinematic I construct an aesthetics of reengagement: an affective pathway between these contradictory and overlapping existential poles, contending that the lost self can, in part, be recovered through a rediscovery of sensation. This work is informed by Julia Kristeva&#8217;s assertion that alienation is the kernel for empathetic re-engagement with others, as well as by Arthur Frank&#8217;s theory of narrative as a strategy to reconnect with the damaged self.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Film</field><field name="subject">Fashion</field><field name="subject">Performance</field><field name="subject">Design</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::410000 The Arts</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1293</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Yoga as an adjuvant therapy for students enrolled in special schools for disruptive behaviour</field><field name="creator">Jensen, Pauline</field><field name="description">Doctor of Philosophy</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Yoga</field><field name="subject">Disruptive Behaviour</field><field name="subject">Children</field><field name="subject">Adolescents</field><field name="subject">ADHD</field><field name="subject">Anxiety</field><field name="subject">ODD</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/6109</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ritual perspectives: an investigation into the epistemology of performance</field><field name="creator">Woods, Belinda Jane</field><field name="description">This dissertation takes the form of an inter-subjective investigation into the ritual of performance, considering its function in terms of community engagement and its place in contemporary society.

This study investigated rhizosphere P dynamics and P acquisition of three tree species with contrasting mycorrhizal associations (ectomycorrhizal Pinus radiata, arbuscular mycorrhizal Cupressus macrocarpa and tripartite Ecualyptus nitens) using a combination of field and controlled environment studies. Short-term field studies revealed greater acid phosphomonoesterase activity and therefore greater potential organic P mineralization under radiata pine and eucalypt compared with macrocarpa, which correlated with ectomycorrhizal colonization. Related field work revealed that the presence of pasture understory and litter had a significant impact on P dynamics. Pasture acts to increase phosphatase activity and microbial activity within the soil but with a litter layer, the increased activities are mainly above the soil in the overlying litter. A glasshouse study investigated the separate influence of mycorrhizal hyphae and roots and results showed that ectomycorrhizal fungi associated with radiata pine and eucalypt stimulated microbial activity and increased rhizosphere phosphatase activity with a concomitant decline in soil organic P. Macrocarpa and eucalypt roots exuded higher concentrations of low molecular weight organic anions compared with radiata pine which stimulated microbial activity, increased rhizosphere phosphatase activity and decreased soil organic P. A series of experiments were then conducted to further investigate the precise role of mycorrhizae in P dynamics and results showed that ectomycorrhizal colonization increased rhizosphere acid phosphomonoesterase to a greater extent than arbuscular mycorrhizae. Fluorescent staining revealed that the mycorrhizae associated with all three species had similar phosphatase production capacities. The ability of the three species to utilize organic P was investigated in two exhaustive pot experiments. Radiata pine was shown to be the best adapted to utilize organic P, especially in soils with high relative organic P contents. Eucalypt appeared to enhance soil organic P mineralization but did not take up the released inorganic P, while macrocarpa caused limited organic P mineralization compared with radiata pine and eucalypt. This work shows that ectomycorrhizal trees are best adapted to utilize organic P through increased rhizosphere phosphatase activity and stimulated microbial activity. Root exudation of LMWOAs is of higher relative importance to arbuscular mycorrhizal trees to increase microbial activity and consequently phosphatase activities when fewer hyphae are in the rhizosphere are present to produce them.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">organic phosphorus</field><field name="subject">phosphatase enzyme activity</field><field name="subject">mycorrhizae</field><field name="subject">Pinus radiata</field><field name="subject">Eucalyptus nitens</field><field name="subject">Cupressus macrocarpa</field><field name="subject">soil</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/1803</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Engineering geology of the Patonga Claystone, Central Coast, New South Wales, with particular reference to slaking behaviour</field><field name="creator">Nunt-jaruwong, Sorawit, School of Biological, Earth &amp; Environmental Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">The Patonga Claystone, a red bed facies in the Narrabeen Group of the Sydney Basin, is one of the most unfavorable rock units in the basin from a geotechnical point of view. This rock unit is composed of sandstone, siltstone, mudstone and claystone. One of the unfavorable characteristics is the low shear strength, which causes instability of cut slopes; another is its slaking-prone behaviour. Numerous measurements of geotechnical properties, along with extensive mineralogical and geochemical determinations, were carried out to identify cause of this slaking behaviour. Key techniques were the use of quantitative X-ray diffractometry for mineralogical analysis, and the determination of slake durability index and related properties to evaluate the slaking behaviour under both standard and more extended conditions. Standard (two cycle) slake durability test results indicate a range from low to high slake durability index values, with some mudstone samples having very low durability and some sandstones having very high slake durability indices. Jar slake test results indicate that the rock samples break rapidly and/or develop several fractures (Ij = 4) in an as-received state, but degrade to a pile of flakes or mud (Ij = 1) if the samples are oven dried before testing. The results for jar slake testing of oven-dried material are comparable, for individual samples, to those obtained from the more comprehensive slake durability tests. The mineralogy of the samples was evaluated by quantitative X-ray diffraction techniques using the Rietveld-based Siroquant processing system. Comparison to independent chemical data show a generally good level of agreement, suggesting that the mineralogical analysis  results are consistent with the chemical composition of the individual rock samples. Good correlations were also obtained between clay mineralogy determined from orientedaggregate XRD analysis of the &amp;lt2 micron fraction and the results from powder diffractometry and Siroquant analysis of the whole-rock samples. Evaluation of the slake durability characteristics and other geotechnical properties in relation to the quantitative mineralogy suggests that quartz and feldspar form a rigid framework in the rocks that resists the disruptive pressures that cause slaking. Expansion of the clay minerals by various processes, including the incorporation of water into the interlayer spaces of illite/smectite as well as changes in pore pressures associated with entry of water into micro-fractures in the clay matrix, are thought to produce the disruptions that cause slaking and degradation. An abundant clay matrix also reduces the strength of the rock materials, probably because of the less rigid nature of the clay minerals relative to the quartz and feldspar particles. As well as the mineralogy, the loss on ignition (LOI) and water absorption percentage were found to provide good indicators of longer-term slaking behaviour. Both properties are also related to the overall clay content. Rock samples with water absorption values of &amp;lt10, 10-15 and &amp;gt15% behave as highly durable, intermediate and less durable materials respectively. Rocks with LOI values of greater than 5% by weight behave as less durable rock materials, at least for the strata encompassed by the present study. The water absorption and LOI values were also used to develop a predictive model of slake durability characteristics for the different rock materials in the Patonga Claystone, providing a relatively simple basis for predicting longer-term stability in a range of geotechnical studies.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Engineering geology -- New South Wales -- Sydney Basin</field><field name="subject">Tonsteins</field><field name="subject">Sandstone -- New South Wales -- Sydney Basin</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/27335</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Equivocal empire: British community development in Central Africa, 1945-55</field><field name="creator">Kark, Daniel, History &amp; Philosophy, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis resituates the Community Development programme as the key social intervention attempted by the British Colonial Office in Africa in the late 1940s and early 1950s. A preference for planning, growing confidence in metropolitan intervention, and the gradualist determination of Fabian socialist politicians and experts resulted in a programme that stressed modernity, progressive individualism, initiative, cooperative communities and a new type of responsible citizenship. Eventual self-rule would be well-served by this new contract between colonial administrations and African citizens.  The thesis focuses on the implementation of the Mass Education programme in Nyasaland, and, more specifically, on a small but significant Mass Education scheme at Domasi, that operated between 1949 and 1954 in Nyasaland??s south. The political and social context in which the Mass Education scheme was implemented in Nyasaland is important. The approach taken by the government of the Protectorate before the mid-1940s is discussed, and previous welfare interventions described and critically assessed. The initial approach to Mass Education in Nyasaland is also dwelt upon in some detail. The narrative concentrates upon the scheme itself. Three themes emerge and are discussed successively ?? the provision of social services adapted to the perceived needs of Africans, the enforcement of environmental restrictions and inappropriate social and agricultural models, and the attempted introduction of representative local government. All three interventions were intended to promote the precepts of Mass Education, but instead resulted in the extension of state administrative power. The manner in which this occurred is explored throughout the thesis.  Mass Education at Domasi did not result in the creation of a new form of citizenship in Nyasaland. It contributed instead to a breakdown in the narrative of social development and eventual self-rule that had legitimised British rule. The riots that occurred in 1953 tore at the precepts that underpinned the Mass Education programme. The immediacy of self-rule and independence resulted in a shift in emphasis within the Colonial Office and the colonial government in Nyasaland from social intervention and to constitutional reform and political development. There simultaneously emerged a new rural transcript, one that privileged open opposition to the colonial social prescription over subtle and hidden rural resistance. At a time when nationalist politics was in disarray in Nyasaland, rural Africans spoke back to colonial power.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">British Africa</field><field name="subject">Mass Education</field><field name="subject">Community Development</field><field name="subject">colonial</field><field name="subject">malawi</field><field name="subject">Community development -- Africa</field><field name="subject">Great Britain -- Social policy</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41225</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of systematic increase in pozzolanic materials on the mechanical, durability, and microstructural characteristics of concrete</field><field name="creator">Ahmed, Mohammad Sharfuddin, Aerospace, Civil &amp; Mechanical Engineering, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">The use of high performance concrete in construction has been enhanced by the use of pozzolanic materials. However, the use of these materials has not been optimized. Such optimization may be achieved by a systematic increase in the amount and combination of pozzolanic material additions, with accompanying studies of their effects on the mechanical, durability and microstructural characteristics of blended concrete. This work evaluated various concrete durability issues by studying systematic increases of pozzolanic materials such as fly ash and blast furnace slag (BFS) in the range of 25, 50 and 70%, and silica fume at 10% of total cementitious materials, forming various binary and ternary concrete blends. The concrete specimens were cured for a period of seven days after demoulding in line with widely practiced commercial curing procedures. The research explored the role and effectiveness of various binary and ternary blends of pozzolanic materials on the mechanical, durability and microstructural characteristics of concrete. Durability was evaluated by two independent rapid chloride permeability tests measured as charge passed and chloride conductivity from the RCPT and UCT tests respectively. These two rapid tests were coupled with long-term ponding tests to evaluate chloride ingress and the extent of corrosion for a period of two years. Further durability tests such as carbonation, drying shrinkage and porosity of these blends were also undertaken. This study also utilized micro-analytical techniques such as X-ray diffraction and Scanning Electron Microscopy to follow the hydration mechanism in various binary and ternary blends. Statistical significance testing was used to analyse and confirm all experimental results and conclusions. It is well known that a level of caution is exercised in the construction industry in the use of ternary blends. This study aims to evaluate the durability aspects of ternary concrete blends, in addition to binary blends, for resistance to chloride, corrosion, carbonation attacks and provide recommendations relating to the limits of blending level, as well as exposure conditions for blended concretes, based on the results of this study. It is expected that this will fill a major knowledge gap observed in the concrete industry. A comparison of two rapid chloride permeability tests such as UCT and RCPT indicates that the UCT test is easy and practicable, and does not contradict results obtained in the standard RCPT. However, the statistical significance of results obtained for some blends was only able to be established by using the RCPT. This effect can be attributed to the larger size specimens compared to UCT. The recommended blend to acquire both early-age and long-term strength development in fly ash is the ternary blends comprising 10% silica fume and 25% fly ash cast using lower w/b ratio. In addition, the same blend exhibited lower carbonation depth, lower charge passed from RCPT, lower chloride ingress and higher corrosion resistance characteristics from long-term ponding test compared to other blends of fly ash. In BFS blends, an increase in compressive strength was observed only in the specimens of 25% BFS compared to other higher percentage blends, while the higher addition of 50 and 70% replacement showed no significant difference in compressive strength between them and their corresponding ternary blends with addition of silica fume. The results of this study indicate that control (OPC) specimens cast with increased w/b ratio of 0.48 showed higher chloride ingress compared to both binary blends of 70% fly ash and 70% BFS specimens. This indicates that (OPC) cast using higher w/b ratio is to be avoided in chloride environments. On the other hand, though, the ternary blends of 10% silica fume and up to 50% fly ash exhibited lower chloride ingress compared to their respective binary blends of fly ash. However, these ternary blends exhibited lower compressive strength, more negative corrosion potential and higher corrosion rate, compared to the respective binary blends of 25% fly ash and its ternary blends. Therefore, the recommended blend observed in the long-term ponding test is the ternary blend of 25% fly ash and 10% silica fume. The recommended level of corrosion resistance in slag specimens is achieved by the use of ternary blends comprising silica fume at 10% added to the blend that contains up to 70% slag. However, the recommended level of slag for a lower carbonation effect is the use of a ternary blend comprising 50% slag and 10% silica fume (3B5S1) which showed a carbonation depth of 10.8 mm and a compressive strength of 53.2 MPa after 365 days of exposure. The drying shrinkage of concrete increased with the increase in fly ash and the same trend was observed in BFS specimens. However, the results were not significantly different between their respective blends. The extent of carbonation in fly ash specimens was higher compared to BFS blends specimens. This can be attributed to the formation of dusty and weak surfaces on the outer surface in addition to the excessive leaching of sodium chloride solution from the long-term ponding test in the former specimens compared to later. The high volume pozzolanic materials, irrespective of fly ash or BFS and addition of silica fume (70% fly ash and 10% silica fume, and 70% BFS and 10% silica fume), showed higher cumulative pore volume indicating that these blends with seven days of curing were not beneficial. These high volume ternary blends required prolonged curing to release portlandite from the hydration of cement to continue the pozzolanic reaction. This study has shown that 7-days curing of the pozzolanic concrete is inadequate if pozzolanic activity is to be invoked. This is particularly the case when it is expected that the concrete is likely to be subjected to a harsher than usual environment characterised by a dry atmosphere.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">concert</field><field name="subject">durability</field><field name="subject">additives</field><field name="subject">pozzolanic</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38645</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Unnatural production of natural products: Heterologous expression and combinatorial biosynthesis of cyanobacterial-derived compounds</field><field name="creator">Roberts, Alexandra Anne, Biotechnology &amp; Biomolecular Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Cyanobacteria produce a myriad of structurally unique secondary metabolites with useful bioactive properties. Heterologous expression of a variety of microbial natural compounds has been used to harness their diversity and facilitate their combinatorial biosynthesis. However, these genetic techniques have not been developed for secondary metabolite-producing cyanobacteria. Therefore the genetically manipulable Escherichia coli and Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 were engineered in order to develop effective heterologous hosts and promoters for the expression of cyanobacterial-derived compounds. The phosphopanthetheinyl transferase (PPT), Sppt, from Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 was characterised to determine its ability to activate carrier proteins from secondary metabolite pathways. Despite in silico evidence which suggested Sppt was able to activate a wide range of carrier proteins, biochemical analysis revealed that it is dedicated for fatty acid synthesis. Consequently, E. coli and Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 were engineered to encode a broad-range PPT, from the filamentous cyanobacteria Nodularia spumigena NSOR10, for the activation of carrier proteins from nonribosomal peptide synthesis. Cyanobacterial natural product engineering was also explored with the characterisation of two relaxed specificity adenylation domains (A-domains) from the biosynthetic pathway of the toxin microcystin. The wide variety of microcystin compounds produced by cyanobacterial species suggests that multiple amino acids can be activated by the same A-domain. This was supported by preliminary ATP-[32P]PPi exchange assays and was subsequently harnessed in the production of a variety of dipeptides using two reconstituted modules in vitro. Transposition was investigated as a potential mechanism for the transfer of nonribosomal peptide synthetase gene clusters to heterologous hosts. This was performed via the characterisation of the putative transposase, Mat, physically linked with the microcystin synthetase gene cluster (mcyS). PCR screening, in silico analysis and nitrocellulose filter binding assays indicated that this transposase may have mediated mcyS gene cluster rearrangements but not entire gene cluster mobilisation between species. The potential role of transposases in the natural combinatorial biosynthesis of microcystin has evolutionary implications for the dynamic nature of cyanobacterial genomes and applications for use in the engineering of novel bioactive compounds. Therefore, the results from this study may provide a biotechnological platform for the transfer, expression and combinatorial biosynthesis of novel cyanobacterial-derived natural products.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Phosphopantetheinyl transferase</field><field name="subject">Cyanobacteria</field><field name="subject">Transposase</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41533</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Document management and retrieval for specialised domains: an evolutionary user-based approach</field><field name="creator">Kim, Mihye, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Browsing marked-up documents by traversing hyperlinks has become probably the most important means by which documents are accessed, both via the World Wide Web (WWW) and organisational Intranets. However, there is a pressing demand for document management and retrieval systems to deal appropriately with the massive number of documents available. There are two classes of solution: general search engines, whether for the WWW or an Intranet, which make little use of specific domain knowledge or hand-crafted specialised systems which are costly to build and maintain. The aim of this thesis was to develop a document management and retrieval system suitable for small communities as well as individuals in specialised domains on the Web. The aim was to allow users to easily create and maintain their own organisation of documents while ensuring continual improvement in the retrieval performance of the system as it evolves. The system developed is based on the free annotation of documents by users and is browsed using the concept lattice of Formal Concept Analysis (FCA). A number of annotation support tools were developed to aid the annotation process so that a suitable system evolved. Experiments were conducted in using the system to assist in finding staff and student home pages at the School of Computer Science and Engineering, University of New South Wales. Results indicated that the annotation tools provided a good level of assistance so that documents were easily organised and a lattice-based browsing structure that evolves in an ad hoc fashion provided good efficiency in retrieval performance. An interesting result suggested that although an established external taxonomy can be useful in proposing annotation terms, users appear to be very selective in their use of terms proposed. Results also supported the hypothesis that the concept lattice of FCA helped take users beyond a narrow search to find other useful documents. In general, lattice-based browsing was considered as a more helpful method than Boolean queries or hierarchical browsing for searching a specialised domain. We conclude that the concept lattice of Formal Concept Analysis, supported by annotation techniques is a useful way of supporting the flexible open management of documents required by individuals, small communities and in specialised domains. It seems likely that this approach can be readily integrated with other developments such as further improvements in search engines and the use of semantically marked-up documents, and provide a unique advantage in supporting autonomous management of documents by individuals and groups - in a way that is closely aligned with the autonomy of the WWW.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Information retrieval</field><field name="subject">Database management</field><field name="subject">Lattice theory</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/19183</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Single-electron transistors for detection of charge motion in the solid state</field><field name="creator">Brenner, Rolf, Physics, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">This work investigates advanced single-electron transistor (SET) devices for detection of charge motion in solid-state systems. In particular, novel, nanoscale twin-SET and double-island SET (DISET) detectors are introduced as sensitive charge detectors. Some advantages over conventional SET detectors in terms of noise performance, sensitivity and versatility are pointed out. With the prospect of present, transistor-based microelectronics facing serious limitations due to quantum effects and heat dissipation, alternative computing paradigms ??? such as quantum computers, quantum-dot cellular automata and single-electronics ??? have emerged, promising an extension of highlevel integration and computing power beyond the above limitations. The most promising proposals are based on solid-state systems, and readout of a computational result often requires ultra-sensitive charge detectors capable of sensing the motion of single charges on fast timescales. SETs have been shown to combine all these qualities. However, random fluctuations of the background charge in solid-state systems can affect SETs and cause errors during readout. A twin-SET detector is presented that consists of two independent SETs, which were used to detect controlled single electron transfers on a small, floating metal double-dot. By cross-correlating the two SET signals, rejection of random charge noise is successfully demonstrated, thus decreasing the error probability during readout. Detection of single-electron transfer in a double-dot is also demonstrated using a double-island SET. In addition, conductance suppression in this novel DISET detector allows the detection of electrostatically degenerate charge con- figurations of a double-dot, which cannot be achieved with single-island SETs. We consider the noise performance of the DISET, and an intuitive definition of the DISET charge sensitivity suggests that under certain conditions, DISETs can have a better charge sensitivity than conventional SETs, which would be attractive for quantum limited measurements. Finally we present the first study of a DISET operated at radio-frequencies (rf-DISET), compatible with charge detection on ms timescales. This capability is a prerequisite when reading out the charge state of quantum mechanical systems. A very good charge sensitivity (5.6 x 10i6 e/pHz) and noise temperature (2.1 K) of the rf-DISET setup are reported.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Transistors</field><field name="subject">Detectors</field><field name="subject">Solid state physics</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/20533</field></doc><doc><field name="title">States of unrest: photography and trauma</field><field name="creator">Peterson, Tanya, Art, College of Fine Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">States of Unrest: Photography and Trauma is an interdisciplinary study of the dialectic between photography and trauma.

The framework of the study is developed through a close reading of three different manifestations of war-related images as a way of considering the language, circulation, and impact of traumatic images. It considers this field, firstly, in terms of the function of domestic photography produced during the time of World War II; secondly, in relation to photographic documentation of the Vietnam War; and thirdly, through imagery made in response to the ongoing war in Afghanistan. It examines the relationship between photography and trauma in terms of theories of absence and presence, ultimately arguing in favour of a model of understanding based on a surplus economy of meaning, as opposed to a framing of absence.

The dissolution rate was deduced from the measured changes in concentration of oxides in slag with respect to reaction time. The experimental set- up was initially tested with dissolution of magnesia in the CaO ??? 55 wt% Al2O3 slag at 1430 ??C and a measured rate of 2.7 ??10 -5 g/cm2.s was obtained. The dissolution rate was increased by slag chemistry and ranged from 6.5??10-5 to 2.1??10-4 g/cm2.s. The dissolution rate of CaO was measured in CaO ??? 42 wt% Al2O3 ??? 8% SiO2 based slag. The measured dissolution rates were found to be strongly dependent on the slag chemistry and temperature and ranged from 5.03??10 -5 to 3.3??10 -4 g/cm2.s. The dissolution rates were strongly dependent on the rotation speed and results indicate mass transfer in the slag phase to be rate- limiting step. The diffusivity of MgO / CaO was calculated from the dissolution rate and solubility data, using known mass transfer correlations. The diffusivity of MgO in the calcium aluminate slag at 1430 ??C was found to be about 1.1??10-5 cm2/s. Additions of 5 and 10 wt% Fe2O3 increased the diffusivity by a factor ~ 1.5 to 3, respectively. However, with introduction of (CaF2 5 wt% + Fe2O3 5 wt%) and (CaF2 5 wt% + Fe2O3 10 wt%) in the slag, the diffusivity increased considerably by a factor of about 29 and 11, respectively. The diffusivity of CaO in calcium aluminosilicate was measured to be in the order of 10-6 to 10-5 over a temperature range of 1430 ??? 1600 ??C. CaF2 increased the diffusivity by a factor of 3 to 5 while MnOx and FeOx, ilmenite and TiO 2 increased the diffusivity substantially and SiO2 had an opposite effect. The measured diffusivities are in accord with published data on comparable systems and are discussed with reference to Eyring theory. It was concluded that MnOx, FeOx and ilmenite in the slag increase the dissolution rate and diffusivity of lime, showing comparable results with respect to CaF2.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">slag</field><field name="subject">steel</field><field name="subject">lime</field><field name="subject">flux (metallurgy).</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/22469</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluating the effectiveness of Australian aid to Samoa</field><field name="creator">Hamblin, William John, School of Sociology, UNSW</field><field name="description">On a global basis over A$450 billion is invested each year in foreign direct investment and aid with a view to supporting development. Developing countries themselves allocate significant sums out of their own budgets in order to stimulate development. Development is concomitantly a major goal and enterprise of the global economy. Developed countries through aid (Official Development Assistance) spend large sums purportedly to improve the development status of developing countries. Recently voices from within the developed world???s establishment have derided the performance of aid and by default the performance of state organisations charged with managing aid delivery. Australia has not been immune from this criticism. Its aid program while modest by global standards still consumes A$1.5 billion in taxpayers money each year. Australian aid is delivered primarily by the Australian International Aid Agency (AusAID) with smaller contributions through the Department of Foreign Affairs, Department of Defence and Australian Federal Police. AusAID has recently faced severe criticism over failure of the aid investment in the South Pacific to engender development. Most South Pacific countries (excluding Fiji and Samoa) have failed to show desired development. A number have faced bankruptcy (Naru, Solomon Islands), while others have increasing lawlessness (Papua New Guinea). It is important in the above milieu to examine the delivery mechanisms of Australian aid through its chosen vehicle (AusAID) and determine whether aid has really been effective or not. This thesis reviews the development effectiveness of Australian aid in one Pacific island nation ??? Samoa. In this context, the effectiveness of Australian development assistance is reviewed in terms of the results of four case studies of project aid to Samoa. The four case studies cover a range of project activity in differing sectors and offer specific insights into aid policy and delivery and the effects other variables such as culture, history and development status have on development outcomes. The thesis tests the hypothesis that Australian aid to Samoa has resulted in only limited development success and then in ways that are not generally sustainable. In confirming the hypothesis, this thesis identifies that while variables such as the procedural and policy underpinnings of the Australian aid program, aid design/delivery and management, and the history, culture and development status of Samoa impact on the development outcomes, they do not prohibit development. This thesis concludes that development outcomes will be maximised when there are good macro policies present, sound sector policies and real commitments of the government and people to development. Moreover, this thesis finds that while development theories inform the debate over aid none successfully encapsulates  the actual development process.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Please verify keywords.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/22896</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fundamental investigation of slag/carbon interactions in electric arc furnace steelmaking process</field><field name="creator">Rahman, Muhammad Mahfuzur, Materials Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">This work investigates the interactions of carbonaceous materials (metallurgical coke, natural graphite and HDPE/coke blends) with three EAF slags [FeO: 24% to 32%]. Experiments were conducted using the sessile drop technique (1500??C-1600??C) with off-gases (CO, CO2) measured using an IR analyzer; the wetting behaviour was determined from contact angle measurements. Estimation of slag foaming behaviour was determined from the droplet volume changes calculated using specialized software. At 1550??C, all slags were non-wetting with coke due to increased surface tension due to sulphur. At 1550??C, slag 1 was initially non-wetting on natural graphite due to gas entrapment in the slag droplet; the wetting improved after that. Other slags showed comparatively better wetting. At 1600??C, all slags were non-wetting with coke. Slags showed a shift from non-wetting to wetting behaviour with natural graphite. Slag/coke reactions produced high off-gases levels causing extensive FeO reduction; gas entrapment in the slag was poor (small volume droplets). Slag/natural graphite interactions revealed both slow gas generation rates and FeO reduction, and excellent gas entrapment (higher droplet volumes) with minor changes in slag properties due to low ash levels. The iron oxide reduction rates were determined to be 1.54x10-5 and 4.2x10-6 mol.cm-2/sec (Slag 1, 1550??C) for metallurgical coke and natural graphite respectively. Slag interactions with coke/HDPE blends showed increasing off-gas levels with increasing HDPE levels. Blend#3 produced the highest off-gas levels, extensive FeO reduction and displayed significantly higher slag foaming and better wetting compared to coke. Our line on trends compared well for slag/carbon interactions and resulted in deceased specific energy consumption and carbon usage and increased productivity. These findings have enhanced the possibility of utilizing polymeric wastes in blends with coke in EAF steelmaking for slag/carbon interactions.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Slag foaming injectant</field><field name="subject">EAF steelmaking</field><field name="subject">Slag foaming</field><field name="subject">Gas generation</field><field name="subject">Met.

However, a lack of implementation strategies has hindered widespread translation of the guidelines into practice and little research has been conducted on developing and testing implementation strategies. The aim of this research was to develop an implementation model of CVAR assessment and management in Australian general practice. It consisted of development and feasibility studies, which were carried out in three phases. In Phase 1, I conducted focus groups and interviews to explore the views of general practitioners (GPs), patients and key informants on how the CVAR assessment and management should be implemented. My themes were based on a literature review, research done in preparation for this study, and relevant theoretical models. Key findings were used to develop a multi-strategy CVAR implementation model encompassing appropriate patient selection and preparation as well as the conduct of appropriate CVAR assessment and management. In Phase 2, using mixed methods research, I explored the application of the model and its impact on GPs and patients. This confirmed that appropriate patient selection, use of a patient self-assessment (SA) form, electronic CVAR calculator and management guideline, length of consultation, and training of GPs to develop skills in communicating CVAR results and in shared decision making (SDM) were important in improving CVAR assessment and management, and supporting patient involvement and active self-management. In Phase 3, using mixed methods research (including consultation recording analysis), I focused on the detailed process and content of CVAR consultations. This showed that at least 15 minutes??? consultation may be necessary. Quantifying the CVAR score using an electronic calculator was important to help motivate patients. Greater emphasis was needed in GP training on use of the patient SA form, SDM and intensification of medications and referrals in response to patient???s high CVAR. Barriers to referral also need to be addressed.  This research demonstrated that the proposed implementation model was feasible in promoting the better use of CVAR assessment and management. This has important implications for future research, practice and policy. Further research is needed to investigate the effectiveness of the proposed model in reducing CVD risk and improving clinical outcomes and its applicability in other cultures and contexts.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Management</field><field name="subject">Cardiovascular absolute risk</field><field name="subject">Assessment</field><field name="subject">General practice</field><field name="subject">Implementation</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44799</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Role of the Sydney Medically Supervised Injecting Centre in reducing injecting drug use-related harm: evaluating accessibility, utilisation, coverage and selected health impacts</field><field name="creator">Kimber, Joanne, Public Health &amp; Community Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Drug Consumption Rooms (DCRs), where injecting drug users (IDUs) can use pre-obtained drugs in a hygienic and professionally supervised low threshold setting, aim to engage high risk IDUs, reduce public drug use, injecting-related morbidity and mortality, and improve access to drug treatment. This thesis evaluates the service demand, accessibility, utilisation, and coverage of Australia???s first DCR, the Sydney Medically Supervised Injecting Centre (MSIC), located in an area with a history of illegal shooting gallery operation. MSIC impact on injecting practices and injecting related health, and referral to drug treatment were also examined. Methods included cross-sectional IDU surveys, key informant interviews, staff focus groups, analysis of client registration and surveillance data and routinely collected data on needles and syringes - including multiple indirect prevalence estimation, and prospective follow-up of MSIC referrals. Shooting gallery users expressed demand for and willingness to use the MSIC. Injecting episodes previously occurring in shooting galleries appear to have been transferred to the MSIC, although shooting galleries continued to operate at a reduced level. The MSIC service model was accessible, with few refusals of entry, high levels of client satisfaction and limited non-use for reasons relating to the model. MSIC engaged high risk IDUs - regular injectors, sex workers, and those injecting in public places and shooting galleries - who were also more likely to be frequent attendees. MSIC clients were more likely than other IDUs to inject in public places and shooting galleries, be HCV seropositive, have riskier injecting practices and more severe injecting related health problems. MSIC achieved good coverage of the local IDU population (70.7%, range 59.1%-86.7%) and modest coverage of their estimated total injecting episodes during its operating hours (8.8%, range 7.3%-10.8%). MSIC use was associated with improvements in injecting practices and health. Frequent MSIC use was also associated with higher rates of referral to drug treatment than less frequent use. Drug treatment referral uptake was positively associated with a recent history of daily injection and sex work and negatively associated with a lifetime history of psychiatric treatment and/or self harm. This research was confounded by substantial changes in heroin availability during the study period but provides new evidence on DCR coverage, impact on injecting practices and health, and referral to drug treatment. Implications for future research are discussed.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Narcotics addicts - Services for - New South Wales - Sydney</field><field name="subject">Injections, Intravenous - Health aspects - New South Wales - Sydney</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23038</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Heidegger and the problem of individuation: Mitsein (being-with), ethics and responsibility</field><field name="creator">Sorial, Sarah, School of Philosophy, UNSW</field><field name="description">The argument of this thesis is that Heideggerian individuation does not constitute another form of solipsism and is not incongruent with Heidegger???s account of Mitsein (beingwith). By demonstrating how individuation is bound up with Mitsein I will also argue that this concept of individuation contains an ethics, conceived here as responsibility for one???s Being/existence that nevertheless implicates others. By tracing the trajectory of Heidegger???s thinking from Being and Time to the later text, Time and Being, I want to suggest that the meditation on Being and its relation to Dasein as an individual contains an ethical moment. Ethics, not conceived of as a series of proscriptions, in terms of the Kantian Categorical Imperative for example. Nor ethics conceived in terms of an obligation to and responsibility for another, as in Levinasian ethics, but an ethics in terms of responsibility for existence, and more specifically, for one???s own existence. The ethical moment in Heidegger, I argue, is not one as ambitious as changing the world or assuming infinite and numerous obligations on behalf of others. It is, rather, a question of changing oneself. It is a question of assuming responsibility in response to the call of Being. I will show how, given that Dasein is always Mitsein, others are situated in such an ethics. Central to the thesis is an examination of the relation between indivduation and Mitsein. While Heidegger is always careful to distinguish his form of individuation from other accounts of individuation or solipsism, such as those of Rene Descartes, Immanuel Kant or Edmund Husserl???s, Heidegger???s conception of solipsism and its relation to his account  of Mitsein remains somewhat obscure. As a consequence, there are several problems that this concept raises, all of which have been the subject of much debate. At the centre of this debate is the apparent tension between the concept of individuation and the notion that ontologically, Dasein is also a Mitsein. This tension has led to a number of interpretations, which either argue that the concept of individuation is inconsistent with the notion of Mitsein, or that it constitutes yet another instance of Cartesian subjectivity and that as a consequence, it is inherently unethical. This thesis contributes to this debate by submitting that the concept of individuation, while primary or central to Heidegger???s ontology, is not in tension with his account of Mitsein. I use Jean-Luc Nancy???s paradoxical logic of the singular to argue for this claim. I suggest that it is precisely this concept of individuation that can inform an ethics and theory of political action on account of the emphasis on individual responsibility. The second part of my argument, also made with the aid of Nancy, is that this can inform an ethics and a theory of political action, not at level of making moral judgements, or yielding standards of right and wrong, but at the level of individual and by implication, collective responsibility for one???s own existence. Given that there is no real separation between the ontic and ontological levels in Heidegger???s work, a taking responsibility at the level of one???s own Being will invariably play itself out ontically in factical life in terms of moral responsibility and judgement. I explore the concrete political implications of this through an examination of Heidegger???s account of freedom. I argue that Heidegger???s removal of freedom from the  ontology of self-presence and his alternative conception of it provides us with a way of thinking freedom not in terms of a specific set of rights, but as a mode of being-in-theworld and as the basis for collective political action. I use the work of Hannah Arendt to develop a theory of political action, freedom and judgment from this revisionary conception of freedom.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Heidegger, Martin, 1889-1976</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23966</field></doc><doc><field name="title">IQM-CMM : information quality management capability maturity model</field><field name="creator">Baskarada, Sasa</field><field name="description">This research makes a significant contribution to existing information quality management theory by identifying a large number of relevant maturity indicators and mapping them to a staged evolutionary capability maturity model.

This knowledge has motivated substantial research and development into wireless signal transmission which today is competitive with traditional conductive cabling systems. Power transfer across air gaps, however, has seen more modest development and has tended to be restricted to electric machines that have tight magnetic couplings. It is only very recently that a novel technique termed IPT (Inductive Power Transfer) has made power delivery to movable objects across large air gaps a practical reality. A typical IPT system comprises a primary power converter supplying high frequency alternating current to a conductive track loop with multiple secondary power pick-up circuits loosely coupled to it. IPT employs modern power conversion, control, and magnetic coupling techniques to achieve clean and reliable power transfer without direct electrical contact. Many practical applications have been found for IPT in materials handing, lighting, and transportation systems. One of the major constraints, however, is the primary power supply, particularly at high power levels and when power transfer over large distances is required. In this thesis selected resonant converters suitable for IPT power supplies are investigated using mathematical analysis, computer simulations and practical experiments. The basic characteristics and underlying principles of the converters are studied in order to determine their dynamic performance and power transfer capability. Special attention is given to improving existing IPT power supplies while investigating new power converters in order to achieve high efficiency and reliable operation at reduced cost. The current-fed parallel resonant converter power supply has been the basis of most commercial applications to date. It has a high efficiency and produces good voltage and current waveforms. However, both the track length that it can drive and the power level it can operate at are limited and the system may vary in frequency if the track resonant circuit and the pick-up load are not carefully designed. As a result, this supply, in its simple form, is only suitable for short track lengths and low power applications. The voltage-fed series ii quasi-resonant converter power supply controls the frequency directly and is capable of driving longer track lengths as a result of series compensation employed in the track loop. However, its voltage and current waveforms contain more harmonics, and while high efficiency may be achieved with soft switching, the condition is very dependent on the track compensation and is difficult to meet during start-up and shut down transients. In consequence, this supply is suitable for medium track lengths and medium power level applications. Improved current-fed and voltage-fed IPT power supplies are proposed in this thesis. They have the most preferred track current properties, including constant magnitude and nearly pure sine wave characteristics. Despite the circuit complexity and high system cost involved, these supplies are ideally suitable for long track lengths and high power applications. A novel converter based on free oscillation and energy injection control is also presented and shown to be capable of achieving high frequency AC power generation at very low switching frequencies while reducing the system cost. As such it is appealing for long track length, high track current, high frequency, and low voltage source applications. Finally, a very simple converter based on self-sustained oscillation without an external controller is demonstrated at low operating voltages, and a cost-effective option to overcome the start-up problems exhibited by most IPT power supplies at high voltages is shown with excellent dynamic zero voltage switching performance.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Engineering, Electronics and Electrical (0544)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Brush cutting and brush fencing : sustainable resource use or environmental impoverishment?</field><field name="creator">Newland, Nicholas.</field><field name="description">Includes bibliographical references.</field><field name="date">1991</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation">SUA</field><field name="subject">Melaleuca Harvesting</field><field name="subject">Clearing of land Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://web4.library.adelaide.edu.au/theses/09ENV/09envn549.pdf</field><field name="identifier">NBD:8526699</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Narratives of otherness: Masculinity and identity in contemporary Spanish literature for children and adolescents</field><field name="creator">Davies, Faye Margarita</field><field name="description">While members of any group of men may appear to be ordinary gendered examples of humanity, behind their physical similarities lie many socio-political and familial differences; thus it is only by knowing such men as individuals that their identities are revealed. Such is the aim of this thesis: to discover the 'real man' behind the statistics about sex-roles and the predominance of male characters in children's and adolescents' literature. From within a selection of Spanish texts a variety of male characters are analysed, focusing on six major roles: father, grandfather, imaginary friend, detective, outlaw or similar marginalised man, and foreign other, with particular attention paid to the Gypsy.    All the chapters are linked by the Bakhtinian theory that dialogue with the other leads to the development of a character's or potential reader's sense of identity. The first chapter, concerning fatherhood, is related to a person's sense of intrinsic identity, given with their name and genetic heritage. The grandfather represents a similar sense of family continuity, as well as enabling the young reader to understand Spain's recent historical and rural past. An imaginary friend may symbolise an aspect of identity concerned with a child's ability to achieve a goal or to occupy a special place within the family. Detective stories are analogous to the young person's developing identity as a reader able to decipher the mysteries of texts, whilst marginalised men typify children themselves: persons who have neither status nor money, but who are able to indulge in carnivalistic behaviour which adults call 'play.' The development of one's sense of national identity is fomented through interaction with texts about foreigners who have contributed to Spain's growth as a nation from pre-historic times to the present.    A brief critical evaluation of the role of women in detective fiction and as marginalised figures is offered by way of contrast in the appropriate chapters. The thesis concludes that, when analysed as individuals, many male characters demonstrate traits not traditionally considered masculine, and that it is necessary to look beyond mere representations of gender in judging the value of characters in literature for children and adolescents.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">LITERATURE, ROMANCE (0313)</field><field name="subject">EDUCATION, READING (0535)</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420300 Cultural Studies::420303 Culture, gender, sexuality</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/4</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Pier scour countermeasures</field><field name="creator">Lauchlan, Christine Sandra</field><field name="description">Riprap is the most commonly employed countermeasure where bridge piers need to be protected against possible undermining by scour. An extensive review of available design techniques revealed a wide range of equations and proposed design procedures but no generally accepted method for riprap sizing and implementation. The aim of this study was to develop a design procedure for riprap protection at piers which can be used in most river environments.    The failure mechanisms and stability of riprap layers around cylindrical and rectangular shaped piers were examined in a comprehensive experimental study. The study assessed the importance of various riprap, flow, sediment, and pier parameters. Parameters for investigation were determined by dimensional analysis and included riprap placement and arrangement.    A riprap size prediction formula was developed based on an allowable maximum local scour depth of up to 20%. This equation has been incorporated in a design approach which was tested through a model study of the Hutt Estuary Bridge. The influence of various parameters on riprap stability are incorporated in the equation by way of adjustment factors.    The adjustment factors, KY and KD, represent the effects of riprap placement and pier/sediment size ratio effects respectively. They were deemed the most important parameters in riprap layer performance and are therefore included in the riprap size prediction formula. Additional experiments using synthetic filters have shown their ability to eliminate local scour, however they are susceptible to failure under degrading bed conditions.    Degrading bed conditions cause the riprap to subside as a layer with the downward movement of the surrounding bed. Subsidence allows the layer to withstand rapid short term degradation. However long term degradation will ultimately result in failure of the stone protection.    A preliminary experimental study of the use of submerged vanes as a scour countermeasure was performed. Submerged vanes have been used previously in channel protection with much success. Results indicate that vanes with a length to height ratio greater than one can reduce the maximum local scour depth in live bed conditions by as much as 34%. Further testing is required to develop a complete design procedure.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ENGINEERING, CIVIL (0543)</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290800 Civil Engineering::290801 Structural engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The transformation of Mangere Hospital: A case study in deinstitutionalisation</field><field name="creator">Levien, Janett</field><field name="description">This thesis is an analysis and evaluation of a case study in deinstitutionalisation of people with intellectual disabilities. The process has been viewed as an example of organisational change and the focus is on the relationship between formal and informal caregivers and the notion of care. Three key groups were included in the study, families of residents, the residents and staff.    A qualitative approach was taken. The theoretical perspective that was developed attempted to account for links between social movements, organisations and individual experience in the arena of intellectual disability. This was based on the approach of New Institutionalism in organisational theory. The focus was primarily on the process--of change, and in caregiving.    Three models of intellectual disability, which have informed policy and the recent changes to a preference for community care, have been identified and the links between these and the elements of organisations developed for providing care explored. The experience of families and residents within the hospital setting and then the community care setting has been examined in relation to the nature of the organisation.    Outcomes for the three groups have been examined in terms of their needs and the extent to which these needs were met by the arrangements over a given time. It is concluded that community care has the potential to better meet the needs of those involved, than has hospital based care. A number of factors in the process of change and in the delivery of care have been identified as impacting on outcomes for those involved. Consideration is given to the practical implications of these findings.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">HEALTH SCIENCES, HEALTH CARE MANAGEMENT (0769)</field><field name="subject">HEALTH SCIENCES, PUBLIC HEALTH (0573)</field><field name="subject">SOCIOLOGY, INDIVIDUAL AND FAMILY STUDIES (0628)</field><field name="subject">HEALTH SCIENCES, MENTAL HEALTH (0347)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/6</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Systematic opportunistic screening for type 2 diabetes in general practice</field><field name="creator">Kenealy, Timothy William</field><field name="description">Some 70,000 people in New Zealand may have undiagnosed diabetes. This study aims to develop &#8216;systematic opportunistic screening&#8217; for diabetes, testing people attending a general practitioner (GP) for some other reason, and to trial this process with Auckland GPs. The literature on how to change doctor behaviour is reviewed for both theoretical perspectives and empirical evidence. Two of the most promising strategies are computer reminders within a medical consultation and having patients influence doctors. Literature reviews cover GP attitudes to diabetes, guidelines and preventive care and the role of a computer in a GP consultation.    The Mail Survey (response rate 154/212, 72.6%) reports GP attitudes to guidelines and preventive care. Factor analysis showed five &#8216;guidelines&#8217; factors and two &#8216;preventive care&#8217; factors that might indicate differential motivations to screening for diabetes.    The Focus Group Study, of 35 GPs in 5 groups, discussed guidelines, diabetes and computer reminders in a consultation. The analysis suggested that GPs would respond to a patient reminder and may respond to a computer reminder to screen for diabetes.    The Screening Reminder Trial involved 107 GPs randomly allocated across four interventions: Computer reminders, Patient reminders, Both and Usual care. The main outcome measures were whether a patient who was eligible for diabetes screening and who visited a GP during the trial had a glucose test done within the trial. The trial ran for two months. Analysis was by intention-to-treat and allowed for clustering by GP. Compared with the Usual care group (screening rate 15.5%), the Odds Ratio of eligible patients being screened were; Computer group OR 2.55 (1.68-3.88), Patient group OR 1.72 (1.21-2.43) and Both group OR 1.69 (1.11-2.59). The Computer reminders were more acceptable to GPs than were the Patient intervention. The findings suggest that a simple computer reminder can implement systematic opportunistic screening for diabetes in New Zealand. If all GPs in New Zealand used the computer reminders for one year, some 8000 patients might benefit from having their diabetes treated for five years longer than they would have under &#8216;usual care&#8217;.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">HEALTH SCIENCES, MEDICINE AND SURGERY (0564)</field><field name="subject">HEALTH SCIENCES, HEALTH CARE MANAGEMENT (0769)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/7</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Language learning strategy use and proficiency: The relationship between patterns of reported language learning strategy (LLS) use by speakers of other languages (SOL) and proficiency with implications for the teaching/learning situation</field><field name="creator">Griffiths, Carol</field><field name="description">This thesis begins with the premise that strategies are important if students are to learn effectively, and that this applies no less to language than to any other field of learning. After issues of terminology and definition are addressed, there is a discussion of the theoretical underpinnings of the language learning strategy concept. Since the concept of proficiency is also central to the thesis, issues relating to the definition and assessment of proficiency are considered before previous research in the language learning strategy field is reviewed. This research was carried out in three stages in a private language school in Auckland, New Zealand. Part A, Section 1 used the Strategy Inventory for Language Learning (SILL) (Oxford, 1990) as the basic instrument to investigate the relationship between language learning strategies and proficiency and to examine the strategy patterns used by more proficient students. Part A, Section 2 used the same data to investigate language learning strategy use according to learner variables (nationality, gender, age). Part B used interviews to investigate language learning strategy use by individuals and Part C used a classroom based programme to explore means of instructing students in language learning strategy use and also to construct an original questionnaire using student input (the English Language Learning Strategy Inventory or ELLSI). This questionnaire was used to further investigate the relationship between language learning strategy use and proficiency and also changes in strategy use over time as well as teachers&#8217; perspectives on language learning strategy use. The results of the SILL phase of the study revealed a significant relationship between language learning strategies and proficiency (a finding supported by the results of the ELLSI study) and also significant differences in strategy use according to nationality, while the interviews revealed some useful insights regarding the use of language learning strategies by individuals. From the longitudinal section of the study it was found that those students who made the most progress were the ones who most increased the frequency of their language learning strategy use. The results of the teachers&#8217; survey indicated that teachers regarded language learning strategies as highly important, an encouraging result in terms of positive implications for a good accord between teachers and students in the teaching/learning situation. The classroom programme, however, aimed at exploring ways to promote language learning strategy use among students, was only a lukewarm success and much work remains to be done to find ways of making insights regarding language learning strategies available to students. The thesis concludes by bringing together the key findings and suggesting areas for further research.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">LANGUAGE, LINGUISTICS (0290)</field><field name="subject">EDUCATION, LANGUAGE AND LITERATURE (0279)</field><field name="subject">EDUCATION, BILINGUAL AND MULTICULTURAL (0282)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/9</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Identification and characterisation of a novel integrin beta subunit: Beta 7</field><field name="creator">Yuan, Qian</field><field name="description">The identification of a novel human integrin $/beta$ subunit, $/beta/sb7$, has been reported in this dissertation. The full-length human $/beta/sb7$ cDNA contains 2798 nucleotides encoding a single long open reading frame of 798 amino acid residues of which 708 are extracellular and 52 are cytoplasmic. The human $/beta/sb7$ sequence displays strong homology with other integrin $/beta$ subunits, being most related to $/beta/sb2$. Cell distribution studies suggest that the expression of transcripts encoding the human $/beta/sb7$ subunit is restricted to leukocytes. This study was the first to show that the cysteine-rich repeats of the human integrin $/beta/sb7$ subunit and other integrin $/beta$ subunits are related to domain III of the laminin B chains. Furthermore, the integrin $/beta$ subunit and laminin cysteine-rich repeats are each related to the epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like repeats found in a growing number of adhesion molecules and regulatory proteins.    The mouse homologue of the human $/beta/sb7$ subunit has also been cloned in this study, and it shares 87% amino acid identity with the human $/beta/sb7$ sequence. The mouse $/beta/sb7$ mRNA transcripts, like that of the human $/beta/sb7$, have a predominantly leukocyte-restricted expression, but in some haematopoietic lineage cell lines, in addition to the predominant 3 kb transcript, a less abundant 2 kb transcript is also detectable. Cultured mouse skin epithelial cells contain only the 2 kb transcript.    The genes encoding the human and mouse $/beta/sb7$ subunits were mapped to human chromosome 12 (ITGB7) and mouse chromosome 15 (Itgb-7). The Itgb-7 gene was localised to the distal part of mouse chromosome 15, and exists in the gene order: Myc-Wnt-1-Itgb-1.    The N-terminal 13 amino acids of the mature mouse $/beta/sb7$ subunit was shown to be identical to a 13 amino acid N-terminal sequence reported for the Mr 120,000 $/beta$ subunit of the M290 antigen, which is found highly expressed on mouse intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes (IEL). This finding suggests that the integrin $/beta/sb7$ subunit may play important roles in IEL migration, and immunosurveillance in the gut mucosa.</field><field name="date">1992</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">HEALTH SCIENCES, IMMUNOLOGY (0982)</field><field name="subject">BIOLOGY, MOLECULAR (0307)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/10</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A conceptual model for sustainability (John Berger)</field><field name="creator">Wanden-Hannay (nee Witten-Hannah), Shalema</field><field name="description">The ideas of Berger are used in this thesis to explore humankind's struggle to achieve greater sustainability. In his descriptions of the peasantry and modern high-energy cultures of progress Berger insightfully crystallises and represents graphically the observation made by many authors writing in different contexts and from within various disciplines that there have been two fundamentally different systems of beliefs and values in history. His conception of &#8216; cultures of survival&#8217; and &#8216;cultures of progress &#8217; is used in this thesis to develop a conceptual model for sustainability.    The basic idea underlying the conceptual model for sustainability is that cultural systems self-regulate or self-correct as they strive to achieve balance in their relationship to higher systems levels of the biosphere, while improving quality of life. Over large time scales self-regulation takes the form of quite radical transformations in cultural system's key defining beliefs and values. The model holds that the process of self-regulation results in societies moving back and forth along a cultural continuum of beliefs and values, represented at one end by Berger's cultures of survival and at the other by his cultures of progress. This system of self-regulation is fraught with risks arising from factors like the inherently conservative nature of cultural systems, which reduce the fit or alignment between systems of beliefs and values and their context and in doing so generate un-sustainability. The model suggests that over large spans of time movement back and forth along the cultural continuum creates the dynamic balance needed to achieve greater sustainability, at least if irreversible degradation of the biosphere's life-supporting systems and extinction can be avoided. This conceptual model for sustainability demonstrates the validity of the central hypothesis of the thesis, which is that Berger's ideas in the &#8216;Historical Afterword&#8217; to &#8216;Pig Earth&#8217; are important and have a valuable contribution to make to the discourse on sustainability.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES (0768)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/11</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The coexistence of DS-CDMA mobile radio systems and fixed services</field><field name="creator">Marshall, Philip John</field><field name="description">Analytical techniques are developed for predicting the performance of outdoor and in-building DS-CDMA mobile radio systems and fixed services sharing the same spectrum. The mobile radio and inter-system propagation characteristics are represented by a log-normally distributed distance dependent path-loss. For simplicity, the received signal variability attributable to multi-path fading is ignored.    The mobile radio system performance is estimated using outage probability expressions, where an outage is defined to occur when the momentary BER exceeds a specified threshold rate. The in-building and outdoor mobile radio systems are assumed to use power control and the composite interference is assumed to be Gaussian distributed at the mobile radio receivers.    Outage probability expressions which predict the performance of a fixed service sharing spectrum with a mobile radio system are developed. The fixed service is assumed to experience occasional multi-path fading attributable to unusual tropospheric conditions. The maximum tolerable mobile radio interference at a fixed service receiver depends on the performance requirements of the service. However a commonly used Standard which requires that the INR is less than -16dB has been adopted in this Thesis, and therefore an outage is defined to occur when the CNR ratio is less than the minimum required for reliable reception, or when the INR exceeds -16dB.    Sufficient electromagnetic isolation between fixed and mobile systems sharing the same spectrum may be achieved using excision suppression techniques or by geographically separating the two systems. Excision suppression techniques will have a detrimental effect on the performance of a mobile radio system unless the fixed service signal is sufficiently narrow-band. The geographical separation distances required for spectrum sharing between fixed services, and outdoor and in-building DS-CDMA mobile radio systems are presented. The fixed services are assumed to be similar to those operating in New Zealand in the 1.7-2.3 GHz frequency bands. Mobile radio systems with 5, 10, 15 and 48 MHz channels are considered. It is shown that, for the systems considered, the geographical separation required between the two systems depends largely on the mobile radio and inter-system propagation characteristics, and the mobile radio and fixed service transmission powers.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ENGINEERING, ELECTRONICS AND ELECTRICAL (0544)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/12</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Lines in space:  Freedom and the search for truth in the novels of Alfred Andersch</field><field name="creator">Purdie, Catherine Marie</field><field name="description">Through an analysis of the four novels Sansibar  (1957), Die Rote (196 1), Efraim (1967) and Winterspelt (1974), this thesis explores the development of the principles of freedom and truth upheld by the characters in Sansibar into the concept of the artistic outline found in the later novels. Crucial to an understanding of this is the Sartre quotation in Winterspelt . According to Sartre's &#8216;original project&#8217;, the individual human being starts off life as a rough outline, which lives itself subjectively, filtering objective reality through its own preconceptions and thus experiencing nothing which is not part of these preconceptions. As a painter creates an outline on a blank canvas, so we create the outline of our own lives and determin our destiny.    In Andersch's novels, which are set against the existential void, the fate of the characters is never predetermined; rather, it is the individual's line of thinking which determines his or her course of action, and determines the nature of his or her relationships with others. As Andersch's characters become more aware of their freedom as human beings, they are able to develop conscious artistic outlines and so turn the existential void into a place of freedom. This thesis looks at four closely interrelated aspects of the artistic outline: &#8216;Lines of Thought&#8217;, &#8216;The Development of Outlines&#8217;, &#8216;New Directions&#8217; and &#8216;Co-existence and convergence: the individual artistic outline as part of a whole&#8217;. By showing the development of these aspects across the four novels, it draws conclusions not only about Alfred Andersch's development as a writer but also about his vision of humanity.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">LITERATURE, GERMANIC (0311)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/13</field></doc><doc><field name="title">General equilibrium analysis of Sri Lanka's trade liberalization policy options</field><field name="creator">Tennakoon, Kadupitige Upalinie Ajitha</field><field name="description">Sri Lanka's trade regime has been gradually liberalized over the last two decades with the aim of deeper integration into the global economy. The purpose of this study is to present a quantitative assessment of the impacts of major unilateral, regional and multilateral trade liberalization on Sri Lanka, and rank the trade policy options in terms of their welfare effects. This study contributes to the empirical literature on trade liberalization. The Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) model is used to analyze the welfare effects of trade liberalization in a multi-country, multi-sector general equilibrium framework. The results show that if Sri Lanka implements the South Asian Free Trade Agreement (SAFTA), while maintaining 15 percent external tariffs for the rest of the world, this combined policy would provide the highest welfare gain to Sri Lanka. The SAFTA by its own would provide the second-highest ranked gain from the trade reforms due to the benefits of preferential access to the large SAARC market. The third-highest ranked policy option comes under the unilateral reduction of import tariffs to 15 percent scenario. As results indicate, the Indo-Lanka Free Trade Agreement (ILFTA) offers the fourth-highest policy option for Sri Lanka. Finally, the phasing-out of MFA on Textiles and Clothing under the Uruguay Round Agreement, rank as the fifth-highest policy option for Sri Lanka. Thus, regional trade liberalization is far more preferable to unilateral and multilateral liberalization. However, as the GTAP model permits, these rankings based on only to the static welfare gains, ignoring the dynamic effect of trade liberalization.    In addition, the gravity model has been employed to examine the determinants of Sri Lanka's bilateral trade flows with her selected trading partners, in order to sort out the influence of geographical proximity versus preferential trading policies in creating a regional concentration in trade. Our results confirm the validity of geographical factors such as proximity and cultural familiarity, as determinants of Sri Lanka's trade with neighbouring countries. They suggest that the selected trading partners are &#8220;natural trading partners&#8221; of Sri Lanka.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">POLITICAL SCIENCE, INTERNATIONAL LAW AND RELATIONS (0616)</field><field name="subject">ECONOMICS, GENERAL (0501)</field><field name="subject">ECONOMICS, COMMERCE-BUSINESS (0505)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/14</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The AtMRS2 gene family from Arabidopsis thaliana</field><field name="creator">Drummond, Revel Scott MacGregor</field><field name="description">Magnesium (Mg2+) is an essential mineral nutrient for plants and is the most abundant free divalent cation in plant cells. However, our knowledge of the role of this ion in the plant cell is limited, and the mechanisms of homeostasis and transport of the ion are almost completely unknown. A. Tutone (this laboratory) identified an Arabidopsis thaliana gene by the complementation of a Mg2+-uptake yeast mutant (CM66). This gene, referred to as AtMRS2-11, was expressed as cDNA from a strong yeast promoter and allowed the growth of the CM66 yeast strain on standard media. The conceptually translated AtMRS2-11 protein sequence was used in this study to identify nine additional proteins by sequence homology searches using the BLAST algorithm. The corresponding genes have been cloned from cDNA (A. thaliana ecotype Landsberg erecta) and sequenced. Protein sequence similarity suggests that the family forms a sub-section of the CorA super-family of Mg2+ transport proteins. The mutant yeast used to identify the family initially was also used to show that two family members in addition to AtMRS2-11 were able to complement the Mg2+-dependent growth phenotype. When fused to eGFP, these proteins showed a localisation consistent with some of the protein reaching the yeast cell membrane. The other members of the family were also fused to eGFP and showed a range of localisation patterns within the yeast cell. None of the three AtMRS2 proteins previously able to complement the yeast mutant phenotype did so when fused to eGFP. RNA transcripts from the AtMRS2 family were detected by RT-PCR in organ-scale preparations of total RNA from A. thaliana. Most family members were detected in all of the organs tested. Northern analysis of AtMRS2-11 RNA transcript level showed that the gene was more highly expressed in leaf tissue, but was not affected by decreased levels of Mg2+ in the growth media. The levels of steady state AtMRS2-11 mRNA transcript were elevated two-fold in the light during the diurnal cycle, but no change was detected during light-induced greening of etiolated seedlings. A stable transgenic A. thaliana line expressing the gusA gene from the promoter region of AtMRS2-11 was used to localise the promoter's activity to cells containing chloroplasts. The expression appeared highest in younger cells. VI The AtMRS2-11 protein was predicted to contain a chloroplast targeting peptide. Western analysis demonstrated that AtMRS2-11 was enriched in the total proteins of isolated chloroplasts as compared to extracts from whole plants. The AtMRS2-11:eGFP fusion protein was also detected in chloroplasts by fluorescence microscopy. Flame atomic absorption spectroscopy was used in conjunction with isolated chloroplasts to try to determine the effects of the overaccumulation of the AtMRS2-11 protein in a transgenic A. thaliana plant line (constructed by A. Tutone). A rapid uptake or binding of Mg2+ was seen in chloroplasts isolated from both wild type and transgenic lines, but no differences were observed in either the rate of Mg2+ uptake/binding or the final Mg2+ content.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Biology, Plant Physiology (0817)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/15</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Napier&#8217;s mathematical works</field><field name="creator">Hawkins, William Francis</field><field name="description">John Napier, born at Merchiston in 1550, published The Whole Revelation of St. John in 1594; and he appears to have regarded that theological polemic as his most important achievement. Napier's invention of logarithms (with greatly advanced spherical trigonometry) was published in 1614 as Descriptio Canonis Logarithmorum; whereupon the mathematicians of Europe instantly acclaimed Napier as the greatest of them all. In 1617 he published Rabdologiae, which explained several devices for aiding calculation: (1) numbering rods to aid multiplication (known as 'Napier's bones'); (2) other rods to aid evaluation of square and cube roots; (3) the first publication of binary arithmetic, as far as square root extraction; and (4) the Promptuary for multiplication of numbers (up to 10 digits each), which has a strong claim to be regarded as the first calculating machine. Napier's explanation of the construction of his logarithms was published posthumously in 1619 as Constructio Canonis Logarithmorum, in which he developed much of the differential calculus in order to define his logarithms as the solution of a differential equation and then constructed strict upper and lower bounds for the solution. His incomplete manuscript on arithmetic and algebra (written in the early 1590s) was published in 1839 as De Arte Logistica.    This thesis provides the first English translations of De Arte Logistica and of Rabdologiae, and it reprints Edward Wright's English translation (1616) of the Descriptio and W. R. Macdonald's English translation (1889) of the Constructio. Extensive commentaries are given on Napier's work on arithmetic, algebra, trigonometry and logarithms. The history of trigonometry is traced from ancient Babylonia and Greece through mediaeval Islam to Renaissance Europe. Napier's logarithms (and spherical trigonometry) resulted in an explosion of logarithms over most of the world, with European ships using logarithms for navigation as far as Japan by 1640.</field><field name="date">1982</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">MATHEMATICS (0405)</field><field name="subject">HISTORY OF SCIENCE (0585)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/16</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The influence of 'spiritual meaning-making' on career choice, transition and experience</field><field name="creator">Lips-Wiersma, Marjolein Silvia</field><field name="description">The focus of this inquiry is &#8220;The influence of &#8216;spiritual meaning-making&#8217; on career choice, transition and experience&#8221;. Over the past decade there has been an increase in interest in the expression of spiritual belief in work. Most of the writing on the topic is based on the premise that individuals and organisations have lost meaning, and that the problem of meaning in work needs to addressed to enhance the ways in which we organise, and to enhance organisational output and personal wellbeing. Whereas the current writing on spirituality and work often suggests that organisations should provide more meaning, this research took a more humble starting point by asking what meanings individuals with spiritual belief are currently attributing to, and discovering in, their work, and by asking how and whether these meanings determine work behaviour.    I argue in this thesis that the concept of meaning-making is central to spirituality. I reviewed the psychological literature on meaning and as a result decided to focus the inquiry on three core elements of meaning; purpose, sense-making and coherence. In order to step back from the organisational agenda, and give voice to the authenticity of diverse spiritual beliefs, I chose to use career, rather than organisational theory, as framework for this inquiry. An additional theoretical framework of &#8216;agency and communion&#8217; was introduced to conceptualise human motivation beyond its current narrow &#8216;self&#8217; and &#8216;doing&#8217; oriented definitions. A combination of &#8216;collaborative human inquiry&#8217; and &#8216;narrative&#8217; methodology was chosen to elicit subjective career meanings. Fifteen individuals with diverse spiritual beliefs participated in this research. These included a Buddhist, a Quaker, a Catholic, a Bah&#225;'&#237;, and a Mormon, as well as those not currently affiliated with an organized religion.    The findings show that spiritual belief strongly determines career choice, transition and experience. It was found that research participants, in spite of their diverse beliefs, shared four purposes: &#8216;developing and becoming self&#8217;, &#8216;union with others&#8217;, &#8216;expressing self&#8217; and &#8216;serving others&#8217;. When these purposes can be expressed fully, the workplace is experienced to be aligned with spiritual belief, and individuals are contributing fully, especially when diversity of spiritual expressions is acknowledged at the same time. Career transitions are made through an ongoing sense-making process as a result of which the individual may decide that the four purposes are no longer in balance and action is required in order to continue to live meaningfully. This sensemaking is a result of ongoing interaction between the individual and his or her work environment. Coherence is a result of the transrational element of spirituality, when the individual feels his or her work is still aligned with a bigger (divine) plan. This is assessed on an ongoing basis through prayer, asking &#8216;was this meant to be&#8217; and reframing difficulties and setbacks as opportunities for learning and development.    I suggest that it may not be wise to seek collective enactment of the trans-rational as it has no firm basis for collective organisational decision-making. It cannot seek collective expression due to the diversity of beliefs of organisational members. However I strongly suggest that an organisation that wants to align itself with the spiritual beliefs of its members, ensures that the four purposes of &#8216;developing and becoming self&#8217;, &#8216;union with others&#8217;, &#8216;expressing self&#8217; and &#8216;serving others&#8217; can be fully enacted in the organisation, keeping in mind that spirituality expresses itself in process as well as outcome.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">EDUCATION, VOCATIONAL (0747)</field><field name="subject">BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION, MANAGEMENT (0454)</field><field name="subject">PSYCHOLOGY, INDUSTRIAL (0624)</field><field name="subject">RELIGION, GENERAL (0318)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/18</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Education reforms:  The marketisation of education in New Zealand. Human capital theory and student investment decisions</field><field name="creator">Eagle, Lynne Carol</field><field name="description">This thesis traces the development of the New Zealand education reforms which began in the late 1980s from their ideological and theoretical foundations, especially those of human capital theory, through policy development and implementation. Polytechnic business programmes are used as a case study to illustrate the impact of the reforms and of one of the principal mechanisms by which the reforms were expected to be implemented-the National Framework.    Evidence is provided that leads to policy questions regarding the implementation of the Framework under the aegis of the New Zealand Qualifications Authority. These concerns include competency based learning and administration and delivery complexities. The links between the reform intentions and the actuality of implementation are also examined. The assumption that the education reforms are expected to have significant impact on the country's economic performance is examined and factors which impact on workplace organisation and productivity and which may constrain the effects of improved worker education and training are discussed. The instrument of &#8216;the market&#8217; as a means of achieving both efficiencies and effectiveness in tertiary education is also reviewed. There appears to be an absence of a common understanding of the nature, composition and behaviour of education markets.    Indicative evidence is also provided regarding the complexity of student investment decisions with regard to tertiary education decisions. This study provides evidence to support human capital theory as a force influencing the decision to undertaken tertiary education, but as part of a much more complex model of the tertiary education decision making process than it would appear that policy makers have considered.    Evidence is presented that leads to questions regarding the assumption that industry will take ownership of the reform processes. Evidence is presented of industry indifference and inertia to the reforms.    Recommendations for the re-examination of developments to date are made, together with research programmes to provide a sound empirical base for future policy making. Without a structured critical review of the reform intentions versus the emerging actuality, there is a danger that the reforms may, in part at least, prove to be both inefficient and ineffectual.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">EDUCATION, HIGHER (0745)</field><field name="subject">EDUCATION, BUSINESS (0688)</field><field name="subject">EDUCATION, FINANCE (0277)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/19</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation and comparison of the French and Austro-German schools of violoncello bowing techniques: 1785-1839</field><field name="creator">Walden, Valerie Elizabeth</field><field name="description">This study traces the development of violoncello bowing technique in France, Austria and Germany between the years 1785-1839. Using evidence obtained from contemporary violoncello methods, periodical reviews, iconographic materials, diaries, letters, musical manuscripts, first-edition performance repertoire, and first-hand research at the Library of Congress, Smithsonian Institute and University of California at Berkeley, the technical methodology of each school is examined. By this process, diverse qualities in the playing manner of J. P. Duport, J. L. Duport, Janson, Tricklir, Breval, J. H. Levasseur, Lamare, Hus-Desforges, Baudiot, Norblin, Vaslin and Franchomme, and that of A. Kraft, Ritter, Romberg, N. Kraft, Dotzauer, Lincke, Bohrer, Merk and Kummer are discernible.    Such divergences in bowing technique form the basis of dissimilarities present in French and Austro-German violoncello performance of 1785-1839, a circumstance occasioned by a variety of contributing factors. These issues are segregated for investigation. Following the Introduction, Chapters 1 and 2 provide background information regarding the development of the instrument, bow, and bowing techniques before 1785. Chapter 3 discusses design modifications that occurred to the instrument and bow between 1785 and 1839. Chapters 4 and 5 present the biographies of each of the violoncellists examined, while Chapter 6 discusses the influence of performers from the French violin school and the musician interaction brought about by the French Revolution and subsequent wars.    Analysis of the varying performance characteristics of the French and Austro-German schools begins with Chapter 7, this chapter and Chapter 8 surveying the performance methodology of each of the violoncellists included in this study. Chapters 9 and 10 assess the consequential relationship of performance technique to performance repertoire and Chapter 11 summarizes the findings of the accomplished research.    These findings detail differences in the performance methodology of the French, Austrian and German violoncello schools in the period 1785-1839. The variants evinced include the manner in which the bow and instrument were held, the type of bowing techniques incorporated into the performance repertoire of each nationality and the method of their execution, the way in which the violoncello's varying sonorities were exploited, and the regard for sound quality and volume by performers of each school.</field><field name="date">1994</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">MUSIC (0413)</field><field name="subject">EDUCATION, MUSIC (0522)</field><field name="subject">HISTORY, EUROPEAN (0335)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/20</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Species identity, genetic diversity, and molecular systematic relationships among the Ziphiidae (beaked whales)</field><field name="creator">Dalebout, Merel Louise</field><field name="description">Beaked whales (family Ziphiidae) are one of the least known of all mammalian groups. The majority of species have been described from only a handful of specimens. Found in deep ocean waters, these species are widespread and often sexually dimorphic. Little is known of intra-specific variation in morphology, and many species are very similar in external appearance. A reference database of mitochondrial DNA sequences was compiled for all 20 recognised ziphiid species to aid in species identification. All reference sequences were derived from validated specimens, which were often represented only by bone or teeth. DNA was obtained from this &#8216;historic&#8217; material using &#8216;ancient&#8217; DNA methods. For three species, holotypes were sampled. Phylogenetic analyses using this database led to the discovery of a new, previously unrecognised species of beaked whale (Mesoplodon perrini), new specimens of Longman's beaked whale (Indopacetus pacificus), a species known previously from only two partial skulls and the synonymy of a third (M. traversii = M. bahamondi).    Phylogenetic reconstructions based on sequence data from three mitochondrial and two nuclear loci (total, 2815 bp) using neighbour joining, parsimony, and maximum likelihood methods, resolved many of the sister-species relationships in this group. Inferred relationships among Mesoplodon beaked whales indicated that cranial and tooth morphology may be far more variable between closely related species than previously assumed. No support was found for a linear-progression of tooth form as suggested by Moore (1968) in his phenetic evaluation of relationships among the Ziphiidae. The geographic distribution of Mesoplodon species with similar or divergent tooth morphology is likely due to a combination of sexual selection and selection for species recognition. Both hypotheses predict similar patterns, such as dissimilar tooth morphology among species with sympatric or parapatric distributions. However, only sexual selection appears to offer an explanation for why there are so many Mesoplodon beaked whales.    Investigation of mtDNA diversity among a number of beaked whale species indicated that nucleotide diversity was generally lower in this group than in other wide-ranging oceanic cetaceans. The cause of this low diversity was not clear but may be indicative of overall low abundance. Particularly low levels of diversity were found in Baird's beaked whale Berardius bairdii , Arnoux's beaked whale B. arnuxii and the northern bottlenose whale Hyperoodon ampullatus. Strong geographic structure in haplotype frequencies was observed among a worldwide sample of Cuvier's beaked whales Ziphius cavirostris.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">BIOLOGY, GENETICS (0369)</field><field name="subject">BIOLOGY, ZOOLOGY (0472)</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270700 Ecology and Evolution::270702 Marine and estuarine ecology (incl. marine ichthyology)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/21</field></doc><doc><field name="title">O le poutu: Women's roles and Samoan language nests</field><field name="creator">Utumapu, Tafili Leahnora Peseta</field><field name="description">Samoan language nests have become well established in New Zealand due to the commitment, support and contribution of the Samoan community, the church, Samoan families, parents and most importantly the efforts of mothers. Their advent has created new settings within which or through which women's roles may become redefined. This thesis explores the questions of how relationships between Samoan language nests and family systems have developed, and how these relationships may have affected the development of roles within Samoan families, especially women's roles.    To obtain answers to these questions three theoretical frameworks were utilised. Bronfenbrenner's (1979) ecological model provided concepts for understanding the developmental changes occurring in the transitional relationships between families and language nests. The second theoretical perspective employed was Vygotsky's (1978) sociocultural framework to analyse the cultural processes developing between Samoan families and language nests. The final framework was provided by Goodnow and Collins's (1990) concept of 'parents ideas'. Their argument is that parents' ideas and style of parenting has been influenced by their own ontogenic development, and by society's expectations.    The answers to the research questions were obtained by interviewing 21 Samoan language nest supervisors in the Auckland area and 100 caregivers or parents. Samoan language nests influenced parents, mothers and their families in their awareness and affirmation of Samoan language and culture, helping with parenting skills, provided support groups and served as an opportunity to gain knowledge and skills about preschool operation and educational processes. Language nests reinforced women's maternal roles, it changed the way they related to their children and the women's support groups encouraged women to assert their rights as women. The level of commitment by women is illustrated in the ways mothers and parents contributed at the language nests. Overall 92 percent of the mothers and parents helped at the nests.    The significant contribution of women in Samoan language nests serve to affirm her as a 'poutu', the 'superwoman', the strength of her family, of the church and her community.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">EDUCATION, EARLY CHILDHOOD (0518)</field><field name="subject">WOMEN'S STUDIES (0453)</field><field name="subject">SOCIOLOGY, INDIVIDUAL AND FAMILY STUDIES (0628)</field><field name="subject">SOCIOLOGY, ETHNIC AND RACIAL STUDIES (0631)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/22</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Happily ever after:  Discourses of emotion, love and health in the intimate relationships of young adult New Zealanders</field><field name="creator">McKenzie, Donna Margaret</field><field name="description">Young people are often constructed in academic and lay explanations as an inherently risky population. They are the age group most likely to feature in public health statistics, especially those of intentional and unintentional injury. A common risk factor cited in these statistics is conflict within or breakdown of an inter-personal relationship, in particular intimate heterosexual relationships. Intimate relationships serve as markers of normal adulthood in New Zealand society, and many young people invest significantly in them for their emotional and material rewards. This study investigated the social processes and experiences that influence young adult New Zealanders' perceptions of their own and others' intimate relationships. It employed an inter-disciplinary framework of critical interpretive medical anthropology and a public health approach with a lifecourse perspective. A multi-interview method was used involving more than 90 people interviewed either in focus groups, as couples, or as individuals. Interviews focused on young people's ideas and experiences of healthy and unhealthy relationships, as well as the influence of families, friends, and popular culture on relationships.    Intimate relationships are based on naturalised gender differences that work to construct men as masculine/active and women as feminine/passive and hide disparities based on gender within a discourse of equality. The ideal healthy relationship is based on ideas of individualism, emotional and material inter-dependence, and the addition of other social networks into a partner relationship. Families are primary sources of information about and models for relationships. Friends are significant in establishing an adult identity separate to one's parents. Both families and friends are emotional safety nets in times of relationship difficulties. Understandings of popular culture and its products are most commonly experienced through gendered romantic narratives. Because of their ubiquity and popularity, information produced by mass media is particularly influential for young people.    Overall, young people reported that relationships are a considerable source of joy to them. However, when problems occur, they tend to revert to stereotypical and gendered cultural scripts rather than relying on individual knowledge. To mitigate the possible negative effects of these scripts, knowledge of the skills required to overcome relationships difficulties need to be made explicit and fostered by relevant public health and education policy and promotion activities.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ANTHROPOLOGY, CULTURAL (0326)</field><field name="subject">HEALTH SCIENCES, PUBLIC HEALTH (0573)</field><field name="subject">SOCIOLOGY, INDIVIDUAL AND FAMILY STUDIES (0628)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/24</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effects of different task types on L2 learners' intake and acquisition of two grammatical structures</field><field name="creator">Reinders, Hayo</field><field name="description">Recent years have seen a growing interest in the role of tasks in second language acquisition. A substantial body of research now exists investigating the effects of different task types and their accompanying instructions on learning. Less is known about how tasks affect intake and the relationship between intake and acquisition. This study investigated the effects of 1) implicit and explicit inductive instructions and 2) various task types on both intake and acquisition of two English grammatical structures. Fifty adult ESL learners enrolled in private language schools in New Zealand were pretested with the help of a timed and an untimed grammaticality judgement test for prior knowledge of negative adverbs and adverb placement and were randomly assigned to either a dictation, an individual reconstruction, or a collaborative reconstruction treatment. Treatments were accompanied by either implicit instructions (containing only practical instructions on how to perform the task) or explicit instructions (drawing participants' attention to the target structures and giving an example of them). Performance on the treatments was taken as a measure of intake, and talk-aloud reports were obtained to gauge participants' awareness during task completion. Gain scores from pretest to posttest and to delayed posttest were taken as an indication of learning effects. The results show that the explicit instructions of the inductive type used in this study were unable to affect participants' intake and acquisition in comparison with the implicit instructions. Also, the three types of treatments did not have an effect on acquisition in many cases. Where there was an effect, the treatments differentially affected intake and acquisition. Dictation led to high intake, but less acquisition, and the individual reconstruction treatment led to low intake, but greater acquisition. The collaborative reconstruction treatment was the most consistent of the three. The cognitively more demanding reconstruction treatments (i.e. those involving the retention of larger amounts of texts over longer periods of time) resulted in greater acquisition than the dictation treatment. The main theoretical implications of the results are that the type of inductive and low-level explicit instructions used in this study were not sufficient to differentially affect intake and acquisition. Other, more explicit types of treatments may be necessary. The results also indicate that task types that are relatively easy, affect intake to a greater extent than more demanding tasks, but that more demanding tasks are more likely to affect acquisition. On a methodological level, the concept of intake was found to be very difficult to operationalise, and it is suggested that additional measures be developed. Finally, the implications for teaching practice are that for relatively complex structures such as negative adverbs and adverb placement exposure to the input with minimal pedagogic intervention may not be sufficient. Teachers may also want to consider the effects of different task types on both intake and acquisition and both teachers and researchers need to be careful in drawing conclusionson the basis of immediate task performance.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Language, Linguistics (0290)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/25</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The function, design and distribution of New Zealand adzes</field><field name="creator">Turner, Marianne</field><field name="description">The main objective of this thesis was to understand the function, design and distribution of New Zealand adzes, aspects little studied in Polynesia as a whole. Methodology involved functional and manufacturing replication experiments and comparisons of these results with statistics derived from the analysis of almost 12,000 archaeological adzes. Methodology was guided by technological organization theory which states that technological strategies reflect human behaviours and that artefacts like adzes are physical manifestations of the strategies employed by people to overcome problems posed by environmental and resource conditions. Variability in adze morphology was discovered to be the outcome of ongoing technological adjustments to a range of conditions that were constrained by a set of functionally defined parameters. The nature of the raw material, both for the adzes themselves and to make them, had a major influence on adze technology and morphology within these functional parameters. Four basic functional adze types were identified fi-om distinct and consistent combinations of design attributes not previously recognized explicitly in previous adze typologies. It was found that design attributes previously considered significant like crosssection shape and butt reduction were more heavily influenced by raw material quality than functional specifications. It was also important to recognize that form and function changed over time with use, and because adzes were so valuable due to manufacturing costs, they were intensively curated. The majority of archaeological specimens studied for this thesis had seen major morphological and functional change. This dynamic was included ,in a typology based on 'adze state7 as findings suggested (1) that extending adze use-life and optimizing reworking potential was incorporated in initial design strategies, (2) that intensive curation may have played a major role in changes in adze morphology over time, and (3). that it had a major influence on distribution and discard patterns in the archaeological record. Having identified these influences on adze discard and distribution, two complex production and distribution networks were observed for the North Island based around Tahanga basalt and Nelson~Marlborough argillite. Each was complimentary to the other and involved other major and minor products and materials. Influential factors in the roles different settlements played in distribution included where people and raw materials were in relation to one another and the mode of transportation. The coastal location of early period settlements and important stone sources was an important aspect of these networks.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Anthropology, Archaeology (0324)</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420300 Cultural Studies::420305 New Zealand cultural studies</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420300 Cultural Studies::420306 Maori cultural studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/26</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The vegetation pattern of Rangitoto</field><field name="creator">Julian, Andrea</field><field name="description">The vegetation of the island of Rangitoto was examined in order to determine the current vegetation pattern and to identify the factors which have influenced the development of this pattern. Information about the order and dates of eruptive events was reviewed to gauge the length of time that the various surfaces of the island have been available as a substrate for the development of a vegetation covering. Available geological information, dating evidence, historical accounts, tree ages, and Maori evidence all point to a single period of eruptive activity, probably only several years in duration, around the mid- to late-1300's (A.D.). The order of eruption was probably production of the ash that covers neighbouring islands, followed by cinder cone building, followed by eruption of the lava flows. The lava flows were found to consist of clinkery aa flows, blocky aa flows, and a flow type referred to as Rangitoto slab flows. These flow types could be partially distinguished from one another, using discriminant analysis, on the basis of the length of the longest fragment on a 5x5m plot and the number of fragments on a lxlm subplot. A new transition sequence of flow types from pahoehoe to aa lavas is proposed for viscous lavas undergoing low rates of shear strain. The vegetation pattern of the lava fields was examine using TWINSPAN and CANOCO analysis of foliage cover percentage information gathered from 125 5x5m plots. It was found to consist of a successional sequence of vegetation arranged in a mosaic. The mosaic was found to relate strictly to the underlying lava flow surface. Large Metrosideros grow in crevices on slab flows and next to large boulders on aa flows. Smaller Metrosideros grow on small slabs on slab flows. Mixed species scrub is found growing on unbroken slab surfaces. The relative rate of colonisation of different types of flows under different climatic conditions was considered. The Metrosideros hybrid swarm was studied using morphometric information. The putative parent species of the swarm were found, using Principal Components Analysis, to be Metrosideros excelsa and Metrosideros robusta. The Rangitoto Metrosideros population was found, using Canonical Variates Analysis, to be the result of hybridisation, followed by introgression towards M. excelsa . The probable F1 hybrids grow in early successional stage vegetation. The major geographical trend is the tendency for backcrossed hybrids to grow on the eastern side of the island, suggesting eastern origins of M. robusta seeds. The impact of browsing animals on the vegetation was studied over five years in exclosures and corresponding control sites. Metrosideros foliage recovered slightly. Griselinia lucida and Cyathodes juniperina seedlings were recruited into the shrub layers in exclosures, but not in control sites. Astelia seedlings also benefitted from the absence of browsing pressure, as did Thelymitra longifolia. The distribution of browsing animal populations in relation to the vegetation pattern was studied using faecal pellet recruitment data gathered by the New Zealand Forest Service in 1984. Both wallabies (Petrogale penicillata penicillata) and possums (Trichosurus vulpecula) were found to be distributed principally according to the amount of palatable foliage available to each species in each vegetation type.</field><field name="date">1992</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Botany</field><field name="subject">BIOSC104: New Zealand Ecology and Conservation</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270400 Botany::270401 Plant systematics, taxonomy and phylogeny</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/27</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Expecting the best : instructional practices, teacher beliefs and student outcomes</field><field name="creator">Rubie, Christine Margaret</field><field name="description">The current study explored whether there are more pervasive teacher-centred expectations than the typical studies that find specific teacher-student expectation effects. Groups of teachers who had uniformly high or low expectations for their students were identified, and their instructional practices, beliefs and effects on the academic and social outcomes for their students were explored in four studies. Study One explored the academic outcomes for students in the high and low expectation teachers' classrooms over a year. Students in the classes of teachers with uniformly high expectations for their students made significantly greater progress in reading than their counterparts in the classes of teachers who had low expectations for their students. Study Two involved observations of the instructional and interactional practices of the different groups of teachers. Those with high expectations for all their students spent more time instructing their students, more frequently provided their students with a framework for their learning, questioned their students more and provided them with more feedback on their learning than the teachers who had uniformly low expectations. It also appeared from the observational data that the teachers who had uniformly high expectations for their students' learning provided a more positive socioemotional climate in which instruction took place. In Study Three the different groups of teachers were interviewed regarding their beliefs about how learning should be provided to students with high or low ability. It was found that the high expectation teachers believed there should be less differentiation in the learning opportunities provided to their low and high ability students than did the low expectation teachers. The former group of teachers also reported providing their students with more choice in their learning than did the latter group of teachers. Study Four focused on the academic and social self-perceptions of the students. The academic self-perceptions of the students who were in the classes with teachers who had high iii expectations for their learning increased across the school year while those in classrooms with teachers who had low expectations for their learning decreased. A model is built whereby it is suggested that teachers' expectations for their classes can have major effects on opportunities to learn, instructional practices, interactional patterns, student self-perceptions and academic outcomes.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Education, Educational Psychology (0525)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/28</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Examining 'globalisation' and 'convergence': A comparative study of university systems in Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan and Thailand, 1946--1996 (China)</field><field name="creator">Li, Lucinda Kit Ching</field><field name="description">Globalisation has been a subject of intense debate and continual investigation in academic circles for almost 20 years. However, the opinions on what it is and what impact it makes on national systems are still as diverse and divided as ever. This research is an endeavour to contribute further to the understanding of the processes and outcomes of globalisation by undertaking a cross-national historical study of four university systems and four elite universities over an extended period of time. By comparing and juxtaposing the changes in university objectives, provision, funding and regulation between 1946 and 1996, it seeks to establish whether globalisation has reduced national variations and led to convergence in university policies and practices.    This research is structured in three parts. Part I incorporates three chapters: one on the analysis of globalisation and its driving forces; one on the concept of convergence and its manifestations in higher education; and one on the methodology of research. These three chapters together advance an understanding of the mechanisms constituting the convergence hypothesis and its investigation. Part II is comprised of four case studies which provide empirical evidence on the impact of globalisation and the investigation of the hypothesis. Part III provides an integrated analysis of the outcomes as well as a final appraisal of the study itself.    Findings show that global forces do have a strong homogenising tendency causing a high level of convergence across cultures and nations. But convergence is not an inevitable outcome of globalisation. A complicated picture of convergence and divergence is found. It is shown to be possible to have convergence in one aspect of the same policy and divergence in another, as in the examples of female participation and medium of instruction. It is also possible to have convergence among some countries but not others, as in the case of university regulation. The actual result depends on, one, the aspect of policy selected for study; and, two, the dynamic interactions of the following factors: the driving impetus of economic globalisation, the powerful influence of hegemonic states and mighty economic and trade supranational organisations, and the willingness and ability of the nation-states to make the changes. That is to say, the impact of global forces is context-bound. The evidence of both convergence and divergence present at the same time vindicates the complexity and contingent nature of the globalisation process. A more accurate assessment of global effects requires a proper conceptualisation of convergence, the necessary investigation of the global-national-institutional interfaces, and longitudinal comparative studies of different cultures and nations, as illustrated by this study.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Business Administration, Marketing (0338)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/29</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Creating New Zealanders:  Education and the formation of the state and the building of the nation</field><field name="creator">Stephenson, Maxine Sylvia</field><field name="description">Educational activity preceded official British presence in New Zealand. The development of the New Zealand state from crown colony, to a system of relatively autonomous provincial councils, to a centralized administration took place within a period of four decades. Co-terminous with and essential to the state's progressive securing of its authority was the institutionalization of separate national systems of education for Maori and Pakeha.    Whilst the ascendancy of the state and the securing of education as a central state concern proceeded ultimately with the sanction of the state and in accordance with its objectives it was not a straight forward process in a young nation which was born democratic, but was struggling to consolidate political and cultural unity. The various stages and the ultimate form that education in New Zealand took were closely linked to shifts in the nature and role of the state in its formative years, in the nature of its relationship with civil society, and in its official relationship with Maori. This provided the context and dynamic of the shift to state control as public schooling came to dominate over private or voluntary efforts, and as the particularism of isolated provincial settlements was replaced by a system designed to serve the nation as a whole.    Positing conceptual links between the development of national education and the processes of state formation and nation building in a colonizing context, this thesis argues that the institutionally differentiated form that universal education took in New Zealand produced a site through which socially, culturally and ideologically determined conceptions of &#8220;normality&#8221; would be legitimated and become hegemonic. By nationalizing education to legitimate a culture of uniformity based on a specific set of norms, individual New Zealanders were differentially created according to class, gender and ethnicity, and to physical, intellectual, behavioural and sensory functioning.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">EDUCATION, HISTORY OF (0520)</field><field name="subject">EDUCATION, SOCIOLOGY OF (0340)</field><field name="subject">HISTORY, ASIA, AUSTRALIA AND OCEANIA (0332)</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education::330100 Education Studies</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420300 Cultural Studies::420306 Maori cultural studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/30</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An assessment of EEG biofeedback for the remediation of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder</field><field name="creator">Heywood, Charles Edward</field><field name="description">Seven boys between the ages of 7 and 12 with Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), some also with Specific Learning Disabilities (LD) and/or elevated aggression scales on the Child Behaviour Checklist (CBCL), were involved in this study of the effectiveness of EEG Biofeedback for the remediation of ADHD. A multiple-baseline design with an embedded ABAB component was used to compare baseline, 12-15 Hz Sensorimotor Rhythm (SMR) EEG Biofeedback (&#8220;active&#8221;) and single-blind sham feedback (&#8220;placebo&#8221;) conditions. Seven dependent variables including the ADHD Rating Scale, Child Attention Profile, Children's Checking Task, Controlled Oral Word Fluency Test, paired associate learning and continuous performance tasks were combined as z-scores into a single composite repeated measure. Visual and multiple baseline analyses were inconclusive. The primary analysis was by randomisation test with statistical control for overall trend. Randomisation test results were combined across five subjects (two subjects having failed to complete the study) using techniques for combining independent probabilities; for the combined group the placebo vs. active contrast was significant (p &lt; 0.02) with the active conditions displaying the more improved scores. An examination of effect sizes by subject and condition showed that the placebo vs. active contrast was significant (p &lt; 0.05, based on the confidence intervals for effect estimates) with a large effect size if trend was ignored and the two &#8220;drop-outs&#8221; were excluded but non-significant with a small effect size if overall trend was controlled, and the two drop-outs included. Effect sizes calculated pre-post were medium on average, and Reliable Change Indices for CBCL parent rated attention were significant for five subjects (p &lt; 0.001). There was no improvement in academic performance as assessed by pre-post Wide Range Achievement Test-Revised. There was no significant effect of condition on EEG Theta/SMR ratio, although there were some significant correlations with individual dependent variables. Four of six children continued to improve on the composite score from the end of the study to six-month follow-up. Results were discussed in light of non-specific treatment effects such as tacit behavioural training, Fried's respiration hypothesis, the cognitive energetic model of attention and confounds due to trend and subject mortality. It was concluded that EEG biofeedback appears to have beneficial effects on ADHD symptoms but these are due largely to non-specific treatment factors and confounds such as regression to the mean.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">PSYCHOLOGY, PHYSIOLOGICAL (0989)</field><field name="subject">PSYCHOLOGY, CLINICAL (0622)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/33</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Parent-child relationships, peer functioning, and preschool hyperactivity</field><field name="creator">Keown, Louise June</field><field name="description">The aim of this thesis was to examine the parent-child relationships and peer functioning of community-identified, 4-year-old boys with hyperactive behaviour problems. The sample consisted of 33 pervasively hyperactive boys and 34 control children. Parenting and child behaviours, and family life factors were assessed at home using a range of measures including the Parental Account of Children's Symptoms Interview (PACS), the Parenting Scale, the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ), and the Life Events Questionnaire. In addition, maternal directiveness and synchrony were coded from videotaped parent-child interaction during free play. Children's peer relations were assessed with teacher ratings on the Child Behavior Scale (CBS) and observer ratings of peer interactions at kindergarten.    Results showed that parents of hyperactive boys used less effective parenting skills in disciplinary situations and in coping with child behaviour problems, and spent less time in positive parent-child interaction than comparison group parents. Mothers of hyperactive boys also engaged in fewer synchronous play interactions with their sons and gave more negative ratings on indices of life stress. Poor parent coping, father-child communication, maternal synchrony, negative disciplinary practices, and life stress were significantly associated with hyperactivity after adjusting for the effects of conduct problems. The best parenting predictor of hyperactivity was maternal coping.    Compared with control children, the hyperactive boys received significantly higher ratings on exclusion by peers, aggressive, noncompliant, and non-social behaviours, as well as significantly lower ratings of prosocial behaviour and peer acceptance. These between-group differences in social functioning remained significant after statistical control for the effects of conduct problems. Further analysis suggested that the associations between hyperactivity and child social behaviours were partly or wholly explained by group differences in exposure to parenting behaviours that are important for children's social development.    These findings highlight the need to examine more closely the role of parenting behaviours in shaping the course, prognosis and treatment outcomes in relation to the behavioural and social adjustment of preschool hyperactive children. The implications of these findings for early childhood intervention in hyperactive behaviour problems are discussed.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">PSYCHOLOGY, DEVELOPMENTAL (0620)</field><field name="subject">PSYCHOLOGY, CLINICAL (0622)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/34</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Phenotypic characterisation of the tremor mutant and AAV mediated aspartoacylase gene transfer in the rat model of Canavan disease</field><field name="creator">McPhee, Scott William John</field><field name="description">The doctoral studies described in this thesis involve the phenotypic characterization of the tremor rat, an animal model of Canavan disease, and a proof of principle gene transfer study in this model. The phenotype of the tremor rat is examined at the genetic, molecular, cellular, neurochemical, physical and behavioural levels, and tremor mutants are described within the context of Canavan disease. Tremor mutants appear to share many phenotypes with both human patients and to the knock-out mouse model. The deletion of aspartoacylase results in a total loss of the capacity to metabolize N-acetyl-aspartate to acetate and aspartate in brain, leading to elevations in brain N-acetyl-aspartate levels, changes in cell and tissue morphology, and physical and behavioural deficits including mild akinesia and loss of normal motor coordination and balance. Parallel to this work was the development of a gene transfer approach to treat Canavan disease, involving Adeno-associated virus mediated delivery of aspartoacylase to the mammalian central nervous system. Gene transfer was undertaken in tremor rat mutants, and analysis was made of gene expression and function as well as the effect of aspartoacylase expression on improving the phenotypic deficits observed in mutant animals. Gene expression was observed at the RNA and protein level, with recombinant protein observed in cell soma and processes. Although not significant the data suggested a trend of decreased NAA levels after aspartoacylase transfer in comparison to animals injected with a vector encoding green fluorescent protein. Improvement was noted in the rotorod phenotype with mutant animals receiving aspartoacylase gene transfer performing better at tests of balance and coordinated locomotion than animals receiving a control vector. The study provided evidence that Adeno-associated virus mediated aspartoacylase gene transfer to the brain improves some of the deficits in tremor mutants, and supports the rationale of human gene transfer for Canavan disease.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">BIOLOGY, NEUROSCIENCE (0317)</field><field name="subject">BIOLOGY, MOLECULAR (0307)</field><field name="subject">BIOLOGY, GENETICS (0369)</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270700 Ecology and Evolution::270702 Marine and estuarine ecology (incl. marine ichthyology)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/35</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Criticizing and responding to criticism in a foreign language: A study of Vietnamese learners of English</field><field name="creator">Nguyen, Minh Thi Thuy</field><field name="description">Interlanguage pragmatics research has contributed a great deal to our understanding of L2 pragmatic use but less to our understanding of L2 pragmatic development, although developmental issues are also its primary research goal. Additionally, previous studies have been confined to a rather small set of speech acts, under-researching such face-damaging acts as criticizing and responding to criticism even though these may be more challenging for L2 learners.    The present study examines pragmatic development in the use of criticizing and responding to criticism by a group of Vietnamese EFL learners with a view to shedding light on the pragmatic properties of these speech acts. IL data were collected from 12 high beginners, 12 intermediate learners, and 12 advanced learners, via a written questionnaire and role play, and analyzed with reference to L1 and L2 baseline data collected from 12 Vietnamese and 12 Australian NSs via the same methods. Metapragmatic data were collected via retrospective interview.    Four main findings are discussed. Firstly, the learners criticized and responded to criticism very differently from the NSs. This difference might have adversely affected how the learners negotiated their intentions expressed via speech act realizations. Secondly, there was little evidence of any proficiency effect on the learners' use of these two speech acts. This was probably because pragmatic development was limited by the EFL context, as the learners had had insufficient exposure to the target norms. Thirdly, there was evidence of pragmatic transfer in the learners' production. This transfer was affected by the learners' perception of L1-L2 proximity and assumption of L2 reasonableness. Finally, the retrospective interviews with learners suggested four main sources of influence on their pragmatic decision-making: insufficient L2 pragmatic knowledge, transfer of communication and learning, processing difficulty, and learning experience.    The present study lends support to a number of SLA theories, including Bialystoks' processing model and Meisel et al.'s complexification hypothesis. It found that the major challenge for learners in L2 pragmatic acquisition is to gain control over processing. It also found an acquisitional order of modality markers which was dependent upon their structural complexity and the processing demands involved in producing them.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">LANGUAGE, LINGUISTICS (0290)</field><field name="subject">EDUCATION, LANGUAGE AND LITERATURE (0279)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/36</field></doc><doc><field name="title">When worlds collide: ICTs, English teachers and high-stakes assessment (New Zealand)</field><field name="creator">Coogan, Phil</field><field name="description">The aim of this thesis is to ascertain the degree to which high-stakes assessment for qualifications, such as New Zealand's National Certificate of Educational Achievement (NCEA), act as a barrier to secondary English teachers' use of information and communication technologies (ICTs) with their students. Although the focus is on high-stakes assessment for qualifications, other factors, which might also facilitate or hinder English teachers' use of ICTs, such as professional development and infrastructural, technical and access issues, are also considered.    The literature review summarises the factors which tend to constrain or encourage teachers' use of ICTs, with a special focus on the considerable constraint placed on secondary teachers by their role in preparing and assessing students for high-stakes qualifications. The literature review also highlights the lack of convincing research into the impact on learning of ICTs but reveals that, in the subject English, there is some evidence of a positive impact when appropriate ICTs are used by well trained teachers in appropriate contexts.    Key NCEA foundation and implementation documents and publicity, achievement standards and assessment activities were analysed to ascertain the degree of official endorsement for the use of ICTs in secondary schools and English programmes in particular. To gauge the perceptions of New Zealand English teachers about the constraints and encouragers of ICTs in their teaching, all NCEA level one English teachers were surveyed. This was followed by face-to-face and online focus groups in which trends revealed in the survey were explored.    Document analysis revealed considerable official optimism that the flexibility and internal assessment of the NCEA would enable teachers to make greater use of ICTs. The achievement standards and supporting assessment activities however, tend to situate ICTs at the margins of English programmes as optional extras which, if used at all, tend to support current practice. The focus groups confirmed survey findings that, although English teachers are significant users of ICTs in their personal and professional lives, although they believe in the educational advantages of ICTs and although they work in schools and departments which support the classroom use of ICTs, they face significant constraints which prevent them making as much use of ICTs as they would like in their teaching. Most significant among these constraints is pressure of course coverage and lack of class time (largely attributable to the need to prepare students for high-stakes assessments). Other constraints include lack of adequate access to ICTs and technical support, and lack of appropriate professional development and time to learn about ICTs.    Based on the literature review and research findings, recommendations are provided for schools, policy makers and researchers. Key among these is the need to acknowledge the profound influence of high-stakes qualifications on secondary schools and teachers and evolve such qualifications to encourage and enable desired innovations. It is recommended that ICTs could be infused into English and eventually, inter-disciplinary programmes, through the creation of innovative, ICT infused achievement standards which could be combined into flexibly structured courses which better meet the needs of twenty first century students. Also recommended are approaches which enable greater access to ICTs for English teachers and methods of professional development which have proved effective with adult learners.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">EDUCATION, TECHNOLOGY (0710)</field><field name="subject">EDUCATION, LANGUAGE AND LITERATURE (0279)</field><field name="subject">EDUCATION, TESTS AND MEASUREMENTS (0288)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/37</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Computing exact approximations of a Chaitin omega number</field><field name="creator">Shu, Chi-Kou</field><field name="description">A Chaitin Omega number, &#937;, is the halting probability of a universal Chaitin (self-delimiting Turing) machine. Every &#937; number is both  computably enumerable and random. In particular, every &#937; number is non-computable. In this thesis, we describe a method to compute the exact values of the first 64 successive bits of a natural  Chaitin Omega number.    We first describe a model of computation which has been defined and proved to be a universal Chaitin machine U. We then propose a method (procedure) which combines iterative executions of an algorithm with mathematical analysis to get the exact values of the first successive 64 bits of the corresponding Chaitin &#937;U number of U.    This particular defined Chaitin machine U is essentially a register machine and has been implemented in Java. We call it the canonical compressed model (or compressed model) as it allows only &#8216;canonical&#8217; program strings to be processed in U. Thus, many input strings which are illegal, hence useless, are ignored and never involved in the computational process. In addition, the compressed design shortens the length of all instructions so that relatively short strings now contain somewhat complex programs.    A simulator for U, written in Java, is a primary part of the project. The algorithm is executed iteratively, computing step by step an increasing sequence of rational numbers (in binary) to approximate &#937; U. In the n-th step, the algorithm produces four main output files: all halting strings, looping strings, run-time errors, and prefix strings (incomplete programs). In each step, all prefix strings (of the previous step) are read and processed one by one. Each string is extended by 7 bits (ASCII code representations for symbols) to generate new strings that are examined one by one to detect any lexical, syntactic, semantic, or run-time error in each of them. Any of those strings with an error detected is discarded to save storage space and execution time.    We solve the Halting Problem for all programs for U of length less than or equal to 84 bits so we can calculate an increasing sequence of exact approximations converging to &#937;U. By means of a mathematical analysis the first successive 64 bits, 0000001000000100000110001000011010001111110010111011101000010000 of the 84 bits are proved to be the exact first bits of &#937;U. Actually, more bits can be obtained by this procedure if the disk space is sufficient for it to go on, but this procedure cannot be extended indefinitely.    In order to assure that our computing result is correct, we have proved that all input strings of length less than or equal to 84 executed in  U over 100 steps are not halting programs.*   *This dissertation is a compound document (contains both a paper copy and a CD as part of the dissertation).

Erosion-corrosion is a generalised wear phenomenon where the combined effect of each degradation mechanism generates more extensive mass loss than the sum of each mechanism acting independently. Previous research has highlighted several theoretical mechanisms under this generalized process, ranging from the erosion induced breakdown of oxide scales in corrosive environments, through to the development of oxide layers in highly erosive environments. Prior to this current work experimental simulation of these mechanisms has focused on bulk alloy materials with well characterised oxidation responses, under conditions of low temperature, low erodent impact velocity and high erodent flux, conditions which are readily generated within laboratory scale rigs and which tend towards the low impact energy conditions encountered within fluidised bed combustors. Few works have addressed erosion-corrosion under simulated turbine conditions of high temperature, high erodent impact velocity and low erodent flux. While comparative trials have been run under such conditions on a purely mass loss basis, little has been presented regarding the microstructural analysis of such degradation, particularly for materials that rely on the industrially relevant, slow growing oxide scales Cr2O3 and Al2O3.  Thermally sprayed Cr3C2-NiCr coatings are routinely applied to combat wear at high temperature due to the high wear resistance imparted by the hard carbide particles and the high temperature oxidation resistant nature of the Cr2O3 oxide formed over both phases. However, most published work characterising the erosion-corrosion response of these coatings has been conducted on a comparative basis by contrasting coatings of various composition ratios, deposited by various techniques, with the response of well characterised bulk materials. Little has been presented on the microstructural mechanism of erosioncorrosion of Cr3C2-NiCr coatings, a point highlighted by the limited understanding of the oxidation mechanism of the Cr3C2 phase, the oxidation mechanisms of the combined composite Cr3C2-NiCr and the influence of the coating splat structure on the oxidation response. While the erosion response of thermal spray coatings and bulk cermets is more widely understood, most works have been conducted under milder conditions than used in the current work. In addition previous works have been conducted primarily on assprayed coatings with few works taking into account the effect of heat treatment induced changes in the coating composition and microstructure that occur with extended in-service exposure at elevated temperature.  In addressing the short comings in the current state of knowledge, the aim of this work was to characterise the mechanism of erosion-corrosion of high velocity sprayed Cr3C2-NiCr thermal spray coatings under turbine conditions, incorporating the effect of variation in the composition and carbide distribution with inflight degradation, variations in starting powder morphology, heat treatment, erosion conditions and exposure temperature.  75 Cr3C2-25(Ni20Cr) coatings were deposited by Aerospray HVAF, GMA Microjet HVOF, Stellite Jet Kote HVOF and TAFA JP-5000 HVOF spraying under optimised conditions using agglomerated/sintered and blended powders. The prealloyed powder based coatings, characterised in terms of microhardness, porosity content and phase degradation, were found to exceed the average values of coating quality presented in the literature. The blended powder based coating of this work was comparable with the coating attributes presented in the literature for plasma and HVOF coatings based on this powder morphology. Based on these results the coatings were considered representative of those sprayed industrially and therefore the responses of the samples in this work to oxidation and erosion were considered indicative of the response of industrially applied coatings of this composition in service.  Heat treatment trials were conducted on the Aerospray HVAF and Microjet HVOF coatings at 900&#186;C in air and argon for up to 60 days to simulate the compositional and microstructural development of these coatings under elevated temperature conditions in service. In the prealloyed powder based coatings, rapid carbide precipitation occurred within the first two days in both coatings to reach the steady state composition of 75-80vol%. Minimal in-flight carbide dissolution in the HVAF coating led to preferential carbide precipitation on the retained carbide grains. In the Microjet HVOF coatings, which suffered extensive inflight carbide dissolution, carbide precipitation occurred as fine precipitates in the carbide-free zones, forming large sponge-like agglomerates. With extended exposure Ostwald ripening led to coarsening of the individual carbide grain size and widespread agglomeration of the carbide grains into an extensive three dimensional network after 30 days exposure, with minimal development out to 60 days. Compositionally, heat treatment led to a dramatic reduction in the supersaturated matrix phase Cr content, with the steady state Cr composition of the Microjet HVOF coating exceeding that of the Aerospray HVAF coating based on XRD analysis. Cr3C2 was the only carbide detected with heat treatment. Heat treatment of the blended powder based coating led to sintering of the single phase splats. Diffusion of the carbide elements into the matrix phase splats occurred, allowing fingers and nodules of the carbide to develop into this phase as well as increasing the matrix phase Cr concentration.  Oxidation of Cr3C2 by hot stage XRD analysis at 600&#186;C, combined with TGA analysis at 600-850&#186;C, supported the mechanism of stepwise decarburisation prior to Cr2O3 formation, presented as one possible mechanism in the literature. Oxidation of the Cr3C2-NiCr coatings over the range 700-850&#186;C was dependent on the starting powder morphology and the extent of dissolved carbide in the matrix phase. Oxidation of the as-sprayed prealloyed powder based coatings was dictated by the matrix phase, the high Cr concentration resulting from carbide dissolution leading to rapid growth of the Cr2O3 phase over the oxidising carbide grains. Growth stresses induced by such overgrowth lead to the formation of interfacial voids over the carbide grains at high temperature. Heat treatment reduced the matrix phase Cr concentration, resulting in the coating phases oxidising independently with a reduced magnitude of lateral matrix based scale growth over the carbide phase. In the blended powder based coating, bulbous Ni oxides dominated the scale topography. With extended exposure a continuous Cr2O3 scale formed below the faster growing Ni oxides, which enabled lateral growth of the scale over the carbide based Cr2O3 scales. Following heat treatment the matrix phase Cr concentration increased, minimising the development of Ni oxides on this phase.  Erosion studies were carried out in a custom built high temperature erosion apparatus. Ambient temperature trials were conducted using Al2O3 erodent at velocities of 150m/s. The as-sprayed prealloyed powder based coatings exhibited a brittle impact response, which was accentuated in the Microjet HVOF coating by the increased extent of in-flight carbide dissolution and the splat structure which made this sample more susceptible to brittle erosion mechanisms. Heat treatment of these coatings led to sintering of the splats and a more ductile impact response due to the increased ductility of the matrix phase. The as-sprayed blended powder based coatings exhibited a range of impact responses from brittle erosion of the carbide through to ductile erosion of the matrix based splats. Mass loss was accentuated by the poor intersplat adhesive strength. Heat treatment led to sintering of the splats, resulting in a more microstructural based erosion response.  The two prealloyed powder based coatings generated similar erosion rates under the aggressive conditions, distinctly more erosion resistant than the blended powder based coatings. Heat treatment improved the erosion resistance of all the coatings, however, the duration of heat treatment had a negligible effect on the magnitude of erosive mass loss.  Erosion at 800&#186;C, with an impact velocity of 235m/s, lead to significantly deeper erodent penetration into the coating than noted at ambient temperature. The significant increase in the matrix phase ductility at elevated temperature minimized the impact of carbide dissolution on the matrix impact response in the prealloyed powder based coatings. The primary effect of carbide dissolution was to reduce the carbide concentration, allowing deformation of the matrix to dictate the coating response. Carbide development with heat treatment significantly reduced the ability of the matrix to deform in this manner. The increased matrix phase ductility in the blended powder based coating reduced the concentration of impact energy on the splat boundaries, leading to a more microstructural based erosion response. Heat treatment had a negligible effect on the coating response, given the reduced significance of the splat boundary adhesion.  Erosion at 700&#186;C generated similar erosion responses in the prealloyed powder based coatings to those noted at 800&#186;C, the lower matrix phase ductility reflected in the more brittle response evident as brittle cracking and fracture. The effect of carbide development with heat treatment was not as dramatic as at 800&#186;C due to the reduced matrix phase ductility at this temperature. Erosion of the blended powder based coating at 700&#186;C generated the same spectrum of erosion response as noted at 800&#186;C in both the as-sprayed and heat treated states, with the variation in matrix phase ductility with temperature overshadowed by the heterogeneous coating impact response resulting from the heterogeneous phase distribution.  The steady state erosion rate at 700&#186;C was comparable across all of the coatings in both the as-sprayed and heat treated conditions. At 800&#186;C, heat treatment had a negative impact on the prealloyed powder based coatings, but no definitive effect on the blended powder based coatings. The Microjet HVOF coatings were more erosion resistant than the Aerospray HVAF coatings under these conditions. These results pointed to a reduction in the significance of the coating splat structure on the magnitude of erosion, in favour of a more microstructural based response at high temperature.  In both the ambient and elevated temperature trials the coating microhardness values proved to be a poor indicator in predicting the magnitude or relative ranking of the erosion response of the different coatings under these aggressive erosion conditions.  Erosion-corrosion under turbine conditions of high temperature, high erodent velocity and low erodent flux, was simulated by oxidizing samples at 900&#186;C and subjecting them to one second of erosion every 48 hours over a period of 60 days. The degradation testing was assessed in accelerated testing in additional trials by polishing the oxide scale formed at 900&#186;C from the sample surface every 48 hours over the same time period. Under these conditions the coatings formed thick oxide scales that penetrated into the coating. Preferential internal oxidation of the Cr3C2 phase occurred in the coating, consuming the grains in the near surface zone through the formation of Cr2O3 to a depth dependent upon the test temperature. Oxygen ingress occurred along the carbide-matrix interface and was accentuated in the regions of impact damage surrounding the erodent indentations. Internal oxidation of the carbide phase sealed off the pockets of matrix phase which were eventually consumed by oxidation once they were no longer able to maintain a protective Cr2O3 oxide. The extent of internal attack was consistent in the 20, 40 and 60 day samples, suggesting that the internal oxidation front proceeded at a constant rate in front of the erosion front into the coating. The prealloyed powder based coatings were more resistant to such internal degradation relative to the blended powder based coatings, with an internally oxidised zone of 6&#236;m relative to the 10&#236;m thick internally oxidized band in the blended powder based coating. While each erodent impact event may be classified as oxidation affected erosion, the low erodent flux effectively led to a long-term response more accurately described as erosion affected oxidation.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Engineering, General (0537)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/39</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Technological law :  societal control of technology and the potential of the world standards movement</field><field name="creator">Hitchcock, Edward</field><field name="description">Over the last three centuries the rapidly increasing influence of technology has come to dominate every aspect of human life. Progressive realization of adverse effects has led to increasing demand for and imposition of control measures. The concept of common law embodied in legal tradition have been found inadequate, and forced a change to "enacted law". The regulatory explosion necessitated delegation from legislative to executive agencies.The resulting techniques of control developed in the United Kingdom, New Zealand, Australia, Canada and the United States are examined. One common factor stands out, the extensive dependence of law-making bodies on independent technical specification material from non-government sources, and the confused, conflicting, and inconsistent methods of utilizing those specifications in law-making. Most of this independent material comes from Standards bodies. Their basic concept, the establishing of acceptable practice by prior agreement, is outlined, and the growth of the movement traced from the original development in Britain to a World-wide movement. Their processes of consultation and consensus represent a practical democratic system of self regulation. Studies of these aspects are rare, but a number of those relevant are reviewed, ranging from the Robens committee in Britain, through Building Code Reform in New Zealand, to a whole series of very recent reports from the United States, including a Presidential Task Force, an attempt to establish a National Standards Policy, a Federally commissioned study by a Professor of Law, and a Presidential Executive Order.From these emerge the pattern of complaint: Regulatory control is excessive, rigid, and liable to cause economic waste. It tends to be ineffective, and fails to achieve primary aims. As technology development exposes society to greater risks, efficiency becomes more vital, and failure to achieve control a serious danger. Problems arise from the failure of traditional legal approaches to adapt to the newer challenge of technology, particularly the legal acceptance of law "as it is" without recognition that the task calls for developing the law-making process to meet the needs of the changed situation. It is contended that many of the problems in regulatory control of technology come from the practice of making technical specification material direct legal command. The various reports reviewed comment on the limitations inherent in negative legislative control, the irrelevance of litigation, Court action and punishment, to the fundamental problem of achieving successful control. There is need for the encouragement of self regulation, and establishment of appropriate links with law.The special characteristics and responsibilities of law controlling technology are brought out, and call for identification as a separate branch of law: "Technological Law". Such law, it is contended, needs to make optimum usage of (a) the factors that have contributed to the dominance of technology, including the scientific approach, and the practice of prior agreement and (b) the essential components of democratic society, including participation, consensus, decentralized control, and self regulation associated with a formal method of determining acceptability.Practical proposals are developed involving the recognition of the practice of legislating by reference to independent technical specifications the encouragement of self-regulation processes through statutory backing, and their linking by recognition of the dyad in law, a separation of fundamental aims and principles appropriate to law from the means of meeting these aims.There is detailed examination of the three themes of reform. Techniques of the reference process, the legal objections, and the range of practices are examined, and acceptable technique suggested. The significance and importance of self-regulation is examined, and the contribution of "Standards" developed. A detailed examination is made of the various examples of two part law found in legislation, or in the studies reviewed. The framing of law in terms of general requirements is considered in relation to the problem of certainty and the idealization of the performance concept. The prerogative of the law-maker to designate certain practices as complying with general requirements is established as fundamental. The objection that this is a function of interpretation which lies exclusively with the Courts is discussed and the principle advanced that the vital Court function should never be called into the routine observance area.Technological law has as its essential aim the achievement of observance. Punishment, and court action is indication of failure. The emphasis must be on understanding and facilitating compliance. The second part of the dyad calls for sets of interrelated, interdependent specifications of acceptable practice, serving equally differing specialized laws, technical practices, commercial practices and education, and clarifying in positive fashion that which complies with law. The existing, established mechanisms of the world Standards movement are seen as providing the sets of technical specifications to fulfill this second function. This industry-developed process of self regulation utilises the techniques of prior agreement and in practical form, the elusive concept of consensus.Studies have emphasised the superior ability of the system to call in technical resources and voluntary effort to the service of law-making, in comparison with the resources of a governmental agency. The desirable aim is partnership, and the utilization of substantial measures of voluntary compliance.The question of recognition and authority for Standards and their producing organizations is seen as essential, and criteria are developed from the examples reviewed, notably from the pioneer New Zealand Act of 1941.The study emphasizes the little recognised function of Standards organizations of identifying acceptable practice, providing what has become an essential component of the machinery of government of a modern state.The mechanism provides a basis of certainty for commercial operations, and, through the strength of consumer or purchaser choice, an effective method of control as an alternative to yet more complex regulatory activity.</field><field name="date">1978</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Engineering, Mechanical (0548)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/40</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Spirit of Christ and the postmodern city: Transformative revival among Auckland's Evangelicals and Pentecostals (New Zealand)</field><field name="creator">Grigg, Vivian Lawrence</field><field name="description">This study develops a missional theology for both process and goals of 'Citywide Transformative Revival.' This has been grounded in the local realities of Auckland as a representative modern/postmodern city.    Global discussion among urban missions strategists and theologians have provoked the question: 'What is the relationship of the Spirit of Christ to the transformation of a postmodern city?' This has been examined in a limited manner, using two local indicators: the New Zealand revival (for the work of the Holy Spirit) and Auckland city (for emergent modern/postmodern megacities). This has resulted in an exploration of  revival theology and its limitations among Auckland's Pentecostals and Evangelicals and a proposal for a theology of transformative revival that engages the postmodern city.    To accomplish this, a research framework is proposed within an evangelical perspective, a postmodern hermeneutic of 'transformational conversations ', an interfacing of faith community conversations and urban conversations.    This is used to develop a new theory of 'citywide transformative revival' as an expansion of revival theories, a field within pneumatology. Citywide transformative revival is a concept of synergistic revivals in multiple sectors of a mega-city. This results in long-term change of urban vision and values towards the principles of the Kingdom of God.    A theology of transformative process is developed from apostolic and prophetic themes. These are outcomes of gifts released in revival. Transformative revival results in new transformative apostolic and prophetic structures that engage the postmodern city soul.    Transformation implies goals. The results of revival, the transformative visions for the city, are developed from themes of the City of God and the Kingdom of God. I expand largely 'spiritual' Western formulations of the Kingdom to a holistic Kingdom vision of the spiritual, communal and material aspects of the postmodern city. These enable conversation spaces with modern urbanism and postmodernism.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">THEOLOGY (0469)</field><field name="subject">SOCIOLOGY, PUBLIC AND SOCIAL WELFARE (0630)</field><field name="subject">RELIGION, GENERAL (0318)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/41</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Affective change in adult students in second chance mathematics courses : three different teaching approaches</field><field name="creator">Miller-Reilly, Barbara Joy</field><field name="description">A case study approach was used to explore second-chance mathematics through two larger courses and one individual study program. A different teaching approach, by committed experienced teachers, was used in each course. In evaluating their effectiveness, I focused on affective change in the students, relating this to their achievement. This study contributes to research on understanding good teaching of mathematics to adults. Qualitative and quantitative data were collected over several years. Methods included: a questionnaire (including mathematics attitude and belief scales as well as demographic and open questions); interviews with students to gather more affective data and explore their reactions to the course approach; and the individual supervised study course was audio-taped for six months. Teachers of the larger courses were also interviewed about their goals for, and experiences with, the students. These multiple strands of evidence provide a complex overall picture of three, largely successful, teaching approaches. Each measure had its own contribution to make, and taken together they illuminated the ways in which affective change was related to ackevement in the three contexts. The higher achieving groups in each of the two larger courses entered the courses with more positive attitudes and beliefs than the lower achieving groups and subsequent affective changes reinforced these differences. The lower achieving groups completed the courses affectively worse off than when they started, Students' reactions to these approaches were compared and found to reflect the nature of the approach. In addition to this finding, successhl students' beliefs about mathematics changed in two of the courses. In the one-to-one course the teacher focused initially on understanding the students' fear of mathematics and early mathematical experiences. The student-focused teaching approach trusted and encouraged the growth of ths student's mathematical thinking. Six months later the student felt empowered and had come to believe that mathematics as a creative and enjoyable process of discovering patterns. The second course focused on the mathematization of realistic situations. Successful students came to regard mathematics as useful, interesting, relating to real life. Successful students in the third course appreciated the carefully structured reintroduction to mathematics and were pleased they could finally do the mathematics they hadn't been able to understand at high school.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Education, Mathematics (0280)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/42</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Clarifying leadership:  The role of the school principal as an educational leader</field><field name="creator">Thew, Laurie</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the role of primary school principals as they undertake their role as educational leaders. Part One summarises theories about leadership and places principals' educational leadership in context. Leadership is defined as a social process whereby principals blend biography and context to reconcile positivist, systemic requirements and recommendations with appropriate localised, and individualised, expectations and aspirations.    Part Two outlines an ethnographic methodology that justifies a process to gather and analyse data on the work of three principal subjects. This material is presented in cameo form and supported by questionnaire data from a further group of principal colleagues. Principals' leadership is identified as the interpretation of expectations and resources that results in particular actions. This interpretation is sourced in both context and personal biography.    Part Three consists of data analysis and findings. The influence and interplay of context and personal biography are outlined. Conclusions are drawn as to the differences between leadership and management practices, and specific leadership activities performed by principals are identified. This leads to a clarification of leadership as a process of control (as opposed to power) that defines, rather than accommodates, the rules of realisation as to appropriate action. Recommendations are made regarding further study into the issues of personal identity, leadership style and the urgent need for principal pre-service and in-service professional development.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/43</field></doc><doc><field name="title">'Mr Jones' wives':  World War II war brides of New Zealand servicemen</field><field name="creator">Fortune, Gabrielle Ann</field><field name="description">Frederick Jones, Minister of Defence during World War II, was responsible for the transportation to New Zealand of the foreign-born wives and fianc&#233;es of New Zealand servicemen. Between 1942 and 1948 servicemen returning from theatres of war in Europe, the Middle East and the Pacific brought over 3000 wives and 700 fianc&#233;es to New Zealand. Portrayed as homogeneous, young, working-class British housewives who made hasty ill-considered marriages, war brides, in fact, proved to be varied in origin, age, occupation and education. Whirlwind romances and short courtships were not the norm. This thesis examines the consequences of the decision to marry a New Zealander and migrate and the impact of the journey and settlement. The full glare of publicity that greeted war brides on arrival focused attention on their compatibility with, and adaptability to, the receiving society. Adjustment was however fraught with difficulties.    Memory and loss are implicit in the experience of migration. War brides expressed this in terms of the rift with their pasts and a lack of shared memories. On arrival in New Zealand war brides dispersed around the country in an extreme 'pepper-potting' pattern. When their only connection with New Zealand was their locally-born husband they suffered social isolation and sometimes a devastating sense of loneliness. The resulting marginalisation they experienced was evident in their oral history narratives. Ambivalence and recourse to serendipity as an explanation for past actions were elements of the dis-composure discernable in narratives.    In spite of their varied religious, social and class backgrounds, this diverse cohort formed a war bride identity based on shared experience rather than national or ethnic origin. Far from dissipating, their war-bride identity has been consolidated into an enduring image most tangibly expressed in the extant war brides' clubs, although club attendance is not a prerequisite of war bride identity.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">HISTORY, MODERN (0582)</field><field name="subject">ANTHROPOLOGY, CULTURAL (0326)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/44</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Intercountry adoption of Eastern European children in New Zealand: Issues of culture</field><field name="creator">Scherman, Rhoda M</field><field name="description">Virtually all of the research on the ethnic identity development of children in intercountry adoption (ICA) has been on transracial adoptions (TRA). Little is known about the ethnic socialisation of internationally adopted children, raised in racially similar adoptive homes. Within the TRA literature, it has been found that transracially adopted children tend to ethnically identify with the white majority culture. That tendency has also been linked to adoptive parents' attitudes about the birth culture, and speculation that most parents are assimilating their children to the dominant culture. Research on TRA has also revealed that despite low ethnic identification, most adoptees score highly on indices of self-concept.    In the present study, 162 New Zealand adoptive families of European descent, with children adopted predominately from Eastern Europe, were surveyed concerning their experiences and attitudes about the importance of their children's birth culture. Results from the surveys showed that the majority of families engaged in a range of cultural activities, and made efforts to socialise with people of their child's birth ethnicity. In addition, most of the adoptive parents expressed a desire that their children ethnically identify with the birth culture, as well as with the New Zealand culture. Almost all of the families researched the birth country before travelling to collect their children, and most parents kept part or all of their child's original name.    A sub-sample of 52 of the adopted children was also interviewed in a second phase of the study. Measures of ethnic identity were obtained, using the Multigroup Ethnic Identity Measure (Phinney, 1992), as were adjustment scores, using the Piers-Harris Children's Self-Concept Scale (Piers, 1984). Findings revealed that overall, the children had moderate identification with the birth culture, and moderate to high self-concept scores, which were not correlated with one another other.    From the parent surveys, a scale was derived to assess the parent's sensitivity to culture. Known as the 'Cultural Sensitivity Measure' (CSM), this score was statistically compared to the children's ethnic identity scores, to test the assumption that the parents' attitudes about the birth culture would influence the children's ethnic identification with the birth culture. While the parents had moderate sensitivity scores, no relationship was found between the parents CSM scores and the children's MEIM scores.    Overall, these findings suggest that the internationally adopted children in New Zealand are well adjusted, interested in their ethnic origins, and being parented by New Zealanders who support the children's interest in their birth culture. Future areas of research were identified, and recommendations to families, professionals and policymakers were offered.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">PSYCHOLOGY, SOCIAL (0451)</field><field name="subject">PSYCHOLOGY, DEVELOPMENTAL (0620)</field><field name="subject">SOCIAL WORK (0452)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/45</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The investment risk of institutional-grade commercial real estate in Australia</field><field name="creator">Schuck, Edward John</field><field name="description">Knowledge of the investment risk of investment-grade commercial real estate (&#8216;ICRE&#8217;) is important because it determines the approaches which should be taken to portfolio management. However, relatively little is known about this risk.    This research expands the body of knowledge of ICRE investment risk by producing conclusions about the information content of prices and the distribution of returns in the ICRE context. It is broken into three main parts.    First, the ICRE returns-generating process is characterised to form a basis for deducing theoretical conclusions about the information content of prices and the stochastic attributes of returns. The rationale for this approach lies in capital markets literature, which demonstrates that the characteristics of the information structure of markets, the decision-making processes of investors and the market trading mechanism determine the main attributes of the process of price evolution (which is assumed to be the main driver of returns). The analysis concludes that ICRE prices are partially informed, and changes in prices are described by a &#8216;jump&#8217; process.    Second, analysis of a database of &#8216;large&#8217; price changes supplied by the Property Council of Australia is undertaken to empirically test the jump process hypothesis. This analysis provides evidence that natural events associated with changes in the leasing structure of properties are a primary driver of relatively large, infrequent dislocations in valuation-based prices.    With parts one and two as a backdrop, the third part of this research empirically tests a discrete mixture of normals (&#8216;DMON&#8217;) model of investment risk. Capital markets research shows that a DMON model flows naturally from jump price processes. DMON models fitted to cross-sectional returns on individual properties supplied by the PCA are found to be superior to the normal and stable Paretian models previously proposed by other researchers.    In aggregate these conclusions have serious implications for the management of ICRE portfolios, and suggest a need for additional research. Some implications include: (1) Mean-lower partial variance is superior to mean-variance optimisation. (2) Forecasting the distribution of ICRE returns forms a new tool for active management. (3) Passive portfolio management is inappropriate. (4) Comparables-based valuations may be unreliable for investment decisions.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ECONOMICS, FINANCE (0508)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/46</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Language matters:  The politics of teaching immigrant adolescents school English (New Zealand)</field><field name="creator">Kepa, Tangiwai Mere Appleton</field><field name="description">The purpose of this thesis is to reflect upon the complex process of educating the sons and daughters of immigrant parents from diverse cultural communities. The study stresses the importance of valuing the language and culture of students in Aotearoa-New Zealand for whom English is another language. It is argued that the discourse of what shall be called &#8216;technocratic pedagogy&#8217; falls short of meeting this goal. What is needed is more expansive and inclusive programmes that apprehend the social, economic, and political contexts of learning. This is necessary if the students are to continue their education not simply to absorb prescribed information and ideas but to actively understand, question, challenge, and change the school and the classroom.    The thesis is written from the perspective of an indigenous Maori teacher trained in technocratic approaches of practice looking to aspects of her intimate culture, Tongan and Samoan ways of representing the world, and Paulo Freire's critical pedagogy to transform contemporary education that tends to exclude the adolescents from learning in school. This thesis is not simply another contribution to the ways in which teachers of school English in general think about methodologies and approaches to learning; rather, it is addressed more specifically to those Maori, Tongan, and Samoan teachers in this country who work with and alongside communities who are from the Kingdom of Tonga and the islands of Samoa. Thus, there is great value placed on educational experience with indigenous Tongan and Samoan teachers and students in an educational project referred to in the thesis as a &#8216;School-within-a-school&#8217;. The School-within-a-school refers to a site of education for teaching school English to immigrant adolescents within a large, state, secondary school in the city of Auckland. Particular attention is also paid to educational experience with indigenous teachers in a Curriculum Committee and Maori and Tongan grassroots organisations located within the same school.    A fresh approach to teaching English accepts culture as the ground on which to begin to reflect on a practice within a specific context. The teachers who have a dynamic relationship with students argue that culture is a primary site for contradictions and that a revolutionary challenge to technocratic pedagogy is necessary, but not sufficient, to value and actively include the students in school. Since the English language and its attendant practices, values, traditions, and aspirations are the grounds for the students' marginalisation, immediate, consciously organised changes in the teaching beliefs, contents of education, and society at large in Aotearoa are necessary parts of any reintegrative pedagogy.    On this account, the belief is that pedagogy is vitally important since it can enable the students to understand the technocratic discourse and draw upon the personal and collective experiences to counter the tendency that denies them full participation in school and the classroom.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">EDUCATION, BILINGUAL AND MULTICULTURAL (0282)</field><field name="subject">EDUCATION, PHILOSOPHY OF (0998)</field><field name="subject">EDUCATION, SECONDARY (0533)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/47</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Myth, symbol, ornament: The loss of meaning in transition</field><field name="creator">Engels-Schwarzpaul, Anna-Christina</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">DESIGN AND DECORATIVE ARTS (0389)</field><field name="subject">ARCHITECTURE (0729)</field><field name="subject">PHILOSOPHY (0422)</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420300 Cultural Studies::420306 Maori cultural studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/48</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effect of some external factors on root hair demography in Trifolium repens L. and Lolium perenne L.</field><field name="creator">Care, Debbie Anne</field><field name="description">Light microscopy, low ionic strength solution culture and image analysis methods were used to make detailed measurements on root hair populations of different genotypes of white clover (Trifolium repens L.) and ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.). A model of root hair population structure was developed and validated that will facilitate research on root hairs of these species.    Diagrams were drawn of the root hair length and frequency on entire root systems. The distributions of root hairs on these diagrams often differed from textbook diagrams of root hairs because root hair length and frequency varied considerably along the root axis.    The key issue examined was the response at species, population and genotype levels of root hair populations perturbed by aluminium and phosphate, and the implications of these responses for our understanding of the strategies adopted by plants growing in stressful environments.    Demographic growth analysis gave the best understanding of the mechanisms of root hair population response to genetic variability, resource depletion and environmental perturbation. Root hair length seemed to be controlled by the individual root hair. However the number of root hairs appeared to be controlled by the root. Therefore it is the root that controls the distribution of the hairs on the root, and how this distribution is modified by perturbation.    Root hair populations were shown to have strategies that were similar to their shoot system growth strategies-guerrilla for clover, phalangeal for ryegrass. The root and root hair systems, and shoot systems also demonstrated similar characteristics when the r and K strategy model was applied. At an ecosystem level, clover and ryegrass occupied the same orthogonal in the CSR (competitive-stress-ruderal) model. Therefore at a larger scale, these plants are able to coexist, but they do this by having different strategies at a species level.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">BIOLOGY, BOTANY (0309)</field><field name="subject">BIOLOGY, ECOLOGY (0329)</field><field name="subject">BIOLOGY, PLANT PHYSIOLOGY (0817)</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270700 Ecology and Evolution::270702 Marine and estuarine ecology (incl. marine ichthyology)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/50</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Quantitative genetics of anthropometric variation in the Solomon Islands</field><field name="creator">Black, Stephen James</field><field name="description">This work follows the direction set by Sewall Wright in applying path analysis, and other multivariate statistical techniques, to the study of anthropometric variation. Data on anthropometric variation of six Solomon Island populations is analyzed using statistical models which can distinguish between within-group and between-group genetic variation.    The correlation structure of 27 anthropometric measurements is examined by cluster analysis and principal components analysis. The six populations show a common pattern (in both males and females) which echoes earlier studies. The correlation matrix of measurements is then partitioned into genetic and environmental components and the genetic correlation matrix is examined, once again by cluster analysis and principal components analysis. There is a fairly close agreement between the genetic correlation structure and the phenotypic correlation structure. The environmental correlation matrix is not examined further because it is very poorly estimated.    The partitioning of phenotypic correlations into genetic and environmental components is based on a multivariate generalization of a path model for the heritability of a continuous trait proposed by C. C. Li. The parameters estimated in the single trait model include additive genetic heritability, common home environment, and genetic correlation between spouses. In order to fit this model observations are required on parent-offspring, spouse-spouse, and sib-sib correlations. Heritability values for the Solomons are markedly lower than those reported elsewhere. However, when total heritability (ignoring subpopulation structure) is estimated for the six Solomons populations, the values are higher and form a more familiar pattern. The striking differences between the two kinds of heritability in the Solomon Islands emphasizes the danger of using total heritability estimates obtained from several subpopulations or a national sample.    The between-group component of heritability for each measurement is compared to the within-group heritability and to levels of between-group phenotypic variation. The results demonstrate that high within-group heritability for a given trait does not imply that between-group variation in that trait is genetic in origin.</field><field name="date">1983</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ANTHROPOLOGY, PHYSICAL (0327)</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370300 Anthropology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/51</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Writing ourselves 'home' : biographical texts : a method for contextualizing the lives of wahine Maori : locating the story of Betty Wark</field><field name="creator">Connor, D Helene</field><field name="description">This thesis consists of two sections. The intention of Section One, 'Biographical Texts: Theoretical Underpinning', is to explore and discuss the theoretical underpinnings of Maori feminism and Kaupapa Maori as they relate to biography as a research method into the lives of Maori women. Biography, as a literary genre is also examined with particular reference to feminist, women of colour and Maori biography. Section One is a wideranging section, encompassing a broad sweep of the literature in these areas. It both draws from existing literature and contributes to the discourse regarding Maori feminism, Maori biography and Maori research. It is relevant to but unconstrained by the content of Section Two. The intention of Section Two, 'Locating the Story of Betty Wark; A Biographical Narrative with Reflective Annotations', is to provide an example of the biographical method and what might constitute Maori biography. The subject of the biographical narrative, Betty Wark, was a Maori woman who was actively involved with community-based organisations from the 1950s until her death in May 2001. Several major themes which emerged from Betty's biographical history occur throughout her narrative and provide a framework in which her story is located. One of the most significant themes was the notion of 'home'; both literal and metaphorical. This theme is reflected in the title of the thesis, Writing Ourselves 'Home'.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Wark</field><field name="subject">Betty; Women</field><field name="subject">Maori Biography;Women</field><field name="subject">Maori Ethnic identity; Biography as a literary form</field><field name="subject">Women's Studies (0453)</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420300 Cultural Studies::420306 Maori cultural studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/53</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Stability and bifurcation of deterministic infectious disease models</field><field name="creator">Korobeinikov, Andrei</field><field name="description">Autonomous deterministic epidemiological models are known to be asymptotically stable. Asymptotic stability of these models contradicts observations. In this thesis we consider some factors which were suggested as able to destabilise the system. We consider discrete-time and continuous-time autonomous epidemiological models. We try to keep our models as simple as possible and investigate the impact of different factors on the system behaviour. Global methods of dynamical systems theory, especially the theory of bifurcations and the direct Lyapunov method are the main tools of our analysis.    Lyapunov functions for a range of classical epidemiological models are introduced. The direct Lyapunov method allows us to establish their boundedness and asymptotic stability. It also helps investigate the impact of such factors as susceptibles' mortality, horizontal and vertical transmission and immunity failure on the global behaviour of the system. The Lyapunov functions appear to be useful for more complicated epidemiological models as well.    The impact of mass vaccination on the system is also considered. The discrete-time model introduced here enables us to solve a practical problem-to estimate the rate of immunity failure for pertussis in New Zealand.    It has been suggested by a number of authors that a non-linear dependence of disease transmission on the numbers of infectives and susceptibles can reverse the stability of the system. However it is shown in this thesis that under biologically plausible constraints the non-linear transmission is unable to destabilise the system. The main constraint is a condition that disease transmission must be a concave function with respect to the number of infectives. This result is valid for both the discrete-time and the continuous-time models.    We also consider the impact of mortality associated with a disease. This factor has never before been considered systematically. We indicate mechanisms through which the disease-induced mortality can affect the system and show that the disease-induced mortality is a destabilising factor and is able to reverse the system stability. However the critical level of mortality which is necessary to reverse the system stability exceeds the mortality expectation for the majority of human infections. Nevertheless the disease-induced mortality is an important factor for understanding animal diseases.    It appears that in the case of autonomous systems there is no single factor able to cause the recurrent outbreaks of epidemics of such magnitudes as have been observed. It is most likely that in reality they are caused by a combination of factors.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::230000 Mathematical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/54</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A comparison of the effect of implicit/explicit and immediate/delayed corrective feedback on learners' performance in tailor-made test</field><field name="creator">Varnosfadrani, Azizollah Dabaghi</field><field name="description">The study investigated the effects of correction of learners' grammatical errors on acquisition. Specifically, it compared the effects of timing of correction (immediate versus delayed correction) and manner of correction (explicit versus implicit correction). It also investigated the relative effects of correction of morphological versus syntactic features and correction of developmental early versus developmental late features. Data for the study were collected from 56 intermediate level students of English as a Foreign Language in Iranian university and private language school settings. Each participant was required to read and then retell a written text in their own words during an oral interview with the researcher. During or following the interview the researcher corrected the participants on their grammatical errors implicitly (using recasts) or explicitly (providing metalinguistic information). Individualised tests focusing on the errors that had been corrected were constructed for each participant and administered. Statistical analyses were conducted on the scores the participants received on their individualised tests. Results showed no significant differences for timing of correction. However, significant differences were found for manner of correction. Participants who received explicit correction gained significantly higher scores than those who received implicit correction. This finding lends support to the argument of Schmidt (1994) concerning the role of metalinguistic awareness in language acquisition. Correction of morphological features was found to be more effective than that of syntactic features. It is argued that morphological features are generally learnt as items whereas syntactic features involve system learning. Correction of developmental early features was found to be more effective than correction of developmental late features. This finding lends support to suggestions that corrective feedback (like other types of form-focused instruction) needs to take into account learners' cognitive readiness to acquire features (Pienemann 1984; Mackey 1999). iii Analyses of the interactions between independent variables were also conducted. It was found that explicit correction was more effective for the acquisition of developmental early features and implicit correction was more effective for the acquisition of developmental late features The implications of these results for both second language acquisition and language pedagogy are considered.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Language, General (0679)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/55</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Exploring notions of national style : New Zealand orchestral music in the late twentieth century</field><field name="creator">Keam, Glenda Ruth</field><field name="description">The question of cultural identity in New Zealand literature, visual art and music has been an important one for many decades. New Zealand's relative isolation, sparse population, short history and colonial past have all contributed to a heightened national awareness of, and sensitivity to, its cultural condition. This study aims to explore, with an analyst's eye and ear, notions of national style through a group of orchestral works. Contemporary critical musicology, which flourished in the 1990s, typically integrates various frames of reference and suggests that analysis be framed in the broader cultural context of a work's genesis and performance. Examining the ways in which New Zealand's notions of national identity have affected its artistic production, this study considers claims that the particular environmental conditions of the land have imprinted themselves onto the nation's music. Furthermore, it investigates claims that New Zealand's remote and open spaces have generated perceptible effects in the nation's musical style, while also asking whether the purported importance of the landscape is not actually a myth which sits alongside the nation's other myths of identity. The literature regarding notions of 'musical space' is surveyed, bringing to light a number of musical elements which may connote space. Seven New Zealand orchestral works, composed between 1976 and 1995 and signalled by the composers as having some connection with the land, are found to share musical features, thus suggesting a national style insofar as 'landscape' works from this period are concerned. I then examine the works for 'space' elements, to investigate whether there are identifiable elements which connote a 'sense of space' in New Zealand music. A corollary of this belief in a national style is that any influences at work from New Zealand land(scapes) on New Zealand music will produce different musical results from those at work from other land(scapes) on music in other countries. After noting the most prevalent musical elements in the New Zealand works, four comparable 'landscape' orchestral works from other countries are also discussed, in order to offset and contextualize the New Zealand findings. This is the first detailed study of New Zealand music that has investigated national style, concepts of landscape-in-music, and musical space through analytical examination. It thus contributes to the small but growing body of New Zealand musical studies, and to an overall picture of New Zealand cultural identity.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Music (0413)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/56</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Using context to enhance students' understanding of decimal fractions</field><field name="creator">Irwin, Kathryn Cressey</field><field name="description">A total of 84 students from a lower economic area, aged 8 to 14, were interviewed about their understanding of decimal fractions. Results showed that most students could give a context in which they saw decimal fractions outside of school. The vast majority could draw a diagram of how a cake or field could be divided equally among 10 or 100 people. However, few students under 14 could give either decimal fraction symbols or common fraction symbols to represent these divisions. Less than half of the students at ages 10, 11 and 12 could visualize what might come between 0 and 1. About half of the students aged 11 and 12 could indicate what 0.1 or 0.01 meant. It was inferred that difficulty in relating these symbols to referents might be an important source of difficulty in understanding decimal fractions. Therefore, these interviews were followed by an intervention study that examined if working with contextualized decimal fractions aided understanding of these numbers when they were presented without context. Half of a group of 16 similar students, aged 11 and 12, were asked to solve problems in which numbers that incorporated decimal fractions were contextualized, and the other half were asked to solve similar problems given in purely numerical form. Students worked in pairs, on problems which incorporated common misconceptions. The group who worked on contextualized problems gained significantly more understanding than did the group that worked on purely numerical problems, as measured by the difference between pretest and posttest scores. Transcripts of the students' discussions were analysed for the effect of prior learning, aspects of peer collaboration that appeared to be beneficial to learning, and the effect of cognitive conflict. The students who gained most from collaboration were not too distant in initial expertise, showed a degree of social equity, and worked on contextualized problems. Much of students' learning appeared to result from needing to reconsider their views following a conflict between their expectations and the results of operating on a calculator or in writing, or hearing an alternative view.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">EDUCATION, MATHEMATICS (0280)</field><field name="subject">EDUCATION, ELEMENTARY (0524)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/57</field></doc><doc><field name="title">'The London Prodigal': A critical edition in modern spelling</field><field name="creator">Arulanandam, Santha Devi</field><field name="description">This thesis presents a critical edition in modern spelling of The London Prodigal, a comedy played by the King's Men and printed in 1605 by Thomas Creede for the publisher Nathaniel Butter. The title-page (photographically reproduced) attributes the play to William Shakespeare. This claim is assessed and judged to be mistaken. Both external and internal evidence have been examined in relation to eight possible authorship candidates; Thomas Dekker emerges as the strongest. The present text of the play is based on the 1605 Quarto. Collation of twelve copies revealed several press variants.    The introduction treats the play's publication and stage-history and takes a critical look at its background and sources, plot and structure, setting, characters, style, themes, and role in the development of Elizabethan-Jacobean drama. An attempt is made to determine the date of composition, as well as the author. A short section is devoted to conjecture about the manuscript copy used for the Quarto and to bibliographical deductions about its treatment in the printing-house.    A full commentary glosses obscurities and enlarges on the play's literary, social, and historical allusions. There are textual notes on variants, emendations, and lineation.

The results of the literary analysis indicated that the texts displayed different textual tendencies and also represented God, the four main characters, and some minor characters, differently. The texts were then presented to real readers for an empirical study of their perceptions of the characters. The empirical data indicate some support for the difference in perception expected from the literary analysis.    Readers of the AT considered the king to be more just, Mordecai to be more just and moral, and less dominant, and Esther to be more moral, than in the other two texts. Readers of the BT considered Mordecai more dominant than in the other two texts. For the justice of the king and the justice and morality of Mordecai they rated the BT between the AT and the MT. Readers of the MT considered the king to be less just and Mordecai to be less just and moral than in the other texts. However, for the dominance trait they rated Mordecai between the AT and BT. They also rated Esther between the AT and BT on the morality trait. Some of these effects, however, were modified by the factors of gender and religious affiliation.    The literary analysis also suggested that there is a difference in the moral reasoning level between the three texts. This was indirectly supported by the empirical study. The fact that all except one of the differences in perception were related to the character traits of justice and morality indicates that the character traits which are most obviously related to the ethics involved in the text were the ones for which real readers perceived differences.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">THEOLOGY (0469)</field><field name="subject">RELIGION, BIBLICAL STUDIES (0321)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/59</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of brands in manufacturer-reseller relationships</field><field name="creator">Glynn, Mark Selwyn</field><field name="description">The focus of this research is on the role of manufacturer brands for resellers within retail channels. This topic is important because of the strategic value of manufacturer brands and the increasing influence of resellers within channels of distribution. Much of the branding research has emphasised a customer brand knowledge perspective, however emerging perspectives suggest that brands are also relevant to other stakeholders including resellers. In contrast channels research has recognised the manufacturer sources of market power, but has not considered the impact of manufacturer 'push and pull' strategies within channels. A comprehensive theoretical framework therefore did not exist that addressed the reseller perspective of the brand. As a result, a multi-method research design was adopted and consisted of two phases. The first phase involved in-depth interviews, from which a conceptual framework was developed. In the second phase this framework was tested by means of a survey of supermarket buyers on major and minor brands in several product categories. Structural equation modelling was used to analyse the survey responses. The structural model showed very good fit to the data and good construct validity, reliability and stability. Brands have several sources of value to resellers including manufacturer support, brand preference and customer demand which influence the reseller satisfaction with the brand. Reseller satisfaction in turn influences other channel outcomes such as trust, commitment and performance. Minor brands are better able to influence trust and commitment than major brands. A key contribution of this research is the development of a validated conceptual framework on the value of the brand in inter-organisational relationships from the point of view of a reseller. This research shows that it is the resources associated with the brand, not just the brand itself that creates value for resellers in channel relationships.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Business Administration, Marketing (0338)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/60</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of contemporary echocardiography in the management of heart failure</field><field name="creator">Whalley, Gillian Amanda</field><field name="description">Heart failure (HF) is an increasing and leading cause of cardiovascular morbidity, hospitalisation and death. Echocardiography is often used in HF patients because it provides important aetiological, diagnostic and prognostic information to assist physician management at moderate cost. This thesis has explored contemporary echocardiographic techniques for assessment of both diastolic and systolic function to ascertain their effectiveness and optimal utility. Assessment of systolic function in HF patients is optimised by the use of harmonic imaging and not enhanced with the use of transpulmonary contrast agents, whilst diastolic filling is optimised by the use of preload manipulation. When optimised in this way, echocardiography can be used to stratify HF patients in terms of risk of death and/or hospitalisation after discharge from hospital. This was confirmed in a meta-analysis of more than 6000 patients (1000 deaths) with HF or after acute myocardial infarction (AMI), where the presence of restrictive filling pattern (the most severe form of diastolic dysfunction) was associated with a four-fold increase in mortality in both patient groups. In addition, restrictive filling pattern also predicted development of HF post AMI and hospitalisation in patients with HF. This meta-analysis also evaluated the intermediate stages of diastolic dysfunction and found a stepped relationship between each grade and prognosis. The last part of this thesis explored the role of contemporary echocardiography for management of symptomatic patients in the community and found that the diagnosis of HF in the community may be optimised by using brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) as a first test to "rule-out" heart failure and then echocardiography, which was superior to BNP in patients with intermediate BNP levels to diagnose HF. Furthermore, the systolic echocardiographic parameters were important for diagnosis, whilst the diastolic parameters predicted future hospitalisation. In summary, contemporary echocardiography in HF patients should include comprehensive assessment of systolic function (using tissue harmonics imaging) and diastolic filling (utilising preload manipulation). This approach will optimise both diagnosis and prognosis and in turn may aid physician management.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Health Sciences, Medicine and Surgery (0564)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/61</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Beyond responsiveness to community:  Democratic voice and the creation of an&gt;education alternative (New Zealand)</field><field name="creator">Carpenter, Vicki Marie</field><field name="description">This thesis examines how, in a rural New Zealand &#8216;area school&#8217;, successful democratic parental and community voice was able to bring about the creation of an education alternative. While the parental initiative was in line with the rhetoric of Tomorrow' s Schools (1988) the contention in this thesis is that initiatives such as this were not intended by the legislation. Despite the fact that the initiative was stimulated by and explicitly invoked the rhetoric, the spirit of the legislation was philosophically opposed to this particular kind of innovation.    The &#8216;Kiwi&#8217; initiative emerged in 1993, five years after the legislation. The initiative centred around a request for an alternative education programme to be set up within &#8216;Takiwa School&#8217;. This alternative was modelled on Playcentre, a New Zealand Early Childhood Education model, which encompasses aspects of progressivism. Kiwi parents and Takiwa School personnel achieved a &#8216;school within the school&#8217; for a segment of Takiwa community. Parents became fully involved in all aspects of their children's curriculum, from planning, through to delivery and assessment. This thesis examines the politics of the change process within Takiwa School.    Three questions are central to this case study examination of change. These are: What were the parents asking for? How were the parents able to achieve what they were asking for? and What were the effects of the process on what it was that the initiative ultimately became? These three questions are examined in a sociological manner, from a critical realist approach. A range of theoretical tools are utilised; the central theoretical windows are a combination of Exit, Voice and Loyalty-which is provided by Hirschman (1970)-and the theories which are encompassed in the New Institutionalist approach. The central argument of the thesis is that it was a particular combination of conditions and motivations which made the Kiwi innovation possible. The possible replicability of the initiative is discussed. A key concern of the thesis as a whole is whether the set of circumstances in which the innovation transpired was unique.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">EDUCATION, SOCIOLOGY OF (0340)</field><field name="subject">SOCIOLOGY, SOCIAL STRUCTURE AND DEVELOPMENT (0700)</field><field name="subject">EDUCATION, ADMINISTRATION (0514)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/62</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Teachers' conceptions of assessment</field><field name="creator">Brown, Gavin Thomas Lumsden</field><field name="description">Teachers' conceptions are powerful in shaping the quality of their instructional practice. The purpose of this thesis is to defend a four-facet model of teachers' conceptions of assessment, which revolves around emphasising improvement or school accountability, or student accountability purposes or treating assessment as irrelevant. Further, it explores how those conceptions relate to teachers' conceptions of learning, teaching, curriculum, and teacher efficacy.    A literature review is used to identify the major conceptions. Multiple studies led to a 50-item Teachers' Conceptions of Assessment (COA-III) questionnaire based on the four main conceptions of assessment. Structural equation modelling showed a close fit of a hierarchical, multi-dimensional model to the data. Teachers moderately agreed with the improvement conceptions and the system accountability conception. Teachers disagreed that assessment was irrelevant. However, teachers had little agreement that assessment was for student accountability. Improvement, school, and student accountability conceptions were positively correlated. The irrelevance conception was inversely related to the improvement conception and not related to the system accountability conception.    A four-factor structure of teachers' beliefs about assessment, curriculum, teaching, learning, and teacher efficacy, was found. Teachers agreed that assessment influences and improves their teaching and student learning. They agreed less strongly that assessment, measuring surface learning only, makes schools, teachers, and students accountable and that teachers are able to conduct assessment through a systematic technological approach. They agreed at a similar level with student centred learning that involves deep approaches to learning, divorced from assessment. They disagreed with a telling type of teaching that focuses only on intellectual development of students or on reconstruction or reform of society.    Use of the CoA-III makes teachers' conceptions of assessment more explicit and will assist in the development of teacher training programs, the design of assessment policy, and enhance further research into educational assessment practices. Furthermore, explicit attention to teachers' conceptions of assessment is expected to be a precursor to teachers' self-regulation of their assessment beliefs and practices.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">EDUCATION, EDUCATIONAL PSYCHOLOGY (0525)</field><field name="subject">EDUCATION, TESTS AND MEASUREMENTS (0288)</field><field name="subject">EDUCATION, ELEMENTARY (0524)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/63</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A history of the action of deceit on the case and related developments in contract law</field><field name="creator">Bunbury, John C</field><field name="description">My thesis traces the common law&#8217;s initial inability to provide a remedy for fraudulent contract-making other than that provided in the action of deceit on the case for a breach of warranty. By and large this was the result of an evidential rule in covenant that a contract had to be evidenced in a sealed instrument (ie. a specialty). This test for an assumption of contractual obligation prevented the courts from receiving inferior oral evidence of fraud in defence to the contract. A limited remedy for fraud was provided in the form of the action of deceit on the case where liability was based on tricking another person into contracting on the basis of a false warranty. Evidence of fraud in the action of deceit on the case was reduced to proving a breach of warranty. Any injustice created by the common law&#8217;s inability to provide a defence or remedy for other types of fraudulent contract-making was either relieved in equity, or through the passage of time and gradual common law development, by new common law actions, rules of evidence and methods of trial. By far the most significant development in this regard was the establishment of a remedy for fraud in money had and received in the late seventeenth century, which led to the common law rule allowing for rescission of a contract for fraud. Any money passed under the fraudulently induced contract could be recovered in money had and received following rescission. Likewise, the value of any personal property transferred under the fraudulently induced contract could be recovered in trover following a rescission. Related developments saw warranties become actionable in special assumpsit (ie. contract), and a generic remedy for actual fraud develop in the modern tort of deceit.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/64</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Women's agency in the North Shore and Waitakere cities of Auckland (New Zealand)</field><field name="creator">Billot, Jennie Margaret</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the ways in which women assess and seek resources in their urban contexts. I argue that the struggles of daily life in local communities and institutional groups can produce ideological spaces into which new practices, arising from increased consciousness of issues, can be developed.    My aim has been to uncover women's experiences in a way that not only interprets meanings from their practices, but also encourages such practices to be seen as valid renderings of women's understandings. I examine women's initiatives through the analysis of varying contexts. While I acknowledge the historical importance of the domestic situation as a threshold for much historic activism, women's proactivity requires a broader situational analysis. I therefore present cases of proactivity within the domestic, public and business spheres, within the two cities of Waitakere and North Shore of Auckland, New Zealand.    Through the search for new progressive social identities, women's activities at the inter-personal level are a prime source of social change. It is through the recursive relationship between women as agents and the social structure, that changing interpretations of social expectations are produced, allowing for creative activism. While women's initiatives may aim to transform particular social environments, they become part of the incremental process of change that alters the experience and structure of women's lives.    The thesis has four parts. The first outlines the scope, objectives and theoretical framework, while the second conceptualises women's agency and its positioning within social gendered structures. Part Three presents the investigative processes linking the theoretical framework and the empirical analysis. Part Four submits the thematic interpretations of the thesis, concluding that women can be agents of social change in a diversity of ways.    I acknowledge my feminist stance, one with layerings of objectives and motivations. I view women's circumstances as resulting from the interweaving of structural forces and personal capacities. The resulting awareness of women's experiences can challenge the values and concepts of masculine discourses. This is viewed through the concept of multiplicity. On a political level this means creating a resistance to hierarchies and a commitment to a plurality of voice, style and structure.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">GEOGRAPHY (0366)</field><field name="subject">SOCIOLOGY, INDIVIDUAL AND FAMILY STUDIES (0628)</field><field name="subject">WOMEN'S STUDIES (0453)</field><field name="subject">SOCIOLOGY, SOCIAL STRUCTURE AND DEVELOPMENT (0700)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/65</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fofoa-i-vao-'ese : the identity journeys of NZ-born Samoans</field><field name="creator">Anae, Melani</field><field name="description">This thesis constitutes a site for New Zealand-born Samoans to explore issues of ethnic identity.

The stories and narratives of a group of New Zealandborn Samoans concerning their life experiences provide valuable insights into their 'identity journeys'--the construction of ethnic identity through experimenting with subject positions over time, as a result of challenges to their percieved self-identities. For some, this journey ends with a secured identity--a self-satisfying ethnic identity as a New Zealand-born Samoan--others remain in a perpetual state of conscious or subconscious identity confusion. More specifically the thesis seeks to provide an understanding and an interpretation of the way fa'aSamoa, church, and life in New Zealand impacts on life choices and on the construction of the self, and secured identities. The identity journey is analysed as a ritual and a series of rites of passage in order to expose the structure of identity confusion, and to examine the dichotomy of chaos and conflict within an apparently ordered society, experienced by New Zealand-born Samoans during their identity journeys.The thesis is therefore underpinned by Samoan conceptual frameworks involved in this identity journey, and aims to consciousness-raise and emancipate by exposing, understanding and reclaiming the links between fa'aSamoa, church, and a New Zealand born Samoan identity.The thesis represents an 'ie toga,  because like a fine mat being woven, the strands of Samoan history, fa'aSamoa and Samoan contemporary lifeways, and their interaction with 'others' interconnect to inform Samoan identity. It is thus presented with respect, gratitude, deference, recognition and obligation, a tangible symbol of an alliance and an exchange with all Samoans and others. As the wellspring of my Samoan identity, in its creativity in design and fineness of weave, I hope that this 'ie toga will be received as a source of identity, history and wealth.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Anthropology, Cultural (0326)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/66</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modelling of bath/ledge  heat transfer in Hall-Heroult cells</field><field name="creator">Wei, Chuck Chenchi</field><field name="description">Heat transfer through the sidewall accounts for a significant proportion of the energy loss from an aluminium reduction cell. At the same time, the ledge formed on the sidewall has important consequences with regards to the cell service life and the dynamic heat balance during various disturbances associated with the smelting operation such as alumina feeding, anode changing, metal tapping and anode effect. Several studies have been carried out to investigate the ledge heat transfer. However, the reported heat transfer coefficients in the literature not only vary over a wide range of values but provide insufficient information on the ledge heat transfer.    A heat transfer probe and measurement techniques were developed for studying the ledge heat transfer in a full-scale 3-D air-water model. Quantitative measurements were conducted to determine the bath/ledge heat transfer characteristics at various positions, and under different operating conditions such as anode-ledge distance, current density and bath depth. Variation of the heat transfer were also examined as a function of the anode bottom inclination, the anode slot width and the position on the side ledge relative to the anode slot. The results illustrate that the ledge profile in an operating cell will take on a different shape in compliance with the heat transfer variation.    A similitude analysis was carried out to interpret the measured results in a meaningful manner for use in a reduction cell. As a result, the heat transfer coefficient in industrial cells under various operating parameters, and at different positions on the side ledge, can be estimated using the empirical correlations presented.    Gas bubble behaviour and bubble impingement on the side ledge were observed in the water model. Observations made on the 2-D and 3-D water models indicate that anode gas evolution in the 3-D model cell will reflect more closely the flow pattern in actual cells and hence provide more reliable quantitative results.    A simple 2-D thermal model for the prediction of ledge thickness and profile as a moving boundary was developed and solved simply and efficiently with a commercial spreadsheet software using the finite difference method. The ledge profile was predicted using the ledge heat transfer coefficients measured extensively from the full-scale 3-D physical model. The results show that the ledge shape is highly sensitive to the positional variation of the heat transfer coefficient. It is also shown that the ledge heat transfer coefficients obtained from industrial measurements assuming 1-D heat flow are much lower than the actual values in a Hall-Heroult cell.    A transient thermal model derived by considering the Stefan problem$/sp[*]$ for the sidewall/ledge region was developed. A fixed-grid and deforming-grid spacing were respectively superimposed on the sidewall and the ledge region in order to track the moving front of the phase change zone. Various aspects of the process dynamics with respect to the variation of ledge thickness and sidewall shell temperature were presented. The model considered dynamic heat loss through the sidewall which results in a closer approximation to the real situation. ftn$/sp[*]$N.B.: In the strict sense the problem of the ledge is not a classical Stefan problem. The classical Stefan problem involves conduction on both sides of the interface. The ledge problem involves conduction on the side and convection on the other.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ENGINEERING, CHEMICAL (0542)</field><field name="subject">ENGINEERING, METALLURGY (0743)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/67</field></doc><doc><field name="title">New methods for analysis of epidemiological data using capture-recapture methods</field><field name="creator">Huakau, John Tupou</field><field name="description">Capture-recapture methods take their origins from animal abundance estimation, where they were used to estimate the unknown size of the animal population under study. In the late 1940s and again in the late 1960s and early 1970s these same capture-recapture methods were modified and applied to epidemiological list data. Since then through their continued use, in particular in the 1990s, these methods have become popular for the estimation of the completeness of disease registries and for the estimation of the unknown total size of human disease populations.    In this thesis we investigate new methods for the analysis of epidemiological list data using capture-recapture methods. In particular we compare two standard methods used to estimate the unknown total population size, and examine new methods which incorporate list mismatch errors and model-selection uncertainty into the process for the estimation of the unknown total population size and its associated confidence interval. We study the use of modified tag loss methods from animal abundance estimation to allow for list mismatch errors in the epidemio-logical list data. We also explore the use of a weighted average method, the use of Bootstrap methods, and the use of a Bayesian model averaging method for incorporating model-selection uncertainty into the estimate of the unknown total population size and its associated confidence interval. In addition we use two previously unanalysed Diabetes studies to illustrate the methods examined and a well-known Spina Bifida Study for simulation purposes.    This thesis finds that ignoring list mismatch errors will lead to biased estimates of the unknown total population size and that the list mismatch methods considered here result in a useful adjustment. The adjustment also approximately agrees with the results obtained using a complex matching algorithm. As for the incorporation of model-selection uncertainty, we find that confidence intervals which incorporate model-selection uncertainty are wider and more appropriate than confidence intervals that do not. Hence we recommend the use of tag loss methods to adjust for list mismatch errors and the use of methods that incorporate model-selection uncertainty into both point and interval estimates of the unknown total population size.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">MATHEMATICS (0405)</field><field name="subject">STATISTICS (0463)</field><field name="subject">BIOLOGY, BIOSTATISTICS (0308)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/68</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Unfinished: The Seventh-day Adventist mission in the South Pacific, excluding Papua New Guinea, 1886-1986.

When that mission was finished the second coming would occur.    In 1886 following a visit by an elderly layman, John I Tay, the whole population of Pitcairn Island desired to join the SDA church. As a result in 1890 Adventist mission work began in the South Pacific Islands. By 1895 missions had been founded in six island groups. However difficulties, both within and without the mission's control, ensured that membership gains were painfully slow in the first decades of Adventist mission in Polynesia. However before World War II the Solomons became one of the most successful Adventist mission areas in the world. After 1945 Adventism also prospered in such places as Fiji, Samoa and Tonga.    Education provided the key to the gaining of accessions in a number of countries, while in others a health-medical emphasis proved important in attracting converts. Since World War II public evangelism and the use of various programmes such as welfare, radio evangelism, and the efforts of lay members contributed to sharp membership gains in most countries of the region. Of no small consequence in hindering Adventist growth was the opposition of other churches who regarded them as pariahs because of their theology and 'proselytizing'.    Adventist communities tended to be introverted, esoteric and isolationist. Nevertheless Pacific islanders adapted aspects of the usually uncompromising Adventist culture. Unity of faith, practice and procedure was a valuable Adventist asset which was promoted by a centralized administration.    After a century in the Pacific region its membership there has a reputation among other Adventists for its continued numeric growth and for the ferver its committment to Adventism. Nevertheless Adventism in the region faces a number of problems and its aim of finishing the Lord's work remains unfinished.</field><field name="date">1990</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">HISTORY, ASIA, AUSTRALIA AND OCEANIA (0332)</field><field name="subject">RELIGION, HISTORY OF (0320)</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::440000 Philosophy and Religion::440200 Religion and Religious Traditions::440204 Christian theology (incl.

Flow is modelled through these networks enabling structure-function simulations to be conducted to increase our understanding of this complex system.Voronoi meshing is applied in a novel technique to represent the three-dimensional structure of the alveoli, and the corresponding capillary plexus intimately wrapped over the alveolar surface. This technique is used to create the alveolar-capillary structure of a single alveolar sac,  closely representing the geometry measured in anatomical studies.A Poiseuille type flow solution technique is implemented within the capillary geometry. The solution procedure incorporates calculations of red and white blood cell transit time frequencies. Novel predictions of regional microcirculatory blood cell transit in the anatomically-realistic alveolar-capillary model compare well with experimental measures.An anatomically-based finite element model of the arterial and venous vessels, down to the level of their accompanying respiratory bronchioles, is created using a combination of imaging and computational algorithms, which includes generation of supernumerary vessels. Large arterial and venous vessels and lobar geometries are derived from multi-detector row x-ray computed tomography (MDCT) scans. From these MDCT vessel end points a volume-filling branching algorithm is used to generate the remaining blood vessels that accompany the airways into the MDCT-derived host volume. An  empirically-based algorithm generates supernumerary blood vessels - unaccompanied by airways that branch to supply the closest parenchymal tissue. This new approach produces a model of pulmonary vascular geometry that is far more anatomically-realistic than previous models in the literature.A reduced form of the Navier-Stokes equations are solved within the vascular geometries to yield pressure, radius, and velocity distributions. Inclusion of a gravitational term in the governing equations allows application of the model in investigating the relative effects of gravity, structure, and posture on regional perfusion.Gravity is shown to have a lesser influence on blood flow distribution than suggested by earlier experimental studies, and by comparison between different model solutions the magnitude of the gravitational flow gradient is predicted. This study clearly demonstrates the significant role that  symmetric vascular branching has in determining the distribution of blood  flow. The influence of branching geometry is revealed by solution in symmetric, human, and ovine vascular models.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Pulmonary Alveoli physiology;Lung Physiology;Models</field><field name="subject">Biological</field><field name="subject">Engineering, Biomedical (0541)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/70</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Teacher Appraisal: Missed Opportunities for Learning</field><field name="creator">Sinnema, Claire</field><field name="description">The improvement of teaching is now recognised to be a key to the sustained improvement of student achievement. Teacher appraisal, a central element of performance management, is intended to improve the quality of teaching (and therefore learning). This thesis examines whether teacher appraisal is achieving this purpose, through three empirical studies. This thesis begins with a discussion of the context of teacher appraisal in relation to education reform of the last two decades. A normative model of teacher appraisal, one that focuses on data-based inquiry into student learning, is outlined, and the emerging education context in relation to that model is examined. Three studies, which explored schools' appraisal documents, appraisal discussions and teachers' appraisal goals, are presented. The first study, a document analysis, investigated the emphasis on student learning in the statements of purpose in 17 primary schools' appraisal policies, and the emphasis on student learning in the performance indicators developed to assess teachers against the professional standards. Results showed that while improved student learning was an intended purpose of schools' appraisal policies, the indicators that were used to evaluate teachers seldom focused directly on student learning.The second study examined whether data-based inquiry into student learning occurs in appraisal discussions, and the reasons for the level of reported inquiry. Eleven practitioners (four appraisers and seven appraisees from three schools) were interviewed about their most recent appraisal discussion to investigate whether student learning was a focus of the appraisal discussions and whether student achievement data were referred to in those discussions. Findings showed that appraisal discussions typically focused on teacher practices without exploring connections between those practices and the impact they have on student learning.Only one of the eleven teachers described a discussion that included talk specifically about student learning. Furthermore, there were no reports of reference to student learning data in appraisal discussions. There was, however, a particularly positive response to the suggestion that appraisal should, and could, focus on student learning and on data relating to this learning. This study also highlighted the considerable influence of appraisal goals in determining the content and scope of appraisals. In the third study, 68 teachers from eight schools responded to a questionnaire about their appraisal goals to establish the extent to which teachers' appraisal goals focus on data-based inquiry into student learning. Less than five per cent of goals were found to refer to student outcomes. The vast majority focused on teacher processes and behaviours. Goals also tended to be vague, rather than specific, and were not explicitly challenging. Findings across the studies suggest that only limited attention is given, in critical elements of teacher appraisal, to student learning. The final chapter of the thesis explores two key strategies for closing the gap between current appraisal practices and the 'appraisal for learning' approach argued for here - an approach that focuses on teacher learning about student learning and that is based on evidence. The first strategy involves alignment within appraisal elements, and to initiatives beyond appraisal. The second strategy is capacity building to ensure that personal, interpersonal and organisational capacities necessary for 'appraisal for learning' are developed. This research shows how teacher appraisal policy and practice has been a missed opportunity to improve teaching effectiveness and how it could be reshaped in ways that maximise student learning.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/71</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation of Neumann-Kelvin ship wave theory and its application to yacht design</field><field name="creator">Marr, Gregory Paul</field><field name="description">Wave drag significantly affects ship powering and speed prediction calculations, and the performance of sailing yachts. Linear Neumann-Kelvin ship wave theory is taken as a starting point for the development of a computational approach for predicting water flow about yacht hulls. Previous work by Baar and Price, Newman, and Doctors and Beck for the calculation of the Kelvin source and its derivatives and their use with panel methods is repeated, refined and extended.    Consistent and accurate results are obtained for numerical tests and Farell's submerged spheroid test cases.    Baar and Price's results for the Wigley hullform (which compare well with experiments) were not able to be duplicated in the present study, despite significant tests of both local and integrated solution values. The tests did indicate that the current implementation was behaving correctly, and gave wave resistance results equivalent to those from Doctors and Beck's study, to a level of agreement which contrasted sharply with the wide scatter in Chen and Noblesse's survey. These results remove to some extent numerical inaccuracies as a postulated source of the theory's difficulties, leaving the conclusion that Neuman-Kelvin theory, as it is currently understood, does not give satisfactory wave resistance results for realistic ship hullforms.    These and further results lead to, and reinforce, the suggestion that the problem lies with the waterline integral term; a new treatment of this term may substantially increase the applicability of Neumann-Kelvin theory.    The extensions required for modelling sailing yachts are considered. Investigation of three yacht design problems show that the developed model can predict, and partly explain, previously observed free surface effects. These 'relative' effects may be adequately predicted even though the absolute results appear less reliable.    For the simplified parabolic yacht hullform tested, the sideforce is relatively constant over the speed range generally relevant to upwind sailing, and well modelled by the (zero Froude number) cosine squared (heel angle) relationship. The effects of a bulb, and heel (for the Wigley hullform), on wave resistance are shown.    Suggestions for further work, calculation details, and tables of wave resistance and Kelvin source (and gradient) values are given.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ENGINEERING, MARINE AND OCEAN (0547)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/72</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Primary and secondary log breakdown simulation</field><field name="creator">Todoroki, Christine Louisa</field><field name="description">Log breakdown by sawing can be viewed as a multi-phase process that converts logs into boards by a series of cutting operations. In the primary phase, logs are sawn into s labs of wood known as flitches or cants. These are further processed by secondary operations, that resaw, edge (cut lengthwise) and trim (cut widthwise) the raw material, resulting in the manufacture of the board product whose value is influenced by its composite dimensions and quality (as indicated by a grade). Board grade is in turn determined by the number, type, size, and location of defects.    Owing to its biological origins, each log, and subsequent board, is unique. Furthermore, as each sawmill, and processing centre within the mill, has a unique configuration, the problem of determining how each log entering a mill should be sawn is very complex. Effective computer simulation of log breakdown processes must therefore entail detailed descriptions of both geometry and quality of individual logs. Appropriate strategies at each breakdown phase are also required.    In this thesis models for emulating log breakdown are developed in conjunction with an existing sawing simulation system which requires, as input, detailed three-dimensional descriptions of both internal and external log characteristics. Models based on heuristic and enumerative procedures, and those based upon the principles of dynamic programming (DP) are formulated, encoded, and compared. Log breakdown phases are considered both independently and in a combined integrated approach-working backwards from the board product through to the primary log breakdown phase. This approach permits methodology developed for the later processes to be embedded within the primary phase thus permitting the determination of a global rather than local solution to the log breakdown problem whose objective is to seek the highest possible solution quality within the minimum possible time.    Simulation results indicate that solution quality and processing speeds are influenced by both solution methodology and degree of data complexity. When the structure of either factor is simplified, solutions are generated more rapidly-but with an accompanying reduction in solution quality. A promising compromise that combines DP techniques with mathematical functions based on a subset of the original data is presented.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">OPERATIONS RESEARCH (0796)</field><field name="subject">AGRICULTURE, WOOD TECHNOLOGY (0746)</field><field name="subject">ENGINEERING, SYSTEM SCIENCE (0790)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/73</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The enhancement of intra-operative diagnostics and decision-making using computational methods</field><field name="creator">Harrison, Michael J</field><field name="description">The data presented and views expressed in this document are the result of multiple published and unpublished studies over the last 25 years. My over-arching goal in this research was to use modern computing power to create functionally useful diagnoses, in real time, from the monitoring systems used during routine anaesthesia and to present these diagnoses in an ergonomic manner. In addition it was intended to incorporate into the anaesthetic monitor, expert systems that help with the management of uncommon situations. The Australian and New Zealand College guidelines on monitoring during anaesthesia dictate those measurements that should be made during every anaesthetic; from these data evidence can be gathered, integrated, and presented to the clinician. Constraints in this field of research include the inability of the monitors to see, hear or understand the context of operating theatre activities, and computer processing time. Because many studies are involved the methods are detailed in the main text, and are not summarized here. Physiological 'envelopes' have been developed, in which the 'normal' variation in physiological variables, during anaesthesia, are enclosed. They have enabled the creation of intelligent alarm systems that can suggest diagnoses. A retrospective off-line study showed that it was possible to diagnose the onset of malignant hyperpyrexia, using fuzzy logic templates, about 10minutes earlier than the clinician. Some variables may be more important than others in making a diagnosis, and the strength of a diagnosis depends on the amount of supporting evidence, the amount of evidence not against the diagnosis and the amount of missing data. Decision-making (for example to transfuse or not transfuse blood) can also be mathematically modelled so that decision making is more consistent. Finally, investigation of the ways of displaying data indicates that the output can be very explicit. My overall conclusion is that real time decision support systems for the management of clinical dilemmas are possible. They can be instantly and easily accessible and can sit discretely in the background of anaesthetic monitors to be activated at will by the anaesthetist.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Health Sciences, Medicine and Surgery (0564)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/74</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Finding the relationship that justifies egoistic concern</field><field name="creator">Weideli, Wendy Anne</field><field name="description">This thesis is a quest to find the relationship that justifies egoistic concern. I point out that what we are inclined to believe about the justification of egoistic concern, let's call it the Old Theory, is that personal identity is the relationship that justifies egoistic concern, that personal identity involves a deep further fact, and that physical and psychological continuity are good evidence for personal identity.    I argue that, if personal identity involves the deep further fact, then physical and psychological continuity are not good evidence for personal identity and thus the Old Theory is mistaken. Furthermore, if the everyday egoistic concern that we have for a person who is physically and psychologically continuous with us is clearly rational, then physical and psychological continuity must be good evidence for the relationship that justifies egoistic concern, and thus either personal identity is not the relationship that justifies egoistic concern, or personal identity does not involve the deep further fact. Therefore, I suggest that a new theory about the justification of egoistic concern should have the following structure; some relationship, let's call it E, is the relationship that justifies egoistic concern, E does not involve the deep further fact, and physical and psychological continuity are good evidence for E.    I then point out that a new theory about the justification of egoistic concern should take into account the dominant intuitions that the Old Theory was based on, but should ignore intuitions that are based solely on mistaken beliefs flowing from the Old Theory. I argue that it is not easy to separate these two types of intuitions, but, nevertheless, in trying to find E I attempt to capture the intuitions that underlie the Old Theory, while avoiding the use of methods that might capture intuitions that are based solely on mistaken beliefs involved in the Old Theory.    After considering the various candidates for E, I conclude that psychological continuity, even if it occurs coincidentally, is the relationship that justifies egoistic concern.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">PHILOSOPHY (0422)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/75</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Tupulaga Tokelau in New Zealand (the Tokelau younger generation in New Zealand)</field><field name="creator">Green, Valerie Joyce</field><field name="description">Tokelauans initiated a contemporary migration from their relatively remote Pacific atolls to New Zealand around 1960 and this population movement was assisted by government resettlement schemes. The broad objectives of the ethnographic research contributing to this thesis were to study the historical context of this small-scale voluntary migration, the establishment and social organisation of culturally distinguished urban communities in North Island centres, and post-resettlement outcomes experienced by migrant and descent populations. Each of the two studies incorporated in the thesis is primarily concerned with t&#363;pulaga &#8216;the younger generation&#8217; in the New Zealand Tokelau population. One is community-based and focused on the social interactions of generation cohorts of t&#363;pulaga  and tupuna &#8216;elders&#8217;, the formal community associations and the national association of affiliated t&#363;pulaga  groups. The other is concerned with bunches of &#8220;detached&#8221; t&#363;pulaga geographically scattered throughout the country, the people without voices when research includes only the migrants in urban enclaves. Background considerations include overviews of theoretical approaches to studying the population phenomenon of migration; relevant aspects of Tokelau history and the movement of Pacific peoples; New Zealand as the receiving country and continuously changing social context for Tokelau communities, and a conceptual framework derived from features of complex adaptive systems theories that was helpful in considering aspects of the contemporary migration and its outcomes. T&#363;pulaga leaders, through the association of affiliated groups known as the Mafutaga, revived the pre-eminent cultural principle  maopoopo &#8216;gathered together and unified&#8217;, promoted a vision of &#8216;Tokelau ways in New Zealand&#8217; and supported t&#363;pulaga &#8220;becoming Tokelau in New Zealand&#8221; as residents of urban communities. Over a number of years, Mafutaga officials led the expansion of t&#363;pulaga inter-community sports meetings into a four-day national gathering of Tokelauans now celebrated as an unequivocal expression of Tokelau culture in New Zealand, and guided the established urban communities through a transition from migrant to cultural communities without usurping the political roles of esteemed elders.    The second study shows that intergenerational issues were pivotal or contributory in most t&#363;pulaga decisions to &#8220;detach&#8221; from community networks and activities. &#8220;Detachment&#8221; is categorised as transient (a provisional, not necessarily long-term status), tacit (a restorative withdrawal, with subsequent reattachment) or diuternal (a considered choice and enduring status).</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ANTHROPOLOGY, CULTURAL (0326)</field><field name="subject">SOCIOLOGY, ETHNIC AND RACIAL STUDIES (0631)</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420300 Cultural Studies::420307 Pacific cultural studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/76</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Non-invasive electrical imaging of the heart</field><field name="creator">Cheng, Leo K</field><field name="description">Non-invasive electrical imaging of the heart aims to quantitatively reconstruct information about the electrical activity of the heart from multiple thoracic ECG signals. The computational framework required to produce such electrical images of the heart from non-invasive torso surface signals is presented. It is shown reliable electrical images of the heart can be obtained under a controlled environment. This has been demonstrated using an anatomically realistic boundary element porcine torso model. The procedures required to create a subject specific model using a small number of control points and to create a specific heart model from three-dimensional ultrasound images using a linear fitting procedure are presented. From discrete ECG electrodes a continuous representation of the potential field over the entire torso surface can also be produced using this linear fitting procedure. The construction of the transfer matrices for the two predominant electrocardiographic sources (epicardial potentials and myocardial activation times) are described in detail. The transfer matrices are used to compute activation times within the heart and epicardial potentials on the heart surface. Myocardial activation times are computed using an algorithm based on the Critical Point Theorem while epicardial potentials are computed using standard Tikhonov and Truncated SVD spatially regularised methods as well as Greensite's spatial and temporal regularisation method. The regularisation parameters for the epicardial potentials are determined using a variety of methods (e.g., CRESO criterion, L-curve, zero-crossing). The potential and activation based formulations are compared in a comprehensive inverse simulation study. To try and capture the dynamic and variable nature of cardiac electrical activity, the study is performed with three different types of cardiac sources with a realistic porcine model. These simulations investigate the effect on the computed solutions of individual and combinations of modelling errors. These errors include corruption in the torso surface signals, changes in material properties and geometric distortion. In general, the activation based formulation is preferred over the epicardial potential formulations, with Greensite's method found to be the best method for reconstructing epicardial potentials. Under optimal conditions, the activation approach could reconstruct the activation times to within RMS. Both potential and activation based formulations were found to be relatively insensitive to changes in material properties such as lung conductivities and activation function shapes. When examining individual errors, the geometry and positions of the torso and heart had the greatest effects on the inverse solutions. The relative heart position needed to be determined to within to obtain results within of the solutions obtained under control conditions. When the modelling errors are combined to produce errors which can be expected in a clinical or experimental situation the activation based solutions were consistently more accurate than potential based solutions. The next necessary step in this project is the detailed validation of the results against in-vivo data. This step is necessary before such algorithms can be reliably used to aid in the assessment of heart function in a clinical environment.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Heart imaging;Electrocardiography;Heart Electric properties</field><field name="subject">Engineering, Biomedical (0541)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/77</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Interest-based planning: The concept of interest and public urban land use system planning</field><field name="creator">Hall, Derek Rotherham</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the possibility of applying the concept of interest to public urban land use system planning, although it is not intended that the idea should be limited to urban planning.    The concept is considered in detail, as is the question of who can have interests. The conclusion on that is that individuals and the public are the only true categories of interest holders, although interest groups need to be recognised for practical reasons. Corporations and governments cannot be true interest holders.    The application of the concept was assessed in relation to the subject-matter of urban land use planning, and a typical land use planning process. The possibility of applying it to a hypothetical system of planning using the pragmatic method was also considered.    The final part looked at the &#8216;institutions&#8217; of planning, that is, law, politics, professional planning, administration, and administrative tribunals, to see how they would likely relate to a planning system based on the use of the concept of interest. The conclusion was that there would be no insurmountable difficulties even If not all of these institutions would readily embrace the concept.    The idea was found to be plausible in so far as a comprehensive theory of interest-based urban land use planning was able to be worked out. By considering practical issues throughout, a strong presumption was raised that it would be feasible, although testing and further development of the idea would be necessary.    Finally, the advantages and disadvantages of the proposed method were reviewed. The expected benefits were ensuring that public urban land use system planning was humanistic, and providing a concept, or theme, around which a comprehensive theory of such planning could be constructed. Likely areas of difficulty were misunderstanding due to the lack of agreement on the meaning of the concept, although the meaning that should be adopted for the proposed purpose was spelt out. Secondly, a conservative attitude towards the use of concepts other than interest in planning and related disciplines could cause resistance to the adoption of the proposed method.    It was shown how the idea is largely novel, but that recently there has been increasing use of the concept of interest in the land use planning literature.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">URBAN AND REGIONAL PLANNING (0999)</field><field name="subject">PHILOSOPHY (0422)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/78</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Globalisation and translation:  Towards a paradigm shift in translation studies</field><field name="creator">Ho, George</field><field name="description">Guided by Thomas Kuhn's theory about paradigm shift advanced in  The Structure of Scientific Revolutions and Mao Tsetung's theory of &#8220;the new superseding the old&#8221;, this thesis briefly examines the history of translation both in the West and in China and observes three paradigm shifts in each territory. The analyses reveal that paradigm shifts in translation theory occur when the changes in the social, economic, cultural and religious environments lead to significant changes in the practice of translation and that these changes then can no longer be adequately theorised by the old paradigms of translation. This study then critically reviews current literature on globalisation and translation and attributes its lack of depth in theorisation or some of its misleading predictions to certain scholars' inadequate investigation of the phenomenon of globalisation.    In order to provide an adequate interpretation, description, explanation and prediction of the impact of globalisation on the theory and practice of translation, I investigate five aspects of globalisation and their respective impact on translation practice and find that globalisation has changed the mainstream of translation practice from canonical translation to professional (i.e., non-canonical) translation. The findings of the research demonstrate that traditional translation theories based on comparative literary study or on linguistics fail to provide an objective and comprehensive theoretical framework for the mainstream practice of translation. Therefore, it is justifiable to posit a paradigm shift in Translation Studies from canonical translation to professional translation so as to meet the demand of and challenges for the translation profession and business under the impact of globalisation. As an initiation towards the establishment of a new paradigm, I posit a &#8220;value-driven&#8221; theory based on recent developments in researches on the global economy to distinguish between canonical and professional translations. Influenced by theories of the knowledge-driven economy, I further propose to establish a force of translators as knowledge workers to better serve the demand of the global economy and the global community. To follow the principle of empiricism, I use several case studies from the real world of commercial translation to support my &#8220;value-driven&#8221; theory for Translation Studies.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">LANGUAGE, GENERAL (0679)</field><field name="subject">BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION, MARKETING (0338)</field><field name="subject">LANGUAGE, RHETORIC AND COMPOSITION (0681)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/80</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Private speech : a window in the self-talk of kindergarten children from diverse language background</field><field name="creator">Clark, Beverley</field><field name="description">The immense potential of language, for learning, building relationships, as the embodiment of culture, for an understanding of the world and for expressing 'self', is the underlying theme of this thesis. One less apparent aspect of the language of children is their private speech. In this thesis the research questions focus on whether children from diverse language backgrounds attending English-speaking kindergartens use private speech. Further, if so, what is the context, who is present when it is used and is there a response from the person or people? These questions are primarily addressed through observations of eight children as well as recordings of their private speech. An understanding of the context is supported through interviews with the parents and teachers in the kindergartens. The expectations for this research were largely based on the work of Vygotsky, and adapted to the natural, 'free play' environments of the kindergartens. It was expected that children from diverse language backgrounds in English medium kindergartens would use private speech in their own language. While the children did use private speech (unlike the results from Vygotsky's research) they talked to themselves in English using the language that they had acquired from the community, from the media, from their experiences at kindergarten and in some cases from their families. Based on Krafft &amp; Berk's categories of private speech, a significant focus of this research is the categories of private speech that were used by individual children. These findings pose interesting insight into the experiences of the children. This research has shown the child's remarkable ability to tune into the language and culture of context and to do so not only in relation to the socio-cultural context but also through thinking and acting. This study has also provided insight into the early childhood environments and the experiences of the teachers. As the first known research into private speech/self-talk in early childhood in Aotearoa New Zealand it can serve as a spring-board for further research to enhance our understanding of the child's thinking and learning through private speech.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/81</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The religious mind:  An evolutionary argument for theological non-realism</field><field name="creator">Walker, Ruth Marianne Donovan</field><field name="description">The debate between theological realists and non-realists has so far resisted resolution. In this thesis I apply the insights of current best theory in evolutionary psychology to the problem of deciding between theological realism, which holds that religious beliefs are about some aspect of mind-independent reality, and theological non-realism, which holds that religious beliefs are mind-dependent only. The most well-known exponent of theological non-realism is Don Cupitt who bases his approach to the problem on a combination of biological naturalism and culturalism. In the first part of this thesis I show that biological naturalism and culturalism are incompatible and that culturalism should be rejected in favor of biological naturalism. Cupitt's biological naturalism is the forerunner of an evolutionary psychological approach to religious beliefs that holds great promise for determining their correct interpretation. In the second part of this thesis I critically examine the foundations of evolutionary psychology and its subsequent development into an approach to religious belief in particular.    Current evolutionary theories of culture, including religious belief, use Meme theory, which seems, on the face of it, to be a theory analogous to that of natural selection. I show that the memetic approach to religious belief is mistaken but that there is a sound alternative in the work of Pascal Boyer. Boyer draws on evolutionary psychology, anthropology and cognitive science to develop an account of the origin in the mind of religious beliefs and their spread through the population.    My evolutionary argument is that religious beliefs are the result of the current but not proper function of cognitive modules. Only if beliefs are the result of the proper function of cognitive modules are we justified in holding them to be about some aspect of mind-independent reality. Theological realism is blocked because all versions of realism in the literature depend to some degree on the fact of religious experience, which is covered by the evolutionary argument. Theological non-realism is supported, in principle, by the evolutionary argument but, in practice, is not a genuine alternative to realism because religious beliefs are automatically given a realist interpretation that competes with explicit nonrealist interpretations.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">PHILOSOPHY (0422)</field><field name="subject">RELIGION, PHILOSOPHY OF (0322)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/82</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The influence of individualist and collectivist attributes on responses to Likert-type scales</field><field name="creator">Shulruf, Boaz</field><field name="description">Collectivism and individualism are culturally-related psychological structures which have been used to distinguish people within and across various societies. From a review of the literature, it is argued that the most salient feature of individualism is valuing personal independence, which includes self-knowledge, uniqueness, privacy, clear communication, and competitiveness. Collectivism is associated with a strong sense of duty to group, relatedness to others, seeking others' advice, harmony, and working with the group. The purpose of the thesis is to explore how collectivist and individualist attributes affect the way people respond to Likert-type questionnaires.    In the first study, a new measurement tool for individualism and collectivism was developed to address critical methodological issues in this field of cross-cultural psychology. This new measure the &#8220;Auckland Individualism and Collectivism Scale&#8221; defined three dimensions of individualism: (a) Responsibility (acknowledging one's responsibility for one's actions), (b) Uniqueness (distinction of the self from the other) and (c) Compete (striving for personal goals is one's prime interest); and two dimensions of collectivism: (d) Advice (seeking advice from people close to one, before taking decisions), and (e) Harmony (seeking to avoid conflict). The AICS avoids the need for measuring horizontal and vertical dimensions of collectivism and individualism, and the confounding effect of familialism on the collectivism-individualism constructs.    The second study investigated the relationship between collectivism and individualism and various response sets that have been reported relating to the way in which individuals respond to Likert-type scales. Using structural equation modelling, the Collectivism-Individualism Model of Response Bias was developed. This model suggests two types of response sets: (a) the Impression-Response Bias which includes response sets such as social desirability and context, that affect the first four stages of responding to questions, namely receiving and retrieving data and making decisions; and (b) the Expression-Response Bias which includes response sets such as the extreme response set and the neutral response set that relate to the application of the responses, namely the actual answer chosen by the respondent. Collectivism is negatively correlated with context and with self deception enhancement whereas individualism is positively correlated with context and self deception enhancement and impression management. Context is positively correlated with extreme response set and negatively correlated with neutral response set. The Collectivism-Individualism Model of Response Bias suggests that collectivist and individualist attributes directly affect the Impression-Response Bias response sets and indirectly affect the Expression-Response Bias response sets. It was concluded that attributes of collectivism and individualism affect the decision made by the respondents and therefore lead to different responses to Likert-type questionnaires. Nevertheless, the effect of collectivism and individualism on the magnitude of the responses would be limited as it is mediated by the Impression-Response Bias response set.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">PSYCHOLOGY, SOCIAL (0451)</field><field name="subject">PSYCHOLOGY, PSYCHOMETRICS (0632)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/83</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mechanics and material properties of the heart using an anatomically accurate mathematical model</field><field name="creator">Nash, Martyn</field><field name="description">Global and regional mechanics of the cardiac ventricles were investigated using an anatomicallyaccurate computational model formulated from concise mathematical descriptions ofthe left and right ventricular wall geometries and the non-homogeneous laminar microstructureof cardiac muscle. The finite element method for finite deformation elasticity was developedfor the analysis and included specialised coordinate systems, interpolation schemesand parallel processing techniques for greater computational efficiency.The ventricular mechanics model incorporated the fully orthotropic pole-zero constitutivelaw, based on the three-dimensional architecture of myocardium, to account for the nonlinearmaterial response of resting cardiac muscle, relative to the three anatomically relevant axes.A fibre distribution model was introduced to reconcile some of the pole-zero constitutiveparameters with direct mechanical properties of the tissue (such as the limiting strainsestimated from detailed physiological observations of the collagen helices that surroundmyofibres), whilst other parameters were estimated from in-vitro biaxial tension tests onthin sections of myocardium. A non-invasive approach to in-vivo myocardial materialparameter estimation was also developed, based on a magnetic resonance imaging techniqueto effectively tag ventricular wall tissue.The spatially non-homogeneous distribution of myocardial residual strain was accounted forin the ventricular mechanics model using a specialised growth tensor. A simple model of fluidshift was formulated to account for the changes in local tissue volume due to movement ofintramyocardial blood. Contractile properties of ventricular myofibres were approximatedusing a quasi-static relationship between the fibre extension ratio, intracellular calciumconcentration and active fibre stress, and the framework has been developed to include amore realistic model of active myocardial mechanics, which could be coupled to a realisticdescription of the time-varying spread of electrical excitation throughout the ventricularwalls. Simple volumetric cavity models were incorporated to investigate the effects of arterialimpedance on systolic wall mechanics.Ventricular mechanics model predictions of the cavity pressure versus volume relationships,longitudinal dimension changes, torsional wall deformations and regional distributions ofmyocardial strain during the diastolic filling, isovolumic contraction and ejection phasesof the cardiac cycle showed good overall agreement with reported observations derivedfrom experimental studies of isolated and in-vivo canine hearts.

In particular, it offers a useful addition to more established techniques for dating speleothems, which not only have relevance to Quaternary geomorphology but may also carry palaeomagnetic and palaeoclimatic data. This work consolidates the method of ESR dating, with special reference to calcite speleothems, and contributes to several important aspects of the methodology. Using a low energy nuclear accelerator as a source of alpha particles of various energies, it is shown that the effectiveness of alpha radiation in producing paramagnetic defects is energy dependent, and approximately linearly related to the range of the incident alpha; the implications for dose rate calculations are discussed, and ranges are calculated for alpha particles of different energies for various dating materials for use in applying the above finding. The alpha/gamma effectiveness ratio, k, is experimentally determined for 18 calcite speleothems as k$/sb[/rm av]$ = 0.052 $/pm$ 0.006, which is significantly less than most previous estimates. The k-value for a coral sample is 0.055. By examining the Th-230/Po-210 ratios of 19 speleothem samples it is shown that for almost all speleothems, radon is retained within the sample until its decay; thus the full radionuclide decay chains should be used in dose rate calculations. Analysis of 'typical' calcite spectra confirms that interference between peaks of different origins and stability affects the estimate of accumulated dose (AD), and provides a rational basis for decisions on different sample preparation methods and analytical procedures. The effect of these on age estimates is examined and routine experimental methods recommended. The effect of different ESR spectrometer operating parameters is also evaluated and it is shown that the use of high microwave power avoids potentially serious underestimation of the accumulated dose (AD). A straight-forward statistical method is developed; this enables confidence limits to be derived for AD and provides a test for equivalence of AD estimates, using standard linear hypothesis techniques. A robust Geiger Muller instrument sufficiently sensitive to give estimates of relative gamma dose rates in a few minutes is developed specifically for cave dosimetry. It has the potential, with further development and cross-calibration, to become a viable method for measuring absolute environmental gamma dose rates. Serious discrepancies between two 'absolute' dosimetry methods are revealed; this and other problems of environmental gamma dosimetry are discussed. The evaluation of gamma dose rates in calcite (with respect to both laboratory and field dosimetry) and the form of the dose response curve (including the possibility of supra-linearity and non-thermal instability) are identified as areas requiring further research.</field><field name="date">1990</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY (0368)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/85</field></doc><doc><field name="title">From species to languages : a phylogenetic approach to human prehistory</field><field name="creator">Atkinson, Quentin Douglas</field><field name="description">Languages, like species, evolve. Just like biologists, historical linguists infer relationships between the lineages they study by analysing heritable features. For linguists, these features can be words, grammar and phonemes. This linguistic evidence of descent with modification plays an important role in our understanding of human prehistory. However, conventional methods in historical linguistics do not employ an explicit optimality criterion to evaluate evolutionary language trees. These methods cannot quantify uncertainty in the inferences nor provide an absolute chronology of divergence events. Previous attempts to estimate divergence times from lexical data using glottochronological methods have been heavily criticized, particularly for the assumption of constant rates of lexical replacement. Computational phylogenetic methods from biology can overcome these problems and allow divergence times to be estimated without the assumption of constant rates. Here these methods are applied to lexical data to test hypotheses about human prehistory. First, divergence time estimates for the age of the Indo-European language family are used to test between two competing theories of Indo- European origin - the Kurgan hypothesis and the Anatolian farming hypothesis. The resulting age estimates are consistent with the age range implied by the Anatolian farming theory. Validation exercises using different models, data sets and coding procedures, as well as the analysis of synthetic data, indicate these results are highly robust. Second, the same methodology was applied to Mayan lexical data to infer historical relationships and divergence times within the Mayan language family. The results highlight interesting uncertainties in Mayan language relationships and suggest that the family may be older than previously thought. Finally, returning to biology, similar tree-building and model validation techniques are used to draw inferences about human origins and dispersal from human mitochondrial DNA sequence data. These analyses support a human origin 150,000-250,000 years ago and reveal time dependency in rates of mitochondrial DNA evolution. Population size estimates generated using a coalescent approach suggest a twophase human population expansion from Africa. Potential correlations between human genetic and linguistic diversity are highlighted. I conclude that there is much to be gained by linguists and biologists using the same methods and speaking the same language.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Psychology, General (0621)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/86</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Aspiring for unity and equality : dynamics of conflict and change in the 'by women for women' feminist service groups, Aotearoa/New Zealand (1970-1999)</field><field name="creator">Vanderpyl, Jane</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the emergence and subsequent development of feminist activist service groups in Aotearoa/New Zealand feminist movements from the 1970s to the 1990s. It specifically considers, the Women's Centres, Women's Health Collectives, Women's Refuges and Rape Crisis groups. Feminism in the groups was closely linked to the internal processes of organising as a collective based on 'women's ways of working'. The groups merged a radical feminist political orientation with a service orientation as they developed services 'for women by women'. The study was based on a qualitative analysis of published and unpublished documents of activist service groups, and open-ended interviews with 65 women discussing their experiences of working in activist service groups. Two distinct phases of change to the internal organisation of the groups between 1970 and 1999 have been identified and examined. In the first phase, (1970s - 1980s), radical feminist collective ways of working acquired the status of a taken for granted institutional norm among the groups. These groups organised as women-only collectives, utilised consensus decision-making, embodied ideals of non-hierarchy, and had aspirations of sisterhood between women. The second phase (from the late 1980s) was marked by modification of the radical feminist collective, as groups experienced internal and external pressures to adopt bureaucratic practices. Major pressures included the shift by the state to contract funding of the groups, the changing participation of paid and unpaid workers in the daily work of the groups, and the increasing formal differentiation between employers and employees. These changes were a major source of conflict and tension, as the groups modified their organisations to include differentiation of roles, specialisation of positions and formal hierarchy. At the same time groups sustained aspects of radical feminist collective organising. Dealing with differences was a major site of tension and conflict in the activist service groups. Groups implemented various strategies to address differences between women in relation to race/ethnicity, sexuality and class. A major focus of the groups was the development of bicultural relations between M&#257;ori and non-M&#257;ori. Models of biculturalrelations in the predominantly P&#257;keh&#257; groups ranged from increasing M&#257;ori representation in the groups, to the formation of alliances between independent groups or alliances between ethnic-specific groups in the same organisation. These strategies were mostly framed in terms of a binary opposition between oppressed and oppressor, and along a single axis of oppression. Nevertheless, the groups' attempts to 'deal with differences' between women were important in challenging assumptions of genderbased commonality between all women. In spite of these conflicts and associated changes, participants in the activist service groups attempted to maintain inclusive, non-hierarchical, empowering organisations 'for women by women'. In the 1990s, many of the feminist activist service groups continued to pursue democratic collective ways of working and to engage in a politics of difference in their organisations.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Women's Studies (0453)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/87</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Older adulthood, education and social change (Australia, New Zealand)</field><field name="creator">Martin, Allan</field><field name="description">The outcome of demographics which point to a rapid increase in the number of older adults in the population has been widely debated in the literature. However, it has been examined primarily from the perspective of an unrealistically optimistic or unduly pessimistic view of the future, with few attempts to provide other alternatives.    This thesis is structured in three sections. The first backgrounds the context of the research question, the relevant literature, the prospect of gender bias in that literature and the historical development of government policy towards ageing. The second section presents a theoretical perspective for social change, examines the development of social movements and puts a case for a new social movement arising out of the increasing number of older adults and supporting educative processes. The third section reports on empirical research based on interviews in Australia and New Zealand with leaders of organisations involved with older adults and focuses on drawing conclusions from the research in relation to the research question.    The theory proposed in this thesis is based on the premise that an opportune time in history exists for older adults to contribute to social and political change. However, for senior members of society to undertake this role will require education in some form, to act as an agency or catalyst to initiate an organised social movement. Findings of this research support the view that the majority of older adults remain fit and healthy and do not conform to the medicalisation approach to ageing on which government policy and, to a large extent, public attitudes, have been formed. While there would be problems of organisation in the formation of a new social movement there are no insurmountable obstacles to overcome. The greatest difficulty would seem to lie in overcoming inertia, sectional interests, generating the leadership and developing innovative and imaginative educative processes.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/88</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The 'Jesus nut':  A study of New Zealand military chaplaincy</field><field name="creator">Tagg, Mary Alison</field><field name="description">Since the earliest days of the Christian Church, ordained ministers and priests have accompanied soldiers into battle. The religious presence in the war machine has been the subject of many debates, particularly those involving the conflict of ethics presented by the representation of a gospel of peace and love participating in a profession of violence and killing.    New Zealand is a secular country with a relatively well-developed system of secular pastoral care services. However the New Zealand Defence Force continues to request the churches' involvement in the military and those churches which respond continue to participate in work which appears contrary to their teaching. This study examines the relationship of church and military. It investigates the place of the church in the New Zealand Defence Force through an examination of the appropriate literature and other relevant information, and an empirical survey of the work and views of current, and some retired, chaplains.    The global military scenario has changed in recent years with the development of war technology. The New Zealand military focus is now largely directed towards policing New Zealand's economic zone and the preservation of independence of smaller neighbouring island states, while its active service role is one of participation in international peace-enforcement and peacekeeping. This thesis considers these changes and looks at the possible effects they may have on the future of military chaplaincy within the secular, multicultural context of the New Zealand state. The study concludes with a rationale for the presence of the Christian Church in the New Zealand Defense Force and presents issues which the current chaplaincy-providing churches need to consider if they wish to continue to provide effective chaplaincy for the military.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">RELIGION, CLERGY (0319)</field><field name="subject">THEOLOGY (0469)</field><field name="subject">HISTORY, CHURCH (0330)</field><field name="subject">EDUCATION, GUIDANCE AND COUNSELING (0519)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/89</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The New Zealand Greywackes:  A study of geological concepts in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Nicholson, Heather Halcrow</field><field name="description">This thesis traces changes in geological concepts associated with the New Zealand greywackes. Since mineralogists adopted the German mining term 'grauwacke' in the 1780s to refer to a type of old, hard, grey, muddy sandstone, both the name and the rock have caused confusion and controversy. English geologists in the 1830s used the term 'grauwacke' as a rock name and a formation name for their most ancient rocks. The English abandoned the name, but 'greywacke' remained useful in Scotland and began to be used in New Zealand in the 1890s. New Zealanders still refer to the association of semi-metamorphosed greywacke sandstones, argillites, minor lavas, cherts and limestone constituting the North Island ranges and the Southern Alps as 'the greywackes'. With the South Island schists, the greywackes make up 27% of the surface of the New Zealand landmass. They supply much of our road metal, but otherwise have little economic importance. Work on these basement rocks has rarely exceeded 10% of geological research in New Zealand.Leading geologists of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries competed to construct stratigraphical models for New Zealand where the greywackes were usually classified as of Paleozoic age. Controversy was generated by insufficient data, field mistakes, wrong fossil identifications, attachment to ruling theories and the inability of European-based conventional stratigraphical methodologies to deal with these Carboniferous to Jurassic rocks formed in a very different and unsuspected geological environment. After 1945, growth of the universities, increased Geological Survey activity, and the acquisition of more reliable data led to fresh explanatory ideas about geosynclines, turbidity currents, depositional facies, low-grade metamorphism, and structural geology. New interest in the greywackes resulted in the accumulation of additional knowledge about their paleontology, petrography, sedimentology and structure. Much of this geological data is stored in visual materials including maps, photographs, and diagrams and these are essential today for the interpretation and transfer of information.The development of plate tectonic theory and the accompanying terrane concept in the seventies and eighties permitted real progress in understanding the oceanic origin of greywackes within submarine accretionary prisms and their transport to the New Zealand region. In the last half century comparatively little geological controversy about the greywackes has taken place because of the acquisition of quantities of data, technological improvements, and the use of a dependable theory of the Earth's crust. Scientific controversy takes place when data and/or background theory is inadequate.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Geology (0372)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/90</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The epidemiology and clinical pathophysiology of thromboembolic disease</field><field name="creator">Egermayer, Paul Charles</field><field name="description">Thrombosis is a vascular pathological process which frequently affects the veins of the lower limbs, and embolisation of thrombotic material is common. Thromboembolic disease is a common cause of death in Western societies, predominantly affecting the elderly. Numerous risk factors and co-morbidities have been identified. Safe and effective means of prophylaxis are available but are underutilised.    Anticoagulant drugs are very effective in preventing thromboembolic disease, but their effects on the evolution of the thrombotic process remain poorly documented. These drugs are difficult to use, and treatment errors and treatment failures are common.    The factors which determine the embolisation of deep vein thrombosis are poorly understood. When such embolisation occurs it is usually asymptomatic. Symptomatic pulmonary embolism presents in 3 general ways-pleuritic pain, shortness of breath, or collapse. Tachypnea is the commonest sign.    Tests which are available to assist in the diagnosis of thromboembolic disease include the ventilation perfusion lung scan, ultrasound of the lower limbs, pulmonary angiography and echocardiography. The commonest investigation requested in this context is the lung scan. Although the results are often inconclusive, this is frequently the only specific investigation which is performed. The accurate interpretation of lung scans requires consideration of the pretest probability of pulmonary embolism. The D-dimer assay is another test which may be useful. The finding of a normal D-dimer level substantially reduces the probability of thromboembolic disease and may render a lung scan unnecessary.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">HEALTH SCIENCES, MEDICINE AND SURGERY (0564)</field><field name="subject">HEALTH SCIENCES, PATHOLOGY (0571)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/91</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The mechanism of death evoked by human amylin in pancreatic islet B cells</field><field name="creator">Bai, Ji Zhong</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.

The system, which is thought to have been active for at least 200,000 years, is situated over an area which has been volcanically active through time. Relatively recent local magmatism is found in the 800 m high, 3000-10,000 year old Mt. Edgecumbe dacite massif and the 200 m high Onepu Dome complex which lie adjacent to and within, respectively, the present day resistivity anomaly.    Shallow reservoir fluids show evidence of steam heating as expressed by elevated bicarbonate and/or sulphate contents and mildly to strongly acidic pH, whereas the deep fluids are dominantly alkaline at their respective temperatures. The calculated base fluid composition is comprised of 2.5 wt% CO$/sb2$ and ca. 890 mg/kg Cl at 310$/sp/circ$C.    Fluid inclusion studies show a largely stable, boiling point thermal regime through time, whereas oxygen stable isotope studies on hydrothermal carbonates prove the existence of one or more pulses of isotopically heavy fluids into the reservoir at some time(s) in the past. Hydrothermal alteration associated with these isotopic anomalies indicate strongly oxidising conditions relative to both alteration elsewhere in the reservoir and the present day reservoir redox conditions. Collectively, the data suggest a magmatic source for these transient, isotopically heavy fluids.    The present day system is ore forming, as evident from both metal rich scales formed in the production silencers of the geothermal wells and open fracture reservoir mineralogy. Stockwork environments in the deep reservoir are host to both base and precious metals, and evidence indicates that boiling is the main depositional mechanism for these ore phases.</field><field name="date">1987</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">GEOCHEMISTRY (0996)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/94</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Human recombinant galectin-1 as a potential growth modulator</field><field name="creator">Weinberg, Cristina Simona</field><field name="description">Human galectin-1 is a soluble form of lectin known to play a role in various cellular processes by mediating recognition events in which glycoconjugates are implicated. As a number of studies have shown that galectin-1 is a growth inhibitor (Wells and Mallucci, 1991; Manilal et al., 1993), the starting hypothesis for this thesis was that galectin-1 might be a substrate for a growth-related proteinase (GRP). The intention was to identify the mechanism of action responsible for this growth-inhibitory property by looking at the effect of galectin treatment on the expression of the c-fos proto-oncogene.    The structure of the recombinant galectin-1 molecule was investigated in mass spectrometry determinations. Galectin-1 was further characterised in hemagglutination, cellular growth, cytotoxicity, proteolysis and cellular degradation experiments. Even though the recombinant galectin-1 was not identical with the natural protein because it contained two pGEX-linker amino acid residues, and had an apparently 933 Da bigger molecular weight, it fully retained the carbohydrate binding and mitogenicity properties and was still a biphasic growth modulator.    Repeated DNA sequencing and mass spectrometry determinations of the tryptic peptides have accounted for all the galectin molecule and have not detected an insertion. We concluded that the abnormal size was the result of a calibration error in the mass spectrometer.    Even though the recombinant galectin was proved to be very susceptible to soluble proteinase action, there was no evidence for its active degradation when incubated with cells, and this disproved the original hypothesis.    We showed for the first time that $/alpha/sb1$-antitrypsin inhibitor (which inhibits the GRP) had a down-regulatory effect on c-fos expression. Galectin-1 treatment of U2OS and HELA cells had a downregulatory effect on c-fos expression, which confirmed the hypothesis that this proto-oncogene is affected by the signal transduction pathway through which galectin-1 inhibits cell growth. C-fos expression is affected in HELA cells even though they do not undergo growth inhibition, indicating that this process is not as simple as we initially believed. Galectin-1 treatment also downregulated galectin-1 gene expression. This meant that feedback inhibition could take place in these tumour cells.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">BIOLOGY, MOLECULAR (0307)</field><field name="subject">BIOLOGY, CELL (0379)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/96</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Rap Music in Aotearoa: A Sociological and Musicological Analysis</field><field name="creator">Zemke-White, Kirsten</field><field name="description">This thesis examines rap music in Aotearoa, demonstrates its popularity, and explores its presence as a cultural commodity, particularly among Polynesian youth. I show how analysis of a popular musical phenomenon can be used to illustrate other social facts such as identity, political awareness, and alliance. American rap's history, musical characteristics, misogyny, profanity, racial implications, associations with deviance, and nihilism are explored, outlining multiple levels of meaning and intention, not excusing its occasional harshness, but presenting perspectives from within rap and critical race theory discourses. From interviews with school students, teachers, rappers, adults involved with young people and persons in the media industry, I show that, in Aotearoa, it is the Polynesian youth who have embraced rap, both as fans and as performers, from breakdancing in the early 80's to the latest surge of "Pasifika Hip Hop". Through observation and collection of videos, CD's, sales charts, magazines and news articles I conclude that American rap has had a strong presence in the media and popular music history of Aotearoa, with many local rap artists and songs having local chart successes. Through musical and lyrical analysis I summarise and compare the themes and musical influences of both American and Aotearoa rap and discover that Aotearoa rap is used to assert and construct local identities exploring race, culture and history. The thesis begs the question: Why is rap so popular particularly among Polynesian youth? Four responses are explored: a) The rappers themselves cite a similar socio-economic and historical circumstance to African Americans; b) Rap is a popular globalised popular cultural form, possibly representing a generalised trend in Americanisation and homogenisation, (which I refute on the basis of rap's inherent "blackness" arguing that hip hop is rather a voice of opposition); c) Rap as a genre has kaupapa [philosophy] and presents an ideal tool for the exigencies of Polynesian youth's exploration of identity and community and for the communication of political and pride; and finally d) The Polynesian youth of Aotearoa feel a spiritual connection to rap and hip hop, hearing something of themselves in it, and have taken to it like it was already theirs. I offer that rap has been a Turangawaewae [place to stand] for the rangatahi [youth] and they have injected this fertile African American popular music genre with their own culture and ideology.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sociology, Ethnic and Racial Studies (0631)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/97</field></doc><doc><field name="title">J.

A study (German text)</field><field name="creator">Meuser, Anneliese</field><field name="description">This study contains a detailed interpretation of the fragmentary play  Catharina von Siena by the Sturm-und-Drang (Storm and Stress) poet Jakob Michael Reinhold Lenz (1751-1792). Although we have only drafts of this play, the topic, the structure, and the relatively long time Lenz spent on the drama indicate that it was nevertheless an important work.    Over three chapters this study approaches the Catharina fragments in various ways, the main focus being on improving our understanding of the text. Before starting on the actual interpretation a few basic questions need to be examined, these relating to the conditions in which the play was created and developed, the choice of subject and themes, the manuscripts and their history, as well as the six editions of Catharina von Siena . For this reason the central interpretative chapter is prefaced by a chapter on the genesis of the play, as well as another chapter on the manuscripts and texts.    Since it was not possible to work with original manuscripts, a microfilm and reader print copies of the manuscripts were used. The textual examination was based on the readily available edition by Damm. Where necessary the reading by Titel/Haug and the older text editions by Weinhold, Lewy, Blei and Freye were used to supplement these, and also for the purpose of comparison.    A pluralistic methodological approach was applied. A more exact period of time for the creation of Catharina von Siena was defined, information about the way Lenz worked and about his intentions with regard to construction and effect was obtained as well. Through this detailed study of the fragments, correspondence and biographical data, we can establish reasons for the fragmentary character of the play, and are able to ascertain the special nature of the drama.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">LITERATURE, GERMANIC (0311)</field><field name="subject">THEATER (0465)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/98</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Globalisation, internationalisation and the knowledge economy in higher education: A case study of China and New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Jiang, Xiaoping (Isadora)</field><field name="description">This thesis analyses the contemporary phenomena of globalisation, the knowledge economy and internationalisation in terms of their synergistic impacts on higher education and with special reference to China and New Zealand. Globalisation and the knowledge economy are seen to fuel each other as well as driving trends in higher education. Internationalisation is shown to be intimately related to, but conceptually distinguishable from, globalisation, and to occur partly as a consequence of the latter (and of developments in the knowledge economy) but partly also as a response to these forces. All three phenomena are addressed through assessments of their dominant economic imperatives.    As a prerequisite to understanding and critiquing these forces and their dominant imperatives, the early chapters expound a further tripartite structure, this time of political-economic theories: neoliberalism, neo-Marxism, and Giddens' 'Third Way'. The lens through which the analysis is made is explicitly neo-Marxist. The thesis critiques the ascendancy of neoliberalism in the discourse of globalisation, and the knowledge economy and the internationalisation of higher education. Neoliberalism's ascendancy is shown to be promoted through global, regional, national and sub-national entities, and this promotion is found to be often covert.    The middle section of the thesis traces the effects on higher education of the economic, and specifically neoliberal or global-capitalist imperatives that the foregoing analysis reveals. Policies of deregulation, liberalisation, marketisation, privatisation and commercialisation are shown to exert largely negative influences on universities and, by extension, on other higher education institutions. They over-emphasise the private value of both knowledge itself and higher education as a knowledge agent, something which leads to a homogenising, devaluing 'commodification' of higher education. Having made the general case, the thesis then considers the Asia-Pacific region before focusing in depth on China and New Zealand. This structure makes for a macro-meso-micro approach to the development of the inquiry but with emphasis on the macro and the micro.    Key questions raised in the thesis concern the establishment of a 'counter-hegemony' to oppose the dominance of neoliberal principles and policies. The study culminates by recommending the emergent concept of interculturalism as both an accurate description of the intersection of cultures on campus and a desirable nonnative policy which should complement internationalisation as part of national and institutional response strategies. The thesis argues for the legitimation and encouragement of neo-Marxist interculturalisation and outlines its relevance to New Zealand higher education institutions, which host many international and new immigrant students, above all from China.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">EDUCATION, HIGHER (0745)</field><field name="subject">ECONOMICS, GENERAL (0501)</field><field name="subject">POLITICAL SCIENCE, GENERAL (0615)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/99</field></doc><doc><field name="title">On the ontogeny and phylogeny of the representational mind</field><field name="creator">Suddendorf, Thomas</field><field name="description">This thesis proposes a theory for fundamental aspects of the evolution and development of the representational mind. Building on Perner's (1991) theory of representational development, it is suggested that mind evolved from the ability to represent current reality (primary mind) to further entertain secondary representations of hypothetical content (collating mind) to finally represent representational relations themselves (metamind). In child development these transitions can be observed by about 18 months and by about 42 to 48 months. In comparative analysis only the great apes show signs of a collating mind. Young children and great apes can, for example, pretend, consider a limited future and past, solve problems by insight, and consider others' basic mental states. By about age four children begin to show evidence for metarepresentation in their ability to pass theory-of-mind tasks. At about the same age they also gain considerable executive control which, together with metarepresentation, is the key cognitive advance of metamind. Empirical evidence suggests that various skills co-develop with metamind and the thesis includes four studies that investigate such associations. It was found that gestural representation with imaginary objects and the generation of creative problem solutions were robustly correlated with theory-of-mind measures. These results substantiate the claim for a domain-general change in cognitive ability by about age four. Understanding delayed video feedback, however, was not found to correlate with such measures and it is questioned whether delayed feedback tasks measure an extended sense of self as has been proposed (Povinelli, 1995; Suddendorf &amp; Corballis, 1997). Great apes, while showing evidence for a collating mind, have not yet provided any convincing evidence for metamind. It is thus suggested that metamind developed after the split from the line that led to modern chimpanzees about five million years ago. Metamind, it is argued, was a prime mover in human phylogeny and is a crucial step in human ontogeny.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">PSYCHOLOGY, DEVELOPMENTAL (0620)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/100</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Semiotics and the discourse of architecture</field><field name="creator">Walker, Paul Joseph</field><field name="description">This thesis addresses a problematic of meaning and of semiotics in architecture by considering a number of questions. Why have meaning and semiotics been of concern in architectural discourse? How did semiotics enter that discourse? How does it operate there?    The first chapter explores the notion of meaning in art, assuming this to have bearing on meaning in architecture. Functionalism is investigated as an implicitly semantic view of architecture: it is proposed that it is the failure of functionalism in practice which underlies the recent concern with meaning.    Chapter 2 introduces the work of eight semioticians: Saussure, Peirce, Morris, Mukarovsky, Jakobson, Levi-Strauss, Barthes, and Eco.    Chapter 3 poses the question of why semiotics has been attractive to architects. Attention is given to Tafuri's notion that semiotics serves both to bolster the current status of architecture (by blockading investigation of its discursive characteristics) and as radial criticism. Work by Norberg-Schulz and by Jencks is shown to be blockade; that by Agrest and Gandelsonas more nearly critical. It is proposed that semiotics and the discourse of modern architecture are epistemologically analogous, which circumstance has facilitated and been conditional to the entry of semiotics into architecture.    The fourth chapter examines Eco's and Preziosi's rigorous semiotic theories of the built. Both have been posited, however, as theories of architecture; as such they impede rather than foster theorizing with respect to architectural discourse.    Chapter 5 assumes a (semiotic) model of architecture as a hierarchy of codes (building, language, drawing, photography). The role of language in architecture is shown to be more important than is generally conceded. Architectural discourse is also shown to be dependent on photography, and, by implication, on other graphic modes.    While bearing in mind the links between the postmodern and radical strains of semiotics, the final chapter surveys architecture in culture's present postmodern moment. If the problematic of meaning in architecture has been motivated by the 'emptiness' of the built world constructed under the aegis of functional architecture, this problematic cannot be taken as a recuperation. Rather, the advent of semiotics in the discourse of architecture may signify its transposition to an unknown discursive configuration.</field><field name="date">1987</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ARCHITECTURE (0729)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/102</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Constructing the "other" : on being a man and a nurse</field><field name="creator">Harding, Thomas S</field><field name="description">This study explores the experiences of men who are nurses in Aotearoa New Zealand. Utilising discourse analysis a social constructionist reading of men, masculinity and nursing is provided to offer an alternative reading to much of the extant literature with respect to men in nursing. The study draws upon a number of different sources of "text", including over 600 written works, two films and interviews with eighteen men who currently are, have been or are intending to be, nurses. Drawing primarily upon the "literary" textual sources a number of themes were identified for further exploration in interview with the coresearchers. These themes were the construction of masculinity, the construction of images of the nurse, the reaction to men who are nurses, sexuality issues, career development, and men and caring. The findings of this thesis reveal that the literature pertaining to men in nursing is replete with paradox and contradiction and fails to adequately account for the male experience. It is argued that the images and arguments provided in the literature with respect to men in nursing are based on out-of-date models and understandings of gender relations, masculinity and nursing. It is suggested that rather than enjoying patriarchal privilege, men who enter nursing must contend with being constructed as both an inferior man and inferior nurse. Their careers are not, as is alleged in the literature, based on developing "islands of masculinity" and male privilege, nor upon the avoidance of the emotional labour of nursing but reflect a belief that career is one way of doing care. It is argued in this work that men in nursing have fewer "taken-as-givens" upon which to base work and that they work to develop trusting relationships with their patients that are based on communication and empathy within a context defined by the patients' circumstances.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Health Sciences, Nursing (0569)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/103</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Implementation and assessment of a new integrated drug administration system (IDAS) as an example of a safety intervention in a complex socio-technological workplace</field><field name="creator">Webster, Craig Stephen</field><field name="description">The rate of injury and death inadvertently caused by medical treatment is too high and exacts enormous human and financial costs. Each year in Britain and the United States alone, hundreds of thousands of patients are injured, ten of thousands are killed and billions of dollars are spent on additional health care due to iatrogenic harm. Health care organisations remain predominately human-centred in their approach to safety-that is, methods of avoiding error rely primarily on the resolve and vigilance of individual clinicians to avoid bad outcomes. However, this approach is becoming increasingly inadequate in the face of the steadily rising complexity of modern health care and the increasing number of procedures carried out each year. In other high-reliability organisations such as aviation and nuclear power generation, safety results not from the sheer effort of &#8220;operators&#8221;, but from in-depth analysis of problems and the removal and redesign of dangerous aspects of systems-the so-called systems approach. Here I present an evaluation of the integrated drug administration system (IDAS) as an example of the systems approach, intended to reorganise the way in which anaesthetists give drugs to improve performance and facilitate safe practice. The problem of drug error in anaesthesia is an important subset of iatrogenic harm in medicine. From the prospective study of 10806 conventional anaesthetics I define the rate of drug error in anaesthesia as one error in every 133 anaesthetics conducted-a rate five times higher than anything previously reported. In addition, anaesthetists rated the risk of harming a patient through drug error in the course of their career as high. I discuss the principles of safe system design, the psychology of error, and advanced systems safety concepts with respect to the design of the IDAS and the future of safety in medicine. In clinical use, the IDAS saved time before and during anaesthesia, and was rated by anaesthetists as significantly safer and more useable than conventional methods of drug administration. This work supports the hypothesis that error in anaesthesia can be reduced through the systematic analysis of its causes and the implementation of appropriate countermeasure strategies.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">HEALTH SCIENCES, PHARMACOLOGY (0419)</field><field name="subject">HEALTH SCIENCES, OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY (0354)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/104</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Network strategy in the New Zealand wine industry : how firms in an industry understand and use their business relationships</field><field name="creator">Benson-Rea, Maureen</field><field name="description">Network strategy in the New Zealand wine industry: how firms in an industry understand and use their business relationshipsThis theory-building study offers new theoretical explanations for how and why companies within a case industry use relationships in their strategies. Using qualitative data from multiple case studies within the New Zealand wine industry, the thesis captures and explains the strategic heterogeneity of diverse patterns of relationships and network interactions and how these are used strategically. Drawing on strategic management and business network theory, it emphasises how firms value their relationships in strategy, that is, how they contribute to strategy formation process and realisation outcomes. The study builds new interpretations and extends theory through in-depth exploration, providing two extensive typologies of relationships, one categorised according to the range of relationships, their functions, content and contribution to strategy, and another according to strategies and how relationships are used in their realisation. A model of relationship drivers in strategy is then developed, tested, and refined to show the purposes and outcomes of relationships and clarify the processes and conditions under which they arise and are used within an industry. The data support converging assumptions in strategic management and business network theory on the connectedness of firms in business relationships and the embeddedness of economic action in ongoing ties within social structures. Concepts of intentionality and emergence are used to show that emergence primarily arises out of intentionality.Understanding of relationships was based on the historically collective nature of the industry, on personal values, experience or approaches to relationships, on firm level strategy, especially decisions around grow, buy or connect options, and whether the firm aimed to control resources and activities internally or used relationships to achieve strategic goals. Firms focused on (in order of priority): resource-based input requirements, activity-based capability related strategies and actor-based values and these inputs operated at three levels which, singly or in combination, drove the diverse use of relationships: firm level strategy influences, relationship level influences and industry environment level influences. Two frameworks emerge which have strong explanatory power. One models how firms understanding and value placed on relationships is integrated into strategy processes. Another integrates concepts in a new way to show the main pathways through ways of understanding relationship development and use in strategy.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Strategy ; International Business ; Marketing</field><field name="subject">Business Administration, Marketing (0338)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/105</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Resilience against stress and depression in the postpartum period</field><field name="creator">Thio, Irene Marie</field><field name="description">Background. Because there have been few studies examining resilience associated with postnatal (PN) depression, this study aimed at formulating and testing a theory-based model integrating both traditional resilience paradigms and non-traditional factors including existential beliefs about life, motherhood and religion.    Method. Study hypotheses addressed prediction of PN depression, stress and resilience, and the confounding influence of negative affectivity (neuroticism). Study variables included PN depression (Edinburgh PN Depression Scale, EPDS), stress, neuroticism, self-esteem, mother's distress and ambivalence, purpose/meaning, religious belief, parity, age, marital and social status. They were assessed with standardized self-report instruments and, following a pilot, administered to a probability sample of women four months postpartum in a one-wave, community, postal survey. Because the overall response rate was so low (49%) only the Europeans were included in the study (N = 225; response-rate = 78%). Statistical hypothesis-testing included linear and logistical multivariate model-twilding techniques, and principal components analysis.    Results. Sixteen percent scored in the major depression range (EPDS &gt; 12), and 14% in the minor depression range. Depression was associated with stress, neuroticism, purpose/meaning, mother's distress and (marginally) religious belief, but not with self-esteem, mother's ambivalence, age, parity or social class. Although neuroticism was strongly associated with depression, and also overlapped with most psycho-social variables, nonetheless stress, purpose/meaning, and mother's distress maintained significant relationships with depression after neuroticism was statistically controlled. Stress was associated in part with the perception of losing one's freedom in the motherhood role (neuroticism controlled). When resilience was defined as high stress coupled with low depression, it was associated with low levels of neuroticism and mother's distress. When resilience was defined in terms of high levels of maternal satisfaction, it was associated with high purpose and low ambivalence. Principal components analyses revealed that (1) stress scores reflected two dimensions suggestive of distress and self-efficacy; and (2) depression, stress, neuroticism, self-esteem and purpose were markers for the same underlying component, whereas mother's distress and ambivalence were markers for another (unrelated) component.    Conclusion. This study underlines the relevance of temperament, self-efficacy, self-transcendence, existential beliefs and motherhood-related cogniitions to the understanding of PN depression and stress.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">PSYCHOLOGY, CLINICAL (0622)</field><field name="subject">PSYCHOLOGY, PERSONALITY (0625)</field><field name="subject">PSYCHOLOGY, SOCIAL (0451)</field><field name="subject">HEALTH SCIENCES, MENTAL HEALTH (0347)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/106</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The evolution of the New Zealand monarchy:  The recognition of an autochthonous polity</field><field name="creator">Cox, Noel Stanley Bertie</field><field name="description">The aims of this thesis are to determine to what extent the Crown remains important as a source of legitimacy for the constitutional order and as a focus of sovereignty; how the Crown has developed as a distinct institution; and what the prospects are for the adoption of a republican form of government in New Zealand.    The imperial Crown has evolved into the New Zealand Crown, yet the implications of this change are as yet only slowly being understood. Largely this is because that evolution came about as a result of gradual political development, as part of an extended process of independence, rather than by deliberate and conscious decision.    The continuing evolution of political independence does not necessarily mean that New Zealand will become a republic in the short-to-medium term. This is for various reasons. The concept of the Crown has often been, in New Zealand, of greater importance than the person of the Sovereign, or that of the Governor-General. The existence of the Crown has also contributed to, rather than impeded, the independence of New Zealand, through the division of imperial prerogative powers. In particular, while the future constitutional status of the Treaty of Waitangi remains uncertain, the Crown appears to have acquired greater legitimacy through being a party to the Treaty. The expression of national identity does not necessarily require the removal of the Crown.    The very physical absence of the Sovereign, and the all-pervading nature of the legal concept of the Crown, have also contributed to that institution's development as a truly national organ of government. The concept of the Crown has now, to a large extent, been separated from its historical, British, roots. This has been encouraged by conceptual confusion over the symbolism and identity of the Crown. But this merely illustrates the extent to which the Crown has become an autochthonous polity, grounded in our own unique settlement and evolution since 1840. Whether that conceptual strength is sufficient to counterbalance symbolic and other challenges in the twenty-first century remains uncertain. But it is certain that the Crown has had a profound affect upon the style and structure of government in New Zealand.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">POLITICAL SCIENCE, GENERAL (0615)</field><field name="subject">LAW (0398)</field><field name="subject">HISTORY, ASIA, AUSTRALIA AND OCEANIA (0332)</field><field name="subject">Legal history</field><field name="subject">Politics</field><field name="subject">International law</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420300 Cultural Studies::420305 New Zealand cultural studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/107</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluation of simulation-based education in the management of medical emergencies</field><field name="creator">Weller, Jennifer Mary</field><field name="description">The traditional approach to medical education is changing and simulation is increasingly being incorporated into the curriculum, particularly in the context of emergency care. Simulation takes many forms, but this thesis refers only to whole patient simulators, where a computerised mannikin placed in a clinically appropriate environment is used to recreate a realistic clinical encounter. The focus of this work is the management of medical emergencies. Aim The overall aim of this body of work is to evaluate the effectiveness of simulationbased education across a range of different learners, and to investigate the properties of simulation-based assessment. In particular:  To review the literature on the effectiveness of simulation, and its use in assessment.  To evaluate the current status and effectiveness of CME interventions and the relative usefulness of simulation courses in this context.  To determine if simulation-based courses in crisis management can lead to changes in physician behaviour. iii  To evaluate student perceptions of learning in a simulator environment.  To assess students' ability to manage simulated emergencies, and their opinion of simulation-based assessment.  To define the psychometric properties and feasibility of simulation-based assessment in anaesthesia, the accuracy of self-assessment and the impact on learning. Methods and Results A number of different methods were used, which will be described in detail in the subsequent chapters. Overall, the results provide evidence for the effectiveness of simulation across a range of applications. Simulation-based assessment is acceptable, likely to have a positive impact on learning, and evidence support aspects of validity. Reliable scores can be generated but large numbers of cases are required. Conclusions There is sufficient evidence to recommend incorporating simulation-based courses into the acute care curriculum of medical undergraduates. Simulation is effective in CME in the context of anaesthesia crisis management and this is likely to apply to other acute care specialties. Like other clinically based assessments, extended testing time is required to generate reliable scores, limiting the feasibility of large scale, simulation-based exit examinations.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Health Sciences, Medicine and Surgery (0564)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/109</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Furthering the role of corporate finance in economic growth</field><field name="creator">Kamiryo, Hideyuki, 1930-</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.

A total of 517 Taiwanese EFL students from four educational levels were recruited for inquiring into the development of EFL writing. Quantitative analyses of writing tasks, vocabulary tests and questionnaires were used to describe and explain the multi-faceted nature of EFL writing in terms of the likely influencing factors.    Initially the contributions of respective factors were examined separately. Rhetorical analyses of students' English and Chinese compositions showed there were co-existing positive and negative influences of first language (L1) rhetoric on English writing. Analyses of lexical use and errors in English compositions, plus results from the assessment of two vocabulary tests, indicated that lexical and grammatical knowledge was a critical factor in explaining English writing. Results of students' Chinese writing abilities in relation to English writing proficiency revealed that the transfer of Chinese writing expertise was conditioned by a developed Chinese expertise and a lack of English writing experiences. Findings from the written-speech analysis of English essays suggested a transitional development whereby spoken language was used. Analyses of questionnaires indicated that EFL writing was positively related to attention on the macro-level structure and negatively related to micro-level concerns.    Subsequently, integrated analyses were conducted to examine the interplay among these factors. The shared variability of factors contributed a much larger portion to the explanation of developmental changes, suggesting that the development of EFL writing involves the interaction among influencing factors much more than the individual factors themselves. The unique contributions (independent of other interrelated variables) showed that essay length outweighed the other predictors, suggesting a need for instruction to develop the skill of fluency. A determining factor that consistently accounted for English writing performance was the students' levels of English learning and English writing experiences. The implication is that, particularly in the context where writing is neglected for beginning or intermediate learners, there is a need to revitalize writing as a communicative skill in the EFL curriculum.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">LANGUAGE, RHETORIC AND COMPOSITION (0681)</field><field name="subject">EDUCATION, LANGUAGE AND LITERATURE (0279)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/111</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Housing and health (New Zealand)</field><field name="creator">Asaad, Eman</field><field name="description">A belief based on a personal experience that asthma incidence in New Zealand is interrelated with the indoor environment, led the author to establish the study between asthma and housing.    A considerable period of time was spent first on studying the roots of the two issues, asthma and New Zealand housing. The historical experience showed that health and housing problems at the national level in the 19 th century in England were solved by state interference.    The architectural background of this study created a need to cover some medical knowledge to understand the causes, symptoms and cure of asthma, if any. This knowledge was crucial while monitoring houses, designing the questionnaire, and analysing results.    Two stages of monitoring were achieved in 2000 and 2001. In addition to the monitoring, there was an attempt to find out as much information as possible about any issues related to the health conditions, especially the respiratory disorders, and the houses. The study of housing included building construction, house dust mite allergen levels in the carpet, building drawings, and other issues in preparation for the next stage of analysis.    The overwhelming quantity of information gathered about the 30 houses investigated in 2000 was so confusing that no statistical software package was seen as a perfect way for analysing it. It was decided then to establish comparisons between each factor investigated and asthma presence. Also, in most of the cases, the correlation between more than one factor with asthma rates was examined.    The investigation of the relations between many issues and asthma showed that there were links between asthma incidence and some indoor conditions of houses. Raised timber floors, which were found in most of the houses to be un-insulated, and in all the cases to be on unprotected ground, were found to have a strong relation with asthma incidence. In these houses, it was found that high asthma incidence was related to a higher level of moisture indoors. Asthma incidence in houses having old carpet, moulds, pets, or smokers indoors was higher than asthma incidence in houses without these. Old houses were found to have more asthma incidence than new houses. All the allergen levels in the carpets were extremely high and they were all above the allergen levels induced by house dust mites that can provoke asthma in susceptible individuals.    Based on the knowledge gained about the defective factors in housing affecting asthma, upgrading of the houses was designed. A house was chosen to be upgraded in three stages, each stage providing a different level of insulation. The upgrading costs were compared with the current national costs of health and heating to see what level of upgrading would be logical and cost-effective. National costs and savings were estimated in four cases each with different level of insulation. It was decided at the final stage of the study that insulating ceilings and floors in addition to other basic upgrading factors would provide savings in health and heating costs and would result in less CO2 emissions to the atmosphere of New Zealand.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ARCHITECTURE (0729)</field><field name="subject">HEALTH SCIENCES, PUBLIC HEALTH (0573)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/112</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Control of high voltage DC and flexible AC transmission systems</field><field name="creator">Jovcic, Dragan</field><field name="description">Analytical modeling of HVDC systems has been a difficult task without a to-date reported model convenient for serious analysis of practically reported HVDC stability problems. In order to cover the frequency range f&lt;100Hz, and to cater for different model requirements, three different HVDC-HVAC models are developed in this Thesis: Detailed linear-continuous model, simplified linear continuous model and linear discrete model. Detailed HVDC-HVAC system model is intended for small signal analysis of HVDC-HVAC interactions and resulting stability problems. It demonstrates good response matching against PSCAD/EMTDC simulation, where the CIGRE HVDC Benchmark model is used as the test system. All model variables (states) and parameters have physical meaning, and the model consists of modules, which reflect actual physical subsystems. Simplified HVDC-HVAC system dynamic model is developed as a fourth order dynamic model, which is less accurate but more convenient for the analysis, than the detailed model. The model proves to be reliable for controller design for mitigation of composite resonance and for the study of non-linear effects in HVDC systems. The developed linear discrete model is primarily intended for the system analysis at frequencies close to 100Hz on DC side of HVDC system. A new approach in modeling of TCR/TCSC, based on the same principles for HVDC modeling, is presented in this Thesis. The model development is far less difficult than the similar models presented in literature. PSCAD/EMTDC simulation confirms the model validity. The simplified, linear-continuous model is used for the analysis of dominant non-linear effects in HVDC systems. The analysis of non-linear mode transformation between constant beta and constant gamma operation, shows that limit-cycle oscillations are not expected to develop, for normal operating conditions. The analysis of converter firing angle modulation shows that converter behaves as a non-linear element only for some unlikely operating conditions. In this Thesis, it is attempted to counteract the composite resonance phenomenon by modifying the resonant condition on DC system impedance profile. This is accomplished by designing a supplementary HVDC controller that acts on HVDC firing angle on both line ends. PSCAD/EMTDC simulation results show that significant reduction in DC side first harmonic component (in some cases to 1/4 of the original value) is possible with the newly designed controller. Chapter 5 studies 100Hz oscillations on DC side of HVDC system. A methodology for designing a new controller to counteract negative affects of these oscillations is presented. Linear simulation of the detailed controller design confirms noticeable reduction in second harmonic on DC side. The eigenvalue decomposition and singular value decomposition is used for small-signal analysis of HVDC-HVAC interactions. The analysis of sensitivity of the dominant system eigenvalues with respect to the AC system parameters, shows the frequency range for the possible oscillatory instabilities at rectifier and at inverter side. The rectifier side of the system is most likely to experience instability at higher frequencies, whereas at inverter side the instabilities can be expected at lower frequencies. Further analysis shows that reduction in the AC system strength i will predominantly affect the eigenvalues at lower frequencies, where the SCR reduction at inverter side much more affects the system stability. The analysis of interactions between AC and DC systems through the influence of inherent feedback loops gives recommendations for the possible control of interaction variables with the aim of system stability improvement. The root locus technique is used for the stability analysis of HVDC control loops, where all conventional and some alternative control methods suggested in the literature are investigated. It is found that DC feedback, at rectifier side, significantly improves the system stability at lower frequencies, however, at frequencies close to the first harmonic this feedback control degrades the system stability, actually accelerating the development of composite resonance. At inverter side, most of the feedback loops improve the system stability in a certain frequency range, whereas at other frequencies they noticeably deteriorate stability. Among all reported inverter control methods, reactive current feedback is found to be the best option. The last Chapter develops a new controller for HVDC system operation with very weak inverter AC systems. The selection of feedback signal for this controller, is based on the analysis of positioning of zeros for candidate feedback signals. It is found that AC current angle is the best inverter feedback signal. This feedback signal can move the unstable complex eigenvalues left, into the stable region, without significantly affecting remaining eigenvalues. For the additional improvement in the system performance, a second order filter, designed using control theory, is placed into the feedback loop. The main design objective is the system robustness with respect to the AC system parameters changes. The controller designed in this Thesis, tolerates very wide changes in system strength, 1.7&lt;SCR&lt;3.5, with the nominal operating point at SCR=2.5. This wide change of operating parameters, although very unlikely in practice, demonstrates large improvement in the system performance with the new controller. The similar controller especially designed for extremely low SCR, shows that HVDC system can satisfactory operate with SCR=1.0 at inverter side and heralds the possible controller use instead of synchronous condensers or SVC elements at inverter AC bus.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/272</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Organisational learning facilitated by the analysis of student achievement information</field><field name="creator">Millward, Pamela</field><field name="description">This thesis explores reasons for New Zealand&#8217;s problematic tail of literacy underachievement and suggests one way to address the problem, is for schools to operate as learning organizations. A qualitative research design was used to identify elements of organizational learning in the practices of three very different schools identified as improving the students&#8217; learning outcomes. The research methods included semi-structured interviews, team meeting observations, an anonymous questionnaire and document analysis. An analytical framework identifying five elements of organizational learning, developed from a review of the organizational learning literature, was used to evaluate each school&#8217;s ability to learn about their teaching and learning programmes as a result of reviewing students&#8217; achievement information. The research findings identified elements of the organizational learning framework in the practices of all three schools. It was found that whilst the elements of the framework were necessary, the entirety of the framework was most significant in facilitating organizational learning. In order for the schools to learn to improve the learning of their students, they needed to have a well defined infrastructure for the collection, collation, analysis and use of student achievement information. The occurrence of the infrastructure alone did not, however, facilitate organizational learning. The school leaders and teachers needed to apply the appropriate curriculum content, pedagogical and assessment literacy knowledge to the assessment data in order to make sense of it and to use the information to review and refine their teaching and learning programmes. The acquisition of appropriate levels of professional knowledge appeared to be facilitated within a culture where teachers felt safe and confident to challenge and be challenged in their collegial discussions about students&#8217; learning. Rigorous collegial discussions appeared to foster team learning and to be leader driven. When the appropriate professional knowledge was not available within the organization, learning only appeared to occur when the necessary expertise was accessed from the external environment.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/274</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Te kaita&#772;rei ara ta&#772;ngata whenua mo te Whare Wa&#772;nanga : &#8217;E&#772;hara, he hara ranei?&#8217; = Developing indigenous infrastructure in the University :  'Another era or another error?'</field><field name="creator">Robust, Te Tuhi</field><field name="description">Abstract/ Whakar&#257;poto Take The specific aim of this study is to identify critical features of w&#257;nanga or the traditional M&#257;ori learning institution and how these might inform M&#257;ori education today in a University setting. It also examines the responsiveness of the tertiary institution in creating an indigenous infrastructure aimed at M&#257;ori educational participation. A number of &#8216;critical events&#8217; relating to M&#257;ori educational development interventions in the 1980&#8217;s will be considered with the expectation that they will serve to inform the development of better educational outcomes for access, participation, recruitment, retention and the advancement of M&#257;ori in the conventional University setting. For the purpose of this study contemporary M&#257;ori academic sites, which include state funded w&#257;nanga, as well as other indigenous academic sites will be discussed, including the First Nations House of Learning at the University of British Columbia1. There is thus an international perspective in this study. Whare w&#257;nanga were a key institution in traditional M&#257;ori society and represented in all regions of Aotearoa/ New Zealand. The ability to travel and share each other&#8217;s knowledge attested or benchmarked by others was a key part of the maintenance of the tribal lore. T&#333;hunga were central to the entire process of controlling the knowledge and selecting to whom it was to be imparted. This raises a question of what a contemporary w&#257;nanga, as an intervention and an academic entity would look like at the University of Auckland and would it withstand international scrutiny? As a kaupapa M&#257;ori educational intervention, it is a theoretical test in the configurations of conscientization, resistance and transformative praxis. The inclusive approach in using existing material and people resources to maximize the impact of the intervention is to be discussed in this thesis. Specific case studies provide a means for checking the evidence for the processes and the predicted outcomes for kaupapa M&#257;ori theory. The recalling of events is central to both case studies. An event such as the rugby match that took place between both countries in 1927, discussed later in this thesis, combined with similar initiatives embarked upon by indigenous leaders from both tertiary communities to create a physical presence for First Nations and M&#257;ori, are identities at the core of the case studies. Cultural connection, and a style of operation that is inclusive, enact in part the values raised by Madeleine McIvor: respect, reciprocity, relevance and responsibility. The factors all converge to build this thesis into a series of conversations. The collaboration undertaken over long distances and periods of time has motivated the creation of this record of the stories of both institutions, that can be added to by others in the future. The markers of success for the University of Auckland include the arresting of the decline of M&#257;ori student enrolments alongside the growth of M&#257;ori participating in post-graduate study and research, therefore providing opportunity to contribute to the bank of knowledge in New Zealand society. While the regeneration of the language in New Zealand has been the driving force behind the w&#257;nanga development at the University of Auckland building further on the foundations of kohanga reo, kura kaupapa M&#257;ori, whare kura and w&#257;nanga, the development of M&#257;ori as with First Nations initiatives has been in the area of education. Tertiary institutions offer a context in which kaupapa M&#257;ori theory brings together common threads of communication for people. Whether this is through elements of struggle within societies or just survival, the main thing is that people need each other to develop and progress.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420300 Cultural Studies::420306 Maori cultural studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/275</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A public silence : discursive practices surrounding homosexuality</field><field name="creator">Semp, David</field><field name="description">Considerable research points to an elevated prevalence of mental health problems and suicide for men who have sex with men (MSM). Yet there is little research on how public mental health services (PMHS) does, or could, address the needs of MSM. When such literature does appear, a common suggestion is that queer staff will be necessary to improve PMHS for MSM through a process of &#8216;matching&#8217;. Yet, no research has specifically explored the views of queer staff or MSM clients on this. Further, a positivist trend within the existing literature contains individualising and essentialising assumptions that limit our understanding of relationships between MSM and PMHS. Adopting a critical social constructionist perspective, I argue that Foucauldian theory and its analysis of the relationships between discourses, power, and subjectivity, enables research to focus on the social and structural processes constructing mental health care for MSM. This thesis explores the discursive construction of the relationships between MSM and PMHS, and the implications of this for practice. My analysis begins by explicating commonly circulating discourses of homosexuality, and of mental health, in New Zealand. These discourses are evidenced in (but not limited to) academic literature, governmental documents, and queer and mainstream media. They provide a framework for the analysis of interviews with 12 queer staff and 13 MSM clients of PMHS. The analyses illustrate the multiple discourses informing the MSM&#8217;s subjectivities as homosexuals and show the predominant discourses they draw on to account for their mental health problems. I suggest the term &#8216;homonegative trauma&#8217; to denote this. Analyses of the staff and clients&#8217; accounts around the &#8216;disclosure&#8217; of homosexuality within PMHS reveal discursive power relations which restrain staff, and some clients, from acknowledging homosexuality. I consider two strategies for disrupting this heteronormative silence within PMHS. I contend that the notion of &#8216;matching&#8217; queer clients and staff is a minoritising one, with limited ability to counter heteronormativity. In contrast, a universalising approach requires all staff to initiate conversations with all clients about sexuality. Making a comparison between staff inquiring about sexuality, and the currently recommended practice of staff asking about sexual abuse, I argue that this analogy provides useful resources to support such a universalising move. I conclude by arguing for systemic and structural changes in PMHS to support staff to routinely enquire about sexuality. If done with an awareness of the discursive complexity involved, such a shift has the potential to disrupt heteronormative practices within PMHS. My analysis suggests that the power of the medical discourse in particular, will be a significant restraint to such a change. However, if heteronormative practices within PMHS remain unchallenged they will continue to silence some MSM clients, thereby, maintaining the homonegative trauma described by most of the MSM clients interviewed. This would reproduce a tendency within the medical discourse to focus on individual pathology and to evade the ways in which social marginalisation and oppression can be constructive of mental health problems.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/276</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Pathways to literacy and transitions to school : enabling incorporation and developing awareness of literacy</field><field name="creator">Tamarua, Lavinia Tina</field><field name="description">This study examines children&#8217;s development and incorporation of literacy expertise across multiple sites and the transitions to school by four M&#257;ori preschool children, their wh&#257;nau (families) and their teachers in Aotearoa/New Zealand. This study is embedded in a Kaupapa M&#257;ori framework of understanding and explaining teaching and learning processes across multiple sites of learning for children whose practices reflect ways of being and acting M&#257;ori. Descriptions of teaching and learning processes are also explained utilising a co-constructivist theoretical framework. These descriptions and explanations focus on the psychological processes of learning and development that children, wh&#257;nau and teachers&#8217; engage in their practice. A two phase case study design was employed that examines the teaching and learning processes of literacy across multiple sites. The first phase provides qualitative data that describes and explains how the different sorts of literacy and language activities are coconstructed by wh&#257;nau and children. The ways by which literacy activities are constructed are inherent in parents ideas about teaching and learning reflected out of their diverse pedagogical practices. The distinct pedagogical practices also highlight the multiple pathways to learning that children developed and experienced in becoming an expert. This study also reported the influence of early educational settings as alternative and multiple contexts by which learning is organised and constructed. The different contexts provided families with specific ideas and practices about the teaching and learning process. The second phase of the study provides descriptions of how children&#8217;s literacy expertise was incorporated into classroom literacy and language activities. This phase of the study examines how teachers provided opportunities by which children&#8217;s literacy expertise was incorporated into classroom activities. This study reported incidents where incorporation of children&#8217;s level of literacy expertise was enhanced while other children&#8217;s literacy expertise was discouraged in classroom activities. The significance of the reported differences of incorporation was provided from teacher&#8217;s ideas and beliefs about children&#8217;s literacy expertise upon entry to school. The study showed how teacher&#8217;s ideas reflected the way that they organised and constructed literacy activities. Teacher&#8217;s ideas also reflected their awareness of the diversity of children&#8217;s literacy expertise. The earlier phase of this study examined the multiple ways and multiple contexts by which children learn and develop literacy expertise. Incorporation of children&#8217;s literacy expertise into classroom activities was determined by the degree to which teachers made connections that resonated children&#8217;s expertise. This was also determined by teacher&#8217;s instructional practices in the context of the classroom environment. The implications of this study make important contributions to pedagogical practices for teachers in classroom environments. The descriptions and explanations reported in this study highlight the complexities of teaching and learning for children of diverse cultural and language communities.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420300 Cultural Studies::420306 Maori cultural studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/277</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Electroless nickel-phosphorus (EN) coatings on magnesium and magnesium alloys</field><field name="creator">Liu, Zhenmin</field><field name="description">Magnesium (Mg) and its alloys are being used as structural components in industries because of their high strength-to-weight ratio and relatively high stiffness. A shortcoming of Mg alloys is poor corrosion and wear resistance that have hindered its widespread applications. Corrosion can be minimized by using high purity alloys, rapid solidification, and surface treatment or coatings. Of these techniques, electroless nickelphosphorus (EN) coating is one of the most effective methods to combat the problems. The objective of this research is to understand the relationships of processing, microstructure and properties of EN coatings on Mg alloys, and therefore to develop uniform, well-adhered, pore-free EN based coatings. In the first stage of the work, three types of EN coatings, namely, low, medium, and high phosphorus, were deposited on Mg and its alloy substrates. In the second stage of this research, EN coatings containing superfine Al2O3 particles and a novel plasma electrolysis assisted EN plating processing were developed on Mg alloys. XRD, SEM, TEM, EDX, XPS, and some corrosion and mechanical testing methods were implemented to evaluate and characterize the above EN-based coatings. The effects of various alloy substrates and plating bath parameters on coating deposition rate, porosity, phosphorus content, and properties, were studied in detail. Furthermore, the effect of post heat treatment on the properties of EN coatings was also investigated. The results of this study show that the properties of EN coatings are directly related to the phosphorus content and porosity of the coatings, and various Mg alloy substrates. EN coatings with low phosphorus content are nano-crystalline, hard and ductile. As a result, they have superior adhesion strength. EN coatings with medium phosphorus content have an amorphous structure with better corrosion and wear resistance. Especially, the medium phosphorus EN coatings produced by novel plasma electrolysis assisted processes provide superior corrosion resistance and higher adhesion strength. The novel EN technique is also an environmental friendly processing. Direct high phosphorus EN coatings show the least kinetic coefficient of friction and good wear resistance under dry sliding friction because of the self-lubricating nature of phosphorus element. However, the porosity is severe within the direct high phosphorus coatings, which is detrimental to its corrosion property. Adhesion strength and wear resistance of EN alumina composite coating on Mg alloys are improved significantly. It has also been demonstrated that the adhesion strength of EN on Mg alloys is strongly II related to several parameters including coating thickness, hardness, internal stress, nucleation density, and the substrate&#8217;s chemical and physical nature. In conclusion, this research has made good progress on producing a series of uniform, well-adhered, and pore-free EN-based coatings through better understanding of the relationships of processing, microstructure and properties. The EN-based coatings can provide adequate corrosion and/or wear resistance to Mg and Mg alloys.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/278</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Spatial variations in the membrane properties of differentiating fibre cells isolated from the rat lens</field><field name="creator">Webb, Kevin F</field><field name="description">The ocular lens is a dense avascular structure composed of a bulk of terminally differentiated elongated fibre cells. During differentiation, lens fibre cells lose their nuclei and organelles and are laid down in successive layers to create a pseudocrystalline cellular architecture, where extracellular space dimensions are kept below the wavelength of visible light. Disruption of this precise structural arrangement leads to the development of cataract and eventual blindness. Differences in membrane transport within different regions of the lens, connected by gap junctions, are thought to generate a unique microcirculatory system which is essential for lens transparency - regulating tissue volume and ionic homeostasis and supplying internalised fibre cells with metabolic and antioxidant support. While the spatial differences in membrane transport thought to drive the lens internal circulation system have been inferred from intact-lens measurements, they have not yet been confirmed at the cellular level. Problems isolating and working with lens fibre cells has lead to a historical lack of information about the role of these cells in lens physiology. This thesis describes the development and characterisation of a viable isolated fibre cell preparation, representing the first investigation of physiological membrane behaviour in single fibre cells isolated from the rat lens. It was found that by blocking non-selective cation channels activated by fibre cell dissociation with ionic gadolinium, isolated fibre cells of a range of lengths could be maintained viable for several hours in the presence of physiological [Ca2+]o. Furthermore, fibre cell length in vitro was similar to that measured in the intact lens, allowing the spatial localisation of measured membrane properties within the outer lens cortex. The measured membrane properties of isolated fibre cells indicate that membrane conductances are altered during fibre cell differentiation, thus creating spatial differences in membrane transport across the lens radius. The measured transition from K+-selectivity towards Na+/Cl- selectivity during fibre cell elongation confirms inferred properties derived from intact-lens studies. These alterations in the membrane properties of differentiating fibre cells are arranged spatially in a manner appropriate for the generation of the circulating ion fluxes thought to form the lens internal circulation system. To investigate the role of fibre cell membrane properties in both physiological and pathological circumstances, modulation of fibre cell membrane properties was demonstrated by osmotic and pharmacological means. Data obtained indicates that fibre cells respond to osmotic or metabolic insult by altering their membrane behaviour. The physiological and pathological alteration in fibre cell membrane properties described directly answers significant outstanding questions in lens physiology, and has the potential to generate new therapeutic interventions in the development of cataract</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/280</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Passive myocardial mechanics : constitutive laws and materials parameter estimation</field><field name="creator">Schmid, Holger</field><field name="description">This study investigated the performance of orthotropic constitutive laws describing the passive mechanical behaviour of the myocardium. The performance was validated against simple shear experiments of pig hearts which were available from earlier studies. First, a homogeneous deformation model was developed which captured the main features of the deformation process. This served as the basis for a comparative study between three phenomenological material laws that had been published in the literature. Two of these laws exhibited certain limitations and two further constitutive laws were therefore developed that removed these limitations. Thus, five material laws were investigated in terms of their performance to fit the given experimental data by reducing a least-square objective function between the experimental and model data. Furthermore the consistency of the material parameters amongst experiments was investigated. As part of this study, a modified least-squares objective function was developed that decreased the computational time involved by about two orders of magnitude with comparable error. Second, the assumption of a homogeneous deformation of simple shear was removed and the parameters were estimated using a finite element environment using an inverse estimation technique and therefore fulfilling the equations of motion that underpin continuum mechanics. It was found that the material parameters of all laws were in the same range compared to those obtained from the homogeneous study. Relaxing the homogeneous assumptions slightly reduced the objective function error although the computational time increased by three orders of magnitude. Third, the experimental protocol of six simple shear modes was supplemented with three uniaxial deformations modes. The material parameters for the same constitutive relations were estimated. It was possible to show that the material parameters that were associated with shear strain were very similar to those obtained from the simple shear study. The axial material parameters, however, were considerably different. Finally, since it is recognised that phenomenological material laws do not provide insight into the underlying micro-structural mechanisms, the framework for a multi-scale constitutive relation was developed. This is based on multi-scale images of rat myocardium.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/279</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mechanical properties of passive rat cardiac trabeculae</field><field name="creator">Kirton, Robert S.</field><field name="description">In this thesis, the mechanical properties of quiescent, intact, viable, rat right-ventricular (RV) trabeculae were investigated. The main objective was to determine if strainsoftening, which is commonly reported during the deformation of passive cardiac tissue, is present in viable trabeculae. Strain-softening is typically manifested by a stiffer force-extension relation in the first deformation cycle relative to subsequent cycles, and is distinguished from viscoelasticity by a lack of recovery of stiffness, even after several hours of rest. The causes of this behaviour are unknown. To investigate whether strain-softening is observed during uniaxial extensions of viable cardiac tissue, stretch and release cycles of 5%, 10% and 15% muscle length were applied at a constant velocity to trabeculae mounted in a mechanical rig. The rig was custom-built for the purpose. Muscles at 26&#176;C and 0.5 mM Ca2+ were tested in random order in the presence and absence of 50 mM 2,3-butanedione monoxime (BDM). Strain-softening was not observed in viable trabeculae undergoing physiologically relevant extensions, either in the presence or absence of BDM. However, strainsoftening was readily apparent in non-viable trabeculae undergoing the same levels of extension, whether in the presence or absence of BDM. BDM had no effect on passive compliance of viable specimens, while its presence partially inhibited, but could not prevent, stiffening of the non-viable specimens. Loss of viability was accompanied by a uniform increase of dynamic stiffness. The presence of strain-softening during length extensions of non-viable tissue, resulted in a uniform decrease of dynamic stiffness. It is therefore concluded that strain-softening is neither intrinsic to viable rat RV trabeculae nor influenced by BDM but, rather, reflects irreversible damage of tissue in partial, or full, rigor. The addition of BDM was found to alter the dynamic stiffness and phase measured in intact viable quiescent trabeculae. In the absence of BDM, these alterations were calcium- and temperature-sensitive, whereas in the presence of BDM they were not. Therefore, the BDM-induced alteration of the dynamic stiffness and phase is attributed to the inhibition of spontaneous sarcomere activity.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/282</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Children in the moral community : predictive genetic testing of children for adult onset diseases : some ethical implications</field><field name="creator">Malpas, Phillipa Jean</field><field name="description">Where are children situated in the moral community? Are children special from a moral point of view? Does children&#8217;s youth and vulnerability say anything significant about how we ought to treat them? These questions seek to articulate and clarify the moral status of children by considering what is required to be the beneficiary of moral standing, and furthermore, the ways in which we, as moral agents, are obliged to treat them. The ways in which we answer these questions has significant implications for children, particularly in the area of predictive genetic testing. My thesis is divided into two sections. In the first section I examine the moral status of children within the moral community and the obligations owed to them from parents and society. This is important for a number of significant reasons: Firstly, within the literature children are often portrayed as smaller, less competent versions of adults, yet they are clearly different to adults in many significant ways. Secondly, whilst we claim that children are precious and deserve to be protected from harm, we continue to abuse, neglect, and treat them with indifference in our families and communities. Finally, children grow up and assume their place in the world. This suggests that their moral status changes over time. If children are important members of the moral community as I suggest they are, then we ought to be clear about what their moral status obliges of us as adults. This has crucial implications for children in the area of predictive genetic testing for adult onset diseases. In section two I build on the ethical framework and conclusions reached in the first section and examine the specific question of whether we ought to genetically test children for adult onset diseases. All international genetic service provider guidelines and professional genetic societies do not recommend testing currently healthy, asymptomatic children for such diseases. I examine their positions and consider the arguments not to test children for adult onset diseases.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/283</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Systematic sampling in ecology</field><field name="creator">Pawley, Matthew David McDonald</field><field name="description">Random start systematic sampling (SYS) is a survey design that is simple (it selects the whole sample with one random start), easy to implement and that can, in theory, give precise estimates of ecological abundance in the presence of positive spatial autocorrelation. However, SYS suffers from a serious defect, namely, that it is not possible to obtain an unbiased estimator of sampling variance (&#952;SYS) on the basis of a single sample. A variety of approximations have been suggested, and unbiased modelbased methods have been calculated, but validation of these estimators has been limited within the ecological literature. The heart of any spatial problem is how to deal with spatial autocorrelation. We show that the scale of spatial inference gives a framework that unifies the commonly reported, discordant views about autocorrelation (i.e. &#8216;autocorrelation increases the power of the analysis&#8217; vs &#8216;autocorrelation decreases the power of the analysis&#8217;). The scale of spatial inference is rarely discussed or considered, but we suggest that it should be the first step in any (spatial) analysis. The thesis then uses computer simulation to compare the performance of eleven previously proposed SYS estimators (including simple random sampling, 4SRS). The computer simulations are designed to recreate the spatial distribution characteristics that are common within ecological abundances. We also develop and test a novel method of estimating &#952;SYS based on &#8216;Krige&#8217;s Additivity Relationship&#8217; and variography (geostatistics). This estimator was labelled 4KAR. We found that if the right spatial model (i.e. a reference theoretical variogram) is used, then 4KAR appears to be an unbiased estimator of &#952;. Without a priori knowledge about the spatial structure (so the theoretical variogram is constructed solely from SYS data), 4KAR was generally one of the least biased and most stable estimators out of those examined. The other estimator that fared well, 4r1, was also model-based; it used an estimate of the first order autocorrelation in its estimate of &#952;. 4SRS performed comparatively well on untransformed ecological simulations, but was the worst performing estimator after a log(x+1) transformation.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/284</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Identification and Interpretation of Characteristic Periodic Variations of Near Surface Fluids in the Te Aroha, Rotorua, and Orakeikorako Geothermal Fields of New Zealand using Wavelet and Fourier Analysis</field><field name="creator">Leaver, Jonathan David</field><field name="description">This thesis presents the analysis of a series of experimental measurements from a selection of springs, geysers and wells at Te Aroha, Rotorua and Orakeikorako in New Zealand aimed at the identification of the frequencies of any characteristic variations with a period of 25 hours or less. The measurements taken from these sources collectively recorded water level, conductivity, temperature, rainfall and barometric pressure. The measurements involve the collection of data with high accuracy instrumentation and high sampling rates of 5 minutes to 1 hour over periods exceeding 1400 hours in both exploited and unexploited hydrothermal systems. The measurements are filtered using both an adaptive wavelet based filter and Fourier analysis to extract the influence of gravity tides, rainfall, and barometric pressure with the residual dominant frequencies being attributed to sub-surface thermodynamic processes. A review of the development of techniques for the determination of the pressure response of geothermal reservoirs to barometric pressure, gravity tides, and rainfall is presented. The fundamentals for the mathematical development of Fourier and wavelet analysis are discussed along with sources of error for both Fourier and wavelet analysis. A sensitivity study of wavelet and Fourier analysis is presented based on the analysis of a series of artificial signals. A system dynamics model of a spring at Orakeikorako is formulated to demonstrate fundamental heat and mass transfer processes and the effect of periodic forcing functions on spring response. This study is of importance in that it provides an understanding of periodic forcing functions derived from high accuracy measurements on geothermal features at high sampling rates over periods exceeding 1400 hours. Once identified, the amplitude and frequency of the forcing functions can be monitored to assist in identifying and quantifying any changes in reservoir characteristics.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/346</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Fauna and Biostratigraphy of the Jurassic Latady Formation, Antarctic Peninsula</field><field name="creator">Hikuroa, Daniel Carl Henare</field><field name="description">The Latady Formation is a suite of Middle to Late Jurassic (170 &#8211; 140 Ma) sedimentary rocks situated in the southeastern region of the Antarctic Peninsula near where the break-up of Gondwana probably began. Latady Formation strata comprise a ~2.8 km thick sequence of black and grey shale and siltstone, light brown sandstone, with subordinate conglomerate and sparse thin limestone and coal that accumulated in a back-arc position in the &#8216;Bay of Antarctica&#8217;. The sediments record terrestrial through to distal-shelf environments and are abundantly fossiliferous in places. Substantial paleontological collections of ~3300 specimens from 219 localities were made during a British Antarctic Survey deep field expedition to the Orville Coast in the 1999/2000 field season. The majority of fossils in the Latady Formation are poorly preserved internal and external moulds. Such material makes taxonomic description difficult. Nevertheless, a diverse, entirely marine fauna comprising 177 taxa (7 phyla, 93 genera) is recorded, dominated by marine invertebrates, predominantly bivalves, but also cephalopods, brachiopods, echinoderms, annelids, an arthropod, and a solitary coral. Vertebrates constitute a minor component (4 specimens), consisting of at least two, possibly three, species of fish and the second marine reptile recorded from the Antarctic Peninsula. 15 new species are described (but not named) in the following genera: &#8216;Paracerithium&#8217;, Lopatinia (s.l.), Modiolus, Pinna, Retroceramus, Oxytoma, Meleagrinella, Camptonectes (Camptochlamys), Myophorella (Scaphogonia), Vaugonia (3 species), Pronoella, Goniomya, and Pentacrinites, and there are a further 21 species too poorly preserved for description but likely to be new. Fifteen distinct faunal assemblages are recognised and named after the dominant species: Retroceramus cf. stehni, R. sp. C ?cf. galoi, Meleagrinella n. sp, Pterotrigonia thomsoni, Entolium spedeni, Neocrassina marwicki, N. ellsworthensis, Flabellirhynchia australensis, Pleuromya spp., Chariocrinus latadiensis, &#8216;Paracerithium&#8217; n. sp., Malayomaorica malayomaorica, M. occidentalis, Retroceramus sp. indet. D., and Blanfordiceras cf. wallichi. These characterise environments ranging from sublittoral to distal-shelf. Collectively, the fauna, taphonomic signatures, assemblages, sediments, and sedimentary structures record an increase in depth from inner- to mid-shelf settings in the Bajocian, through outer-mid shelf during the Kimmeridgian, to outer-shelf depths in the Tithonian. Hence, a general trend of decreasing energy and increasing depth through time is observed. Bathonian and Callovian strata are recognised for the first time in the Latady Formation and the presence of strata of Bajocian, Oxfordian, Kimmeridgian, and Tithonian age is further verified. Generic affinities of the fauna are Tethyan (e.g. aff. Cyathophylliopsis, Lopatinia, Oxytoma, Camptonectes, Pronoella, Anisocardia, Teloceras, Normannites, Perisphinctes, Cycleryon, Chariocrinus, Pentacrinites), whereas at specific level they are with coeval New Zealand faunas (e.g. Pinna n. sp, P. kawhiana, Oxytoma trechmanni, O. n. sp., Aucklandirhynchia cf. aucklandica, &#8216;Paracerithium&#8217; n. sp., Hibolithes aff. catlinensis, Belemnopsis aff. deborahae). South American affinities are also shown by the presence of Retroceramus cf. stehni, Pachysphinctes aff. americanensis, and Aspidoceras aff. euomphalum. Two influxes of Tethyan fauna to the &#8216;Bay of Antarctica&#8217; occurred in the Bajocian (e.g. Grammatodon sp., Oxytoma trechmanni, O. n. sp., Camptonectes grandis) and Callovian (e.g. aff. Cyathophylliopsis delabechei, Cucullaea (Idonearca) sp., Camptonectes auritus, Mesosaccella sp., Pronoella spp.) most likely through the Trans-Ethyraean Seaway. The migration route was a short-lived epicontinental seaway formed during transgressions. Apart from the migration of Tethyan taxa, no other evidence of eustatic cycle influence is seen in Latady sediments and the dominant control of relative sea-level was local tectonism. The widespread cephalopod-byssate bivalve biofacies occurs later in the Latady Formation than in other southern Gondwanan sequences, but once established dominates the entire Late Jurassic. Typical constituents of the biofacies present in the Latady Formation include Retroceramus n. sp. A., R. aff. galoi, R. sp. B ?cf. galoi, R. spp. indet. D, E, F, Malayomaorica malayomaorica, M. occidentalis, Hibolithes spp., Belemnopsis spp., Pachyduvalia spp., Pachysphinctes spp., Torquatisphinctes spp., Virgatosphinctes spp., and Kossmatia spp. Individual horizons change from bivalve dominated in the Kimmeridgian &#8211; Middle Tithonian to ammonite dominated in the latest Tithonian.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/286</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ascidians and sea hares: rich sources of Bioactive Natural Products</field><field name="creator">Appleton, David</field><field name="description">A survey of the metabolite content of fifty-two ascidians collected from New Zealand and Antarctica is presented. Using biological assays and reversed phase analytical C18 HPLC techniques, twenty-three specimens were selected for further work. Work on ten of the selected ascidians is presented in this study. Using standard chromatographic techniques combined with analytical C18 HPLC, eighteen metabolites were isolated of which sixteen exhibited biological activity. Ten of the eighteen metabolites were novel, with nine exhibiting biological activity. The New Zealand endemic ascidian Pycnoclavella kottae, collected from the Three Kings Islands yielded the novel 2,2,5-trisubstituted imidazol-4-ones, kottamides A - D (3.1 - 3.4). Three new pyridoacridines (4.80, 4.82, 4.84), along with two known pyridoacridines and the known benzopentathiepin, varacin were isolated from the New Zealand endemic ascidian Lissoclinum notti. Varacin was investigated for its use in ADEPT and a possible prodrug derivative was prepared. In addition, a novel biologically inactive purine, 8-oxo-1,3-dimethylisoguanine (6.29) was isolated from the New Zealand endemic ascidian Pseudodistoma cereum. The study of an ascidian of the genus Aplidium, collected from the Ross Sea, Antarctica resulted in the isolation of two novel quinone derivatives, rossinones A (5.71) and B (5.72), which exhibited potent cytotoxicity and antiviral activity. Rossinones A (5.71 ) and B (5.72) provide insights into the biosyntheses of several terrestrial plant natural products. In addition, six sea hares of three species collected from the Auckland, New Zealand region were surveyed using the same methodology, with three novel and seven known compounds being isolated. The study of the sea hare Aplysia dactylomela resulted in the isolation of two inactive novel tryptophan dipeptides, dactylamides A (7.9) and B (7.10), the known ink pigment aplysioviolin and four known sesquiterpenes. A new malyngamide, S (8.8) along with an algal toxin, lyngbyatoxin A and its acetate were isolated from the sea hare Bursatella leachii. A survey of nine algae collected from the same locations as the sea hares resulted in the identification of several of the dietary sources of these sea hares. Standard spectroscopic techniques were used for structural elucidation, including the use of natural abundance 1H-15N 2-D NMR where required. All compounds were assayed for a range of biological activities.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/290</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Marriage, Inheritance, and the Balance of Power in Twelfth-Century England and France</field><field name="creator">Diggelmann, Lindsay</field><field name="description">This project attempts to chart the importance of the social institutions of marriage and inheritance in giving rise to political change in England and France during the period 1100-1215. It benefits from the study of diverse primary sources that include chronicle histories, legal and financial documents, charters, diplomatic treaties, letters, and contemporary works of imaginative literature. It also takes into account the extensive secondary literature dealing with the period both in the area of historical research and in related fields such as anthropology, political science, and literary criticism. The thesis is broadly divided into two parts, with four chapters devoted to an extended analysis of major themes and a further four providing a narrative reading of the period to illustrate the ideas put forward. The central argument contends that a &#8216;multipolar&#8217; balance of power existed among the quasi-independent states under the nominal lordship of the kingdom of France (and also involving England) around 1100; that this arrangement was disrupted frequently in the following years so that by around 1200 any remaining balance was more &#8216;bipolar&#8217; in nature with the Plantagenet and Capetian kingdoms now dominating the smaller territorial units; and that the most important factors in creating this change were the political ramifications of marriage and inheritance episodes. The idea of a balance of power is developed and discussed by reference to similar ideas prevalent in the study of international relations among European states during the eighteenth century. To support the argument several chapters are devoted to a close examination of the social practices and restrictions surrounding marriage and inheritance during the twelfth century. Issues such as the need for consent between marriage partners, marital restrictions on the basis of consanguinity, and the prevalence of primogeniture in the handing down of estates are all discussed at length. A central theme is the contested and provisional nature of all these issues during the period, with rules that were either unclear or not universally accepted creating opportunities for political advancement by members of the social elite. Further, this thesis contends that earlier historiographical models describing a simple and consistent opposition between ecclesiastical leaders and lay magnates on questions of marriage are unrealistic. It looks to identify points of overlap and temporary alliance in secular and ecclesiastical policies, as well as noting the conflicts that occurred between them on other occasions. The project also aims to use the techniques and advantages of cultural history to add a significant extra dimension to the central political argument, by examining prevailing beliefs and value systems surrounding the institutions of marriage and inheritance.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/289</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Choosing your future : the role of ideas in managing trade-offs between economic and environmental objectives</field><field name="creator">Boven, Rick</field><field name="description">Environmental deterioration continues despite availability of policies and technologies that could reduce damage. Given the scale of human activity this creates a risk of environmental crisis. This thesis argues for revision of the dominant paradigm that provides the default assumptions used for theoretical and policy analysis that affects longterm economic and environmental outcomes. The paradigm extensions proposed include an environment that can be damaged by human activity, individuals with diverse beliefs and values, and an argument that the Earth is not yet in the industrial era but rather nearing the end of the transition to the industrial era. The proposed revised paradigm can be used to develop a theoretically sound strategy to reduce the risk of environmental crisis. The ideas-based strategy requires individuals to influence the beliefs and values of others to build support for government regulation and to establish norms to constrain damaging activity. The thesis argues that the paradigms and theories chosen by economists and other theorists are important influencers of economic and environmental outcomes.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/291</field></doc><doc><field name="title">SIMULATION OF COMPLEX MULTIPHASE, MULTI-COMPONENT, REACTING FLOWS IN POROUS MEDIA</field><field name="creator">Zarrouk, Sadiq J.</field><field name="description">In this study we are concerned with the modelling of multi-component, multiphase chemically reacting flows in porous media, with particular application to the spontaneous combustion of coal and the extraction of coalbed methane. These two related problems involve complex multiphase, multi-component flow in a porous medium. Chemical reactions, adsorption, gaseous diffusion and changes in porosity and permeability are important in one or both of these problems. These matters are discussed in general in the first few chapters of the thesis. Several models for the spontaneous combustion of coal that include the effect of a diminishing reaction rate are investigated and a new formulation in the form of a generic power law model is introduced. A numerical module for modelling the spontaneous combustion of coal is described, based on the TOUGH2 code. A new equation of state (EOS) module is developed including realistic physical properties for all gases involved. The modified version of TOUGH2 is used for modelling the adiabatic method for testing the reactivity of coal samples. The results agree very well with experimental measurements for coal samples from different mines in New Zealand and Australia. Moisture effect on the reaction rate was then introduced to TOUGH2 using a new twophase EOS module with water and air broken into its main components (Nitrogen, Oxygen, Carbon dioxide and Argon). Finally the production of methane from low rank coalbeds is investigated. A new EOS for mixture of water and methane is developed and incorporated into the TOUGH2 code to produce a new and versatile coalbed methane simulator. It is validated by running some simple test problems and comparing results with those obtained with the commercial COMET simulator.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/293</field></doc><doc><field name="title">When harey met Shakespeare : the genesis of the first part of Henry the Sixth</field><field name="creator">Vincent, Paul J.</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates the complex genesis of the play printed in the Shakespeare First Folio of 1623 as The first Part of Henry the Sixt. The Introduction identifies the tendency of previous scholars to minimise uncertainty in their chronological and authorship hypotheses for the play, and anchors the present study in the wider context of authorship theory and attribution studies. Chapters 1 and 2 examine the external and internal evidence for the play&#8217;s date, and deliberately avoid any speculation on its authorship in order to present the chronological evidence as objectively as possible. I demonstrate in Chapter 2 that it is only by carrying out a full structural analysis of the play that we can hope to disentangle and accurately appraise the various revision theories put forward by scholars over the centuries. Chapter 3 attempts, by means of a preliminary bibliographical analysis of the Folio text, to reconstruct the nature of the manuscript copy set into type by the Folio compositors. In Chapter 4 I conduct the first comprehensive assessment of Gary Taylor&#8217;s groundbreaking 1995 authorship hypothesis for the play and modify it significantly. The degree to which we are able to identify &#8216;who wrote what&#8217; in the play is the concern of Chapter 5, where I conclude that The first Part of Henry the Sixt is Shakespeare&#8217;s revision of the play that appears in Philip Henslowe&#8217;s Diary as &#8216;harey the vj&#8217;; a play written by Thomas Nashe (Act 1) and an anonymous playwright (Acts 2&#8211;5) for Lord Strange&#8217;s company and first performed at the Rose theatre on 3 March 1592.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/294</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Pedagogy of Graduate Supervision : Figuring the Relations between Supervisor and Student</field><field name="creator">Grant, Barbara M.</field><field name="description">The supervision of graduate research students is a pedagogy under pressure. Increasingly, in neo-liberal universities, it is subject to regulation and surveillance as well as stringencies of time and intensified expectations. Yet it is an elusive pedagogy, one that has not been much theorised. This is the field that my thesis is situated within. Through a series of small studies, I explore the &#8216;and&#8217; that relates &#8216;supervisor and student&#8217; in order to shed some light on the &#8220;unstated ethics&#8221; (jagodzinski, 2002, p.81) that shape how they act towards each other in supervision&#8217;s enclosed space. In the course of my enquiry, I critically engage with several dimensions of supervision: the public discourses that give it intelligibility, the layers of social relations that come into play, the meanings offered by a university&#8217;s code of practice, and those made by supervisors and students in an empirical study of several masters-level supervision pairs in the Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences. The main methodology used is a form of textual analysis that rests on an understanding of the slipperiness and ambiguity of texts and the inevitable partiality of interpretation. The mode of &#8216;knowing&#8217; offered here is one of reading and re-reading supervision through a series of figurative rather than literal accounts, none of which is intended to offer the last word on this complex pedagogy. Reckoned together, the interpretations offered here &#8211; supervision as a discursive object, as a palimpsest-like field of triangular relations, as a project of governmentality, as a fantasy, as the relation of Master-Slave, and as improvisation &#8211; give an overarching sense of supervision as a messy and unpredictable pedagogy in which the academic and the personal come together in an unusual way. The significance of this understanding is that we cannot easily or meaningfully regulate or &#8216;train&#8217; for supervision. Because of its implication in the production of original, independent academic work and the authorised academic subject, it must be as much a practice of improvisation as it is of regularity.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/295</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sport-related injury: prediction, prevention, and rehabilitation - a psychological approach</field><field name="creator">Maddison, Ralph</field><field name="description">Two interrelated studies were performed to examine the role of psychological factors in the prediction and prevention of sport-related injury. As far as injury prediction is concerned, Study 1 tested the Williams and Andersen (1998) revised stress-injury model. It was hypothesised through the model that athletes with a history of stressors, a shortage of coping resources, and personality dispositions that augment the stress response, would be the most vulnerable to injury. Four-hundred and seventy-rugby players from 37-teams participated in the study and completed measures corresponding to variables in the Williams and Andersen stress-injury model at the beginning of the playing season. The number of injuries sustained and the amount of time loss due to injury were recorded throughout the season. Data were analysed using product moment correlations between life-stress and injury for groups of participants who fell in the upper and lower third of the moderator variables (i.e., coping resources&#8212;type of coping and social support, history of stressor&#8212;previous injury, and personality&#8212;competitive anxiety) distributions. As expected, a mild positive relationship was found between life-stress and injury time loss (r = .09, p &lt; .05) and number of injuries sustained (r = .11, p &lt; .05). Results also showed that previous injury, the type of coping, social support, and competitive anxiety interacted in a conjunctive fashion to produce a maximum moderator effect (explaining up to 29% of the injury variance). A second study (Study 2) was performed to determine whether a stress management intervention programme could effectively reduce injury among athletes identified from Study 1 to be most vulnerable to injury. A second purpose was to examine what might explain a positive result by exploring psychological (i.e., coping and anxiety) and stress response (i.e., reaction time and perceptual sensitivity) variables. Fifty-one rugby players from Study 1 who were found to be most vulnerable to injury (i.e., a rugby player with many recent life-stresses, high competition anxiety, inappropriate coping skills, and a history of previous injury) were recruited and randomly assigned to either an intervention (stress management programme) or a control condition. Participants completed psychological inventories at the beginning (Time 1) and end (Time 2) of the 2002 rugby season. Prospective and objective injury data were obtained for both number of injuries and time loss. In addition, a purpose built apparatus was used to assess stress response variables at the beginning (Time 1) and end (Time 2) of the 2002 rugby season. Prior to the start of the 2002 rugby season participants in the intervention group started a 6-session stress management programme that lasted 4-consecutive weeks. Emphasis was placed on how athletes could modify their reaction to stress. Participants were contacted monthly to reinforce the intervention, discuss implementation of the skills, and any relevant issues. ANCOVA results showed a significant condition (control versus intervention) effect for total time missed, but not for number of injuries sustained. Participants in the stress management intervention reported missing less time due to injury at the end of the 2002 season compared to their non-intervention counterparts. Furthermore, the intervention group appeared to only marginally increase the amount of time missed in 2002 compared to 2001, whereas the control group missed significantly more time due to injury. ANCOVA results provided some insight into the potential reasons for injury reduction. For the psychological variables, a significant condition effect was found for total coping resources. The intervention group showed an increase in the amount of coping resources at Time 2 compared to Time 1, and showed greater coping resources than did the control group at Time 2. The intervention group also showed a decrease in worry at Time 2 compared to Time 1 and less worry than the control group at Time 2. The condition effect for concentration disruption (CD) approached statistical significance, with the intervention group showing less CD at Time 2 compared to the control group at Time 2. For the stress response variables no significant condition effects were found for reaction times or perceptual sensitivity (d&#8217;). Overall, results support the recommendation that a stress management programme is effective in preventing further time loss due to injury for athletes with an &#8220;at-risk&#8221; injury profile. This result in part, is due to these athletes increasing their coping skills, and decreasing their worry and concentration disruption cognitions. In an extension of the prediction and prevention studies, a third study was conducted to examine the effectiveness of a psychological intervention (modelling) in affecting rehabilitation outcomes. Specifically the purpose of Study 3 was to investigate whether a coping modelling intervention could decrease pre-operative anxiety and perceptions of expected pain, as well as increasing rehabilitation self-efficacy and motivation associated with surgical reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACLR). A second purpose was to determine whether the modelling intervention would be associated with improved functional outcomes in the early post-operative period (6-weeks) following ACLR. Sixty-four patients undergoing arthroscopic ACLR were randomised to receive a coping modelling intervention or to act as a control. Participants completed psychological inventories at different time periods during a 6-week period. In addition, the following functional outcomes were assessed, days walking with crutches, range of motion (ROM), and International Knee Documentation Committee assessment (IKDC). ANCOVA results revealed a significant condition effect for perceptions of expected pain, but not for state anxiety. Significant group differences were found for crutch self-efficacy, with the intervention group reporting greater self-efficacy than the control group. Repeated measure ANOVA results revealed significant time x condition effects for walking self-efficacy and exercise self-efficacy. No condition effect was found for jogging self-efficacy, nor were there any condition effects found for the motivation variables. ANCOVA results showed a significant condition effect (modelling) for functional outcome improvements (IKDC scores and crutch use) with the intervention group reporting superior IKDC scores and fewer days walking with crutches. No effects were found for ROM. Collective findings from the three studies highlight the importance of psychological factors in the prediction, prevention, and rehabilitation of athletic-related injury. Moreover, studies 2 &amp; 3 support the use of psychological based interventions for reducing injury and augmenting traditional rehabilitation outcomes. Opportunities for future research are discussed.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/296</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Semiparametric maximum likelihood for multi-phase response-selective sampling and missing data problems</field><field name="creator">Jiang, Yannan</field><field name="description">Missing data is a common occurrence in most medical (or other) research data collection processes. Missing data patterns can be sometimes caused by design. In multi-phase response-selective sampling, the response variable Y and some easily-obtainable variables are fully observed for a first-phase sample or finite population. Some of the covariates of interest, X, which might be difficult or too expensive to obtain, are then observed at later phases for smaller subsamples. The selection of data at each phase is dependent on the categorical information of Y , with the choice of considering other fullyobserved discrete variables as a cross- or post-stratification. In this thesis, we start from the simple case-control study in which the data are collected under a two-phase response-selective sampling scheme. Special conditions are considered subsequently to pose different questions of interest. In a secondary study, we may be interested in another binary response variable Y2, which is associated with the original case-control response Y in the data. Conventional logistic regression analysis can no longer provide consistent parameter estimates in this case. We also consider the situation in which the case-control status of each subject is actually defined by dichotomising a continuous variable which is potentially available in the population. Ignoring this source of information as in binary logistic regression typically results in a loss of efficiency which may be substantial. Linear regression analysis can be carried out to efficiently estimate the logistic model odds-ratios and their 95% confidence intervals. The behaviour of various methods of analyses and sampling strategies for linear models are also discussed. We finally consider three-phase response-selective sampling designs, methods of analyses and some applications of three-phase methods. Our main approach for data analysis is semiparametric maximum likelihood. Survey-weighted methods, as well as other semiparametric approaches, are also considered for comparison. Their relative efficiencies and robustness properties are investigated using a wide range of simulation studies and real data analyses. The major conclusions for each type of analyses are as follows. When we have correlated bivariate outcomes in case-control studies, both the semiparametric maximum likelihood (SPML) method with joint modeling of bivariate responses, and the simple weighted method for the model of interest, can be used. The SPML method is often substantially more efficient than the weighted method, but subject to bias in estimating parameters of interest when its nuisance models have been misspecified. The weighted method needs no nuisance models and thus is robust in this regard, but we cannot tell when it&#8217;s going to be very inefficient without sophisticated modeling as through the SPML method. We suggest to use both at this situation. Conclusions borne out by both types of analyses are particularly credible. For the type of case-control studies in which the binary response is potentially available as, or categorised from a continuous variable, a linear regression analysis with logistic error distribution using this continuous variable as the response is suggested. The results can be easily coverted into estimates of binary regression parameters with substantially higher efficiency. When such linear regression analyses are of particular interest, both the twophase SPML method and the weighted method (with small modifications) are used to analyse data arising from various two-phase sampling designs. Introducing extra stratification in sampling as well as in the analysis can substantically increase efficiencies of both methods in estimating parameters of X strongly associated with a variable defining strata (say V). The SPML method is always efficient compared with the weighted method. Differences in efficiency are most noticeable under response-selective sampling, which is, however, precisely where the SPML method is least robust under error model misspecification. The weighted method is robust in this regard when a logistic error distribution is used, and also reasonably efficient under Vconditional sampling. We finally consider three-phase response-selective sampling and have developed appropriate three-phase SPML method to obtain efficient and consistent parameter estimates under arbitrary regression models. As a natural extention to Scott and Wild&#8217;s two-phase SPML method, this approach is always efficient compared with other semiparametric approaches. Its drawbacks are its complexity and its slow convergence in some situations. This can be simplified, however, in case-control studies using logistic regression analysis. Although a general introduction to the missing data literature is given in the first chapter, in this thesis, we deal only with some very structured problems which are versions of the multi-phase sampling problems discussed in Section 1.2. The survey of the broader field of missing data is given to put the work done here in its wider context. Happenstance missing values in example data are directly deleted for simplicity. More sophisticated methods for missing data could be used but would require further methodological development and therefore not be considered in this thesis.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/297</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Personal practical theories : exploring the role of language teacher experiences and beliefs in the integration of theory and practice</field><field name="creator">Feryok, Anne</field><field name="description">The dominant model of teaching has shifted from a transmission model to an interpretive model with a concomitant focus on the role of teacher experiences and beliefs. This topic is explored from the perspective of six English as a Foreign Language teachers in Armenia. These teachers originally trained in Soviet and post-Soviet Armenia with a transmission model of teaching with a strong emphasis on grammar and translation. They later completed a threeterm Teaching English as a Foreign Language Certificate programme at a Western-sponsored graduate university in Armenia with a more interpretive model of teaching with a strong communicative language teaching orientation. The main research questions are: (1) How do EFL teachers develop personal practical theories? (2) What are the influences that shape personal practical theories? (3) To what extent are personal practical theories reflected in classroom practices? Interpretive analysis of e-mail interviews, classroom observations, and in-person interviews reveals that a variety of experiences and beliefs inform personal practical theories, including formal pedagogical education, personal experiences of language learning and teaching, personal beliefs and values, and the sociocultural context. Theory has several important roles to play in personal practical theories: it can offer explanations of experiences and practices as well as articulations of them, and it can offer directions for practices as well as hypotheses to test. Uptake of theory occurs through transmission, application, and critical reflection, all requiring interpretation. Classroom practices often, but not always, reflect personal practical theories. More experienced and more articulate teachers appear to have more coherent personal practical theories that are more consistently reflected in classroom practices. There are several implications for language teacher education programmes. Theory has a role to play in language teacher development. Teachers who voluntarily choose to engage in development are more likely to profit from it. Teachers need to become aware of what they do and don&#8217;t know. Teachers need to be autonomous in order to successfully adopt new practices. A professional community offers support to teachers. These implications are linked through a view of the teacher as an autonomous individual able to understand theory and practice as evidenced by the ability to articulate and integrate them in a personal practical theory reflected in effective classroom practices.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/298</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Globalisation and Pluri-scalar Orchestrations in Higher Education: Locating The University of Auckland's  Student Learning Centre Historically and Globally</field><field name="creator">van Rij-Heyligers, Josta Arlene</field><field name="description">Globalisation is a dominant theme in today&#8217;s discourse of educational and social politics, but its dimensions and forces are not well understood. Generally, Globalisation suggests that in meeting international pressures a nation state is less able to act. With diminished state control, the devolution and privatisation of the public sector are seen as solutions for states to operate in a global market. This thesis suggests that changes in New Zealand educational policy since 1984 show that far from weakening the authority of the state, its position has been strengthened through neoliberal policies creating quasimarkets and new forms of public management in the state sector. This thesis takes neoliberalism as the current manifestation of a world-system of capitalism in crisis, and synthesises historical socio-political approaches to globalisation and economic wave theory into a theoretical framework from which educational policies at the multiple levels of authority (transnational, national and institutional) are examined. Apart from a focus on the structural attributes impinging on reform, the thesis also argues that the global discourses of the knowledge economy and of building a nation&#8217;s human capital through increased private investment, as well as the state&#8217;s continued capacity to &#8216;mediate&#8217; the expansion of capitalism constitute the driving forces for the reshaping of the tertiary educational system in New Zealand under the fourth Labour Government and the National-led governments that followed. The impact of global dictates and the tertiary education reforms (1984-2000) in New Zealand on the mandate, delivery, and form of governance of university education is illustrated through the transformations the University of Auckland and its Student Learning Centre have experienced. However, this thesis contends that path-dependency, such as university traditions and culture, affects the way global dictates and state policies are accepted, contested, or translated in a manner consonant with institutional objectives. Yet, it is also suggested that the external pressure of reduced public funding and state regulations promoting a quasi-market environment in higher education pose perhaps the greatest threat to traditional notions of academic autonomy and collegiality built on cooperation and sharing of ideas. It is further shown that the climate of efficiency and rationality advanced during the period 1984-2000 has limited the scope of what is taught, how it is taught and why it is taught. Even though the thesis indicates that the number of programmes and subjects have increased as more students continue their education, the function of universities has narrowed: providing consumer choice and instrumental value for building the &#8216;elusive&#8217; knowledge economy. The thesis expresses concern that if this trend continues the community role of universities will be impeded and teaching will become more pragmatic and technocratic.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/299</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physical activity and fitness measures in New Zealand : a study of validation and correlation with cardiovascular risk factors</field><field name="creator">Moy, Karen</field><field name="description">The primary aim of the study was to validate the short and long form of the recently-created NZ physical activity questionnaires (NZPAQ-SF and NZPAQ-LF, respectively) in a multi-ethnic sample in Auckland. An international physical activity questionnaire (IPAQ-long) was also validated and compared to the NZ instruments. Objective PA measures were used to create a NZ compendium of PA intensities, providing baseline data for culturally-specific PAs. Secondary aims included an examination of the relationship between PA and CRF, and their associations with cross-sectional measures of cardiovascular (CV) risk factors. The study sample consisted of 186 apparently healthy males (n=90) and females (n=96) aged 19-86 yrs, classified as European/Other (n=60), M&#257;ori (n=61), and Pacific (n=65). Heart rate monitoring (HRM) with individual calibration was used to objectively measure the duration, frequency, and intensity of at least moderate-intensity PAs performed over 3 consecutive days. Type of PA and the context in which it was performed was simultaneously recorded by participants on daily PA logs. Correlations between HRM and self-reported levels of brisk walking, moderate-intensity, vigorousintensity, were poor for each questionnaire, and correlations were lower for M&#257;ori and Pacific ethnic groups than for European/Other. The NZPAQ-SF (r=0.3, p&lt;0.001) and NZPAQ-LF (r=0.3, p&lt;0.001) performed better than the IPAQ-long (r=0.1, p=0.37). The culturally-specific list of PA intensities showed strong correlation (R2=0.68) to an internationally-accepted compendium of PA intensities, and provided baseline energy cost data for 13 PAs performed by M&#257;ori and Pacific people in NZ. CRF levels were primarily influenced by gender, ethnicity, obesity, and performing at least 15 min/day of vigorous-intensity PA, and showed stronger associations with fasting blood lipids and glucose, while PA was more strongly related to SBP and DBP. The validated NZPAQs are acceptable for measuring population level PA prevalence in NZ adults, although accuracy is lower for M&#257;ori and Pacific people. However, the availability of a culturallyspecific list of PA intensities could potentially increase the accuracy of self-reported PA by M&#257;ori and Pacific people. Results from this study highlight the importance of vigorous-intensity PA for CV health, and identifies NZ Pacific people as high risk in terms of PA, obesity, and CRF.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321200 Public Health and Health Services::321207 Indigenous health</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/305</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Interactions of oxygenated organic molecules on the (111) surfaces of a uranium dioxide single crystal</field><field name="creator">Chong, Shen Vun</field><field name="description">This study involves the first investigation into the interactions, both the chemical pathways and adsorption behaviour, of a primary alcohol, carboxylic acids, aldehydes, and a ketone on the surfaces of a UO2(111) single crystal under ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) conditions. The surfaces of the uranium dioxide single crystal were characterised via AES (Auger electron spectroscopy), LEED (low energy electron diffraction), and XPS (X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy), while the thermal chemistry was investigated via TPD (temperature programmed desorption) experiments. Thermal reactions of organic acids (i.e. ethanol, formic acid, acetic acid, and propionic acid) over the stoichiometric surface of UO2(111) were found to highly favour the dehydration route. In particular, TPD of acetic acid showed that nearly 85 % of the adsorbed acetates were converted to ketene. This is due to the intrinsic properties of UO2, in which its bulk Madelung potential (high) indicates an acidic character (in general acidic oxides tend to dehydrate, while basic oxides tend to dehydrogenate the reactants). Over the reduced surfaces of UO2(111) single crystal, several C&#8211;C coupling products were observed from surface aldehyde species (created from direct dosing or during thermal reactions). The most pronounced is the reductive carbonyl coupling reactions in forming alkenes due to the presence of surface defect sites. Aldehydes (and ketone) that possess ahydrogen also exhibited the ability to &#8220;aldol-condense&#8221; to form higher a,b-unsaturated aldehydes (for example the formation of crotonaldehyde from acetaldehyde). Furthermore, trimeric condensation reactions were also observed from acetaldehyde and acetone TPDs, in which benzene and 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene were respectively formed. The adsorption behaviour of several organic compounds under investigation were also studied via dynamic AES and/or LEED over the polar oxygen terminated UO2(111) surface (stoichiometric). Based on the measured sticking coefficients and TPD experiments, the ease of adsorption of the molecules was found to be governed by the polarity (and acidity) of the molecules, and followed the trend of carboxylic acids &gt; alcohols &gt; aldehydes.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/306</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Writing on the margins : the experimental poetry of Lyn Hejinian, Yang Lian and Arkadii Dragomoshchenko</field><field name="creator">Edmond, Jacob</field><field name="description">This study assesses macroanalytic theories of global aesthetics that propose a strong correlation between artistic innovation and social, political, economic and technological conditions. The assessment is carried out through substantial new microanalytic research on the social situation, poetry and artistic intentions of Lyn Hejinian, Yang Lian &#26954;&#29001; and Arkadii Dragomoshchenko, three experimental poets whose work pushed the boundaries of poetry within their respective countries, the United States, China and the Soviet Union, from the late 1970s to the early 1990s. Existing macroanalytic theories predict that these poets should be very different because they worked in contrasting conditions, but the microanalysis shows that there are remarkable points of correlation. The three major characteristics that the poets share are: an interest in lyric poetry as an exploration of consciousness and a closely connected though contradictory interest in language as a self-sufficient medium; the use of difficulty in poetry with an intent that is both utopian and anti-utopian; the production of poetry that was intended to provide an alternative to mainstream poetic discourse, and the association of this poetic experimentation with a way of life that was intended to provide an alternative to mainstream society. These findings undermine prevailing theorizations of the globalization of poetry and thus point to the need for a reconfiguration of theories of global aesthetics. This study employs an innovative approach that makes significant contributions to research at three levels of analysis. Firstly, it provides in-depth single-author studies of three difficult poets, based on substantial new close readings and statements of poetics in the original languages, and including valuable bibliographical material. Secondly, it presents social-context analysis of the place of experimental poetry in the United States, China and the Soviet Union, based on sociological and historical research. Thirdly, it offers a comparative, contrastive analysis, which calls into question prevailing theorizations of the way experimental poetry is developing in the context of globalization. This inquiry is built around new close readings of two works that are centrally important to the oeuvre of each writer over the period examined: The Guard (1984) and Oxota (1991) by Hejinian; &#8220;Nuorilang&#8221; &#35582;&#26085;&#26391; (Norlang) (1983) and &#8220;Banpo&#8221; &#21322;&#22369; (1984) by Yang; and &#8220;Summa Elegii&#8221; (Sum of Elegies) (1986) and &#8220;Nasturtsiia kak real'nost'&#8221; (Nasturtium as Reality) (1986) by Dragomoshchenko.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/308</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Corporate governance in China</field><field name="creator">Fu, Jiang</field><field name="description">This thesis addresses some important issues in corporate governance using data from Chinese stock markets. The thesis starts with a summary of relevant research in the area of corporate governance. Next, I describe the historic development of corporate governance in China and the corporate governance framework that is currently in place. These two introductory chapters are followed by my empirical research, which comprises three chapters. First, I analyse share price reactions and top-management turnover around announcements of negotiated block transfers between different State-ownership structures for a sample of State-controlled firms that are publicly traded on Chinese stock exchanges. I find that changes in firm value and CEO turnover are much greater when a government agency (GA) transfers a block of shares of a listed firm to a statecontrolled enterprise with a private joint venture partner (LPSOE) rather than to a solely state owned enterprise (SSOE). Second, using a sample of listed firms that issued debt guarantees to their large shareholders, I analyse the relation between firm- and ownership characteristics and the probability of expropriation of minority shareholders by controlling shareholders. I also analyse and validate the assumed relationship between &#8216;tunnelling&#8217; and several financial measures of expropriation suggested in the literature. I find that, in a weak legal environment such as China, the issuance of related guarantees is more likely at firms with large private blockholders than at firms with the State as the largest blockholder, and that related guarantees are more likely at larger firms and firms with a single controlling blockholder. I also find that firms that issued related loan guarantees have significantly lower industry-adjusted measures of Tobin&#8217;s Q, profitability, and dividend yields and have significantly higher leverage. This evidence is consistent with the hypothesis that tunnelling by controlling shareholders can be very costly to minority shareholders. I find no evidence of higher bid ask spreads for firms that issued related guarantees. Finally, I study the monitoring role of blockholders in China as an alternative mechanism of corporate governance that might result in reduced expropriation of firm assets by the controlling blockholder. I find that non-controlling block holders contribute to firm value only when their ultimate owners are different from the controlling blockholder in terms of the public/private distinction. I attribute this result to the potential conflict of interests between controlling and non-controlling block holders in this case, reducing the opportunities to tunnel and improving monitoring of management. I also provide evidence of a substantial valuation discount if there are clear signals that suggest collusion between blockholders.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/309</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The formation and fate of carbonyl sulfide (COS) gas in aluminium smelting</field><field name="creator">Hay, Suzanne Jill</field><field name="description">Carbonyl sulfide (COS) gas is emitted from aluminium smelters at concentrations of 1 &#8211; 8 ppmv or 0.2 &#8211; 1.6 kgt-1 Al produced. While COS emissions are relatively small compared to emissions of HF or SO2, previous measurements suggest that COS is not efficiently captured in the scrubbing systems used by aluminium smelters and it has been suggested that the industry is a significant anthropogenic emitter of COS. COS is a unique sulfur gas in the atmosphere, due to its stability, lifetime of several years and implication in ozone depletion. The source of COS and other sulfur gases from aluminium smelters, is the 1 &#8211; 4 mass% S content of anodes, consumed during aluminium electrolysis. These anodes are primarily made from petroleum coke, a low value and therefore high sulfur product, of crude oil refining. This thesis examines aspects of the formation and fate of COS in aluminium reduction cells. One thesis objective was to confirm the nature of sulfur species present in petroleum cokes and anodes. A XANES (X-ray Absorption Near Edge Structure) spectroscopy study of cokes from the major suppliers and anode core samples showed that organic sulfur containing ring structures were the dominant sulfur species, before and after anode baking and even after significant desulfurisation at 1500&#186;C. Thermodynamic calculations performed using the HSC Chemistry&#169; computer package agreed with previous smelter measurements that COS gas was the dominant sulfur gas to form at the anode face and SO2 became the dominant sulfur gas after the anode gases left the cell and mixed with an induced air draft in the cell hooding. Previous smelter measurements showed that some COS (about 5 ppmv) did survive through the cell ducting into the dry scrubber and that there were only negligible reductions in COS concentration after dry scrubbing. The dry scrubber contains smelter-grade alumina, which adsorbs HF and other smelter gases, before the alumina is recycled to the cells. Another objective of this thesis was to study the effect dry scrubbing had on COS emissions in greater detail in the laboratory to better understand any reactions that may be occurring. A thermodynamic analysis using HSC Chemistry&#169; determined that alumina would reduce the stability of COS at a typical dry scrubbing temperature of 80&#186;C. The dry scrubber was modelled in the laboratory using an alumina containing fluidised bed reactor, with the inlet and outlet gas composition monitored using mass spectrometry. Adsorbed species resulting from COS adsorption on alumina were studied separately using DRIFTS (Diffuse Reflectance Infrared Fourier Transform Spectroscopy). Experiments showed that COS was stable in the fluidised bed apparatus in isolation. The presence of smelter-grade alumina led to the adsorption of COS in its molecular form and as adsorbed hydrogen thiocarbonate. The latter species is believed to be an intermediate in the hydrolysis of COS into H2S on alumina. The effect of conditions which may vary in the dry scrubbing system, such as humidity, SO2 and HF concentrations, were studied. The presence of optimum humidity levels ensured sustained hydrolysis of COS over several hours, but adsorbed SO2 and HF interfered with COS conversion. This suggests that COS hydrolysis would be unlikely to occur to a great extent in commercial dry scrubbers used in the aluminium smelter industry.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/310</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An exploratory study of the interplay between teachers&#8217; beliefs, instructional practices &amp; professional development</field><field name="creator">Mohamed, Naashia</field><field name="description">Previous research has revealed the influential role of teachers&#8217; beliefs in determining their professional behaviour. Teachers&#8217; beliefs affect not only their teaching, but also filter new input, suggesting significant implications for the implementation of educational innovations and teacher development. This study explores the interconnections between teachers&#8217; beliefs, their instructional practices and professional development, examining the extent to which the introduction of an innovative teaching approach impacts teachers&#8217; beliefs and behaviour. It focuses particularly on grammar instruction in the context of English teaching in secondary schools of the Maldives. Combining descriptive ethnography with a quasi-experimental design, the study was implemented in two phases. Phase One, based on questionnaire data from 197 teachers from 51 schools, explored teachers&#8217; beliefs and their self reported practices. Findings indicated that teachers placed great emphasis on grammar and that they were unfamiliar with inductive approaches to grammar instruction. In Phase Two, inductive grammar teaching methods were introduced to 14 teachers from two schools, in a 12 week professional development programme. Drawing largely on data from observations and interviews, the results from this phase showed that although teachers were observed to generally follow their pedagogic beliefs, several points of difference between their beliefs and practices existed. While the professional development may have increased their understanding of inductive approaches to grammar instruction at the level of awareness, only limited changes to beliefs and practices were observed. Changing instructional practice appeared to be a difficult task with only two teachers uptaking the innovation. Some subsidiary changes were however observed in the practices of several other teachers. Various impediments constrained change efforts, including teachers&#8217; lack of openness to change, their low professional motivation and the lack of a supportive school culture. Contextual factors such as large classes and difficult working conditions also negatively affected the change process. Findings indicate that development activities which provided regular one-on-one support for the teachers were more likely to lead to uptake than those involving mainly workshops. The individual nature of the uptake process, its lack of uniformity and the challenges faced by the teachers are discussed, as are the implications for the provision of professional development.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/311</field></doc><doc><field name="title">In what sense a fisheries problem? : negotiating sustainable growth in New Zealand fisheries</field><field name="creator">Rees, Eugene Bruce</field><field name="description">This thesis addresses the question of how seafood enterprises grow in a constrained resource economy and, specifically, examines the performance of New Zealand&#8217;s seafood sector since the introduction of the quota management system in 1986. It explores whether the quota management system and individual transferable quota have led to an increase in industry performance and competitiveness. Conventional theoretical arguments for the institution of quota management and transferable quota propose that re-regulation will lead to efficiency, and by implication, profitability gains for the seafood sector. A process-based methodological framework, utilising complementary methodological practices and triangulation using both qualitative and quantitative approaches is employed to examine New Zealand fishing enterprises across a number of scales. Forty subjects were formally interviewed throughout the fishing sector in Nelson, Marlborough, Wellington and Auckland. Informal ongoing conversations with many of the interview subjects, amongst others, in a number of fora (academic and industry conferences, wharves and dockside) also enriched the research. The thesis integrates ideas from political economy in order to begin to answer questions concerning the prospects for sustainability and development. The thesis is about what happens when we consider dimensions that are largely missing in the international literature on fisheries (the firm, region and communities, and territory, resources and markets). This thesis proposes that we must avoid treating quota management systems, individual transferable quota and associated property rights reforms as monolithic. Rather, New Zealand&#8217;s quota management system is geographically constituted and co-constructed by stakeholders who play ongoing and changing roles in an emergent dialogue concerning sustainable fisheries, fisheries management and commercial fishing in New Zealand. The thesis finds that volume and value of seafood has increased. However, this increase is largely at the expense of first foreign fishing companies and part-time fishermen, and later small independent fishermen. There has been a rationalisation of fishing effort allied with an increased emphasis in growing more product and more value through aquaculture and value-adding strategies. New geographies of production are emerging and some of these geographies may prove to be unsustainable. Lastly, firms that fish, and particularly quota owners, are actively inserting themselves into debates concerning sustainability, sustainable development and fisheries management in expected ways that have led to unintended and ongoing political and governmental reconfigurations of fisheries in New Zealand.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/312</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Buckling and growth of disbonds in honeycomb sandwich structure</field><field name="creator">Southward, Temoana</field><field name="description">The response of honeycomb sandwich structure to disbond damage, in a compressive stress field, has been assessed. Two types of disbond were considered; those extending through the full width of a panel (through-width) and those enclosed within the panel boundaries (embedded). For each type of disbond the failure process was established through four-point bend testing of 56 sandwich specimens. For both types of disbond, failure was found to be governed by buckling-driven disbond growth and, consequently, models of buckling and disbond growth were developed. All of the models decoupled the face-sheets of the sandwich and treated the core as a spring foundation having a stiffness determined from equilibrium of a two-dimensional orthotropic solid. A linear Winkler beam model was used to predict buckling of a through-width disbond. The model buckling loads agreed with specimen test results with an average difference of 1.7%. A non-linear Winkler beam model was then developed to predict post-buckling behaviour and the initiation of disbond growth, through a fracture mechanics analysis. A characteristic growth curve, defining the work input required to initiate disbond growth, was developed and agreed with specimen test results with an average difference of 3.3%. The model also verified that disbond growth occurs in discrete increments approximately equal to the diameter of the honeycomb cells. A linear Winkler plate model was used to predict buckling of an embedded disbond. The model buckling loads agreed with specimen test results with an average difference of 3.7%. A non-linear Winkler plate model was then developed to predict post-buckling behaviour of a sandwich panel containing an embedded disbond. The model considered contact conditions and modelled disbond growth by releasing fractured nodes during load incrementation. Disbond growth initiation loads agreed with specimen test results with an average difference of 15.8%. Failure loads consistently over-predicted specimen test results by an average of 13.9%. It was concluded that the growth initiation loads should be used as a conservative estimate of failure. The models developed may be used to assess the criticality of disbond damage in sandwich structure having thin-gauge, composite face-sheets.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/313</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterisation of Poly (ethylene naphthalate)-based polymer blends</field><field name="creator">Jung, Dylan D.

Ny66/PEN blends including several additives do not improve the miscibility of the constituent polymers and show lower tensile strength than those of homopolymers.  However, PBT/PEN blends reveal improved tensile strengths of the blends between the ROM and MROM predictions lines with more than 50 % volume fraction of PEN. On the other hand, NMR spectra show no evidence of interchange reaction in both Ny66/PEN and PBT/PEN blends.  SEM micrographs of fracture surfaces in PBT/PEN blends reveal a very small (sub-micron) domain size in contrast to large domains in Ny66/PEN blends, which indicates partial miscibility of PBT and PEN.  DSC and DMTA demonstrate partial miscibility of PBT/PEN blends by the change of Tgs of each component according to the weight proportions of the constituent polymers. Stress relaxation tests for the specimens of PBT/PEN blends and the homopolymers, using the Taguchi method of experimental design, determine that the most significant factor is the temperature, followed by PEN content and then the initial stress, and interaction effects between factors are insignificant.  To fit the relaxation curves of the PBT/PEN blends and the homopolymers at different temperatures, PEN contents and initial stresses, four different equations have been used.  The coefficients of the equation that fit best are used to predict the relaxation behaviour of PBT/PEN blends at a temperature between 30&#61616;C and 60&#61616;C, and at the initial stresses of 7 MPa.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Polymer blends</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290600 Chemical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/317</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Geology, geochemistry, and genesis of the El Pen&#771;o&#769;n epithermal Au-Ag deposit, northern Chile : characteristics of a bonanza-grade deposit and techniques for exploration</field><field name="creator">Warren, Patrick Ian</field><field name="description">The El Pe&#241;&#243;n gold-silver deposit comprises six epithermal veins, which contain a geologic resource (measured + indicated + inferred) of 3.8 million oz Au and 63 million oz Ag. The deposit is hosted in Paleocene and Eocene mafic to felsic volcanic rocks and is located in the central portion of the Paleocene metallogenic belt, 165 km southeast of Antofagasta. Older and younger igneous rocks occur in the district; Late Cretaceous and Eocene intermediate composition rocks record the effects of hydrothermal activity not related to precious metal mineralisation of the El Pe&#241;&#243;n deposit. Rocks in the district display two distinct types of hydrothermal alteration: widespread alteration associated with near-neutral pH, reduced fluid and localised alteration associated with acidic pH, oxidised fluid. Near-neutral pH, reduced fluid produced widespread replacement of phenocrysts and groundmass by quartz, adularia, albite, illite, chlorite, smectite, calcite, and pyrite; quartz-adularia alteration (replacement of primary phases, vein fillings, and hydrothermal breccia matrices) intensifies in the vicinity of precious metalbearing veins. Acidic pH, oxidised fluid produced lithocaps of massive quartz-alunite alteration, quartz-alunite cemented breccia, and, locally, weak Cu mineralisation above inferred Late Cretaceous and Eocene intrusions. Adularia from the two largest veins is dated at 52 to 53 Ma (40Ar/39Ar), indicating formation 1 to 3 m.y. later than host rhyolite domes. Quartz-alunite alteration spatially associated with Late Cretaceous and Eocene intermediate composition intrusive rocks is dated at 70-69 Ma and 50-49 Ma, respectively. Dating of supergene alunite indicates that weathering within a semi-arid to arid climate occurred from 23-17 Ma, prior to the onset of hyperaridity. The veins that comprise the El Pe&#241;&#243;n deposit range from &lt;0.5 m to 22 m wide; the bonanza-grade Quebrada Colorada vein has a strike length of ~2 km, vertical extent of ~500 m (1377-1877 m asl), and varies in width from 0.5 m to 4.5 m. Pervasive supergene oxidation extends to 400 m below surface. Limited drill intercepts at deeper levels consist of banded and brecciated quartz, adularia, and massive, bladed, and acicular, Ca-, Fe-, Mn-, and Mgbearing carbonate minerals, with minor amounts of pyrite, chalcopyrite, sphalerite, and galena. Veins exhibit a wide range of crustiform textures, including comb, colloform, and lattice quartz, rhombic adularia, and abundant massive and bladed Fe- and Mn-oxide minerals. Recrystallization textures suggest amorphous silica and chalcedony precursors for some quartz. Coexisting liquid- and vapor-rich inclusions, lattice textures, and vein adularia are evidence for boiling conditions that were likely responsible for Au-Ag deposition. Ore minerals observed in oxidised veins consist of electrum (mostly 40-60 wt % Au), acanthite, gold, silver, silver sulfosalts, silver halides, and rarely pyrite, chalcopyrite, and galena. High ore grades are generally associated with massive bands of fine-grained quartz and adularia, breccias composed of vein clasts in a matrix of fine-grained quartz and adularia, and, less commonly, colloform quartz bands. Supergene processes resulted in local remobilisation of Au and Ag, leaving nearly pure gold (up to 98 wt % Au) along fractures and associated with oxide masses. Fluid inclusion data from the El Pe&#241;&#243;n deposit indicate vein formation from low salinity (&lt;2 eq. wt % NaCl), boiling hydrothermal fluid at temperatures mostly from 230 to 260&#176;C. 18O values of quartz range from 5 to 8 per mil, which can be explained by boiling and cooling of a single parent liquid of probable meteoric origin. Comparison of the amount of Au and quartz contained in the Quebrada Colorada vein to mass fluxes in the Broadlands- Ohaaki geothermal system indicates that the vein could have formed in as little as a few thousand years. Abundant geochemical analyses (&gt;7000 surface samples and &gt;4000 drill hole samples) provide ample data with which to evaluate vectors to ore. Geochemical gradients in altered rocks surrounding veins in the El Pe&#241;&#243;n district indicate that Au, Ag, As, and Sb concentrations increase toward mineralised quartz veins. Geochemical analyses of altered rocks from drill holes surrounding the Quebrada Colorada vein show enrichment of Au and Ag and depletion of Ca, Na, and Sr toward the vein; As and Sb increase with elevation. Mass changes calculated using whole-rock geochemical data also show gradients that are centred on mineralised veins; K is typically enriched toward veins, whereas Na and Ca are depleted. Whole-rock geochemical data are used to evaluate hydrothermal alteration mineralogy so that gradients of mass change can be related to associated zoning of hydrothermal minerals.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/314</field></doc><doc><field name="title">General linear methods with inherent Runge-Kutta stability</field><field name="creator">Wright, William Matthew</field><field name="description">General linear methods were derived approximately thirty years ago as a unifying approach for the study of consistency, stability and convergence of the Runge-Kutta and the linear multistep methods. Their discovery opened the possibility of obtaining essentially new methods which were neither Runge-Kutta nor linear multistep methods nor slight variations of these methods. It was hoped that general linear methods would exist which are practical and have advantages over the traditional methods. Locating such practical methods has proved difficult though, for several reasons. For example, the complexity of the order conditions becomes very high, making it difficult to even find the required conditions in many cases let alone solve them. Several simplifying assumptions must be made, which limit this large class to situations where practical methods are likely to exist. The first assumption is that the stage order is equal to the overall order of the general linear method. This results in methods which, among other things, are not affected by the order reduction phenomenon. The second assumption is that a Nordsieck vector is passed from step to step. This enables such methods to vary the stepsize in a convenient and practical way. The final assumption is that the stability regions of the general linear methods should be identical to those of corresponding Runge-Kutta methods. The first two assumptions are satisfied by the structure of the U and V matrices of the general linear methods. In order to satisfy the last assumption sufficient conditions are developed. These conditions result in a class of general linear methods with a property known as inherent Runge- Kutta stability (IRKS). The IRKS conditions relate the coefficient matrices of the general linear method with a doubly companion matrix X to satisfy BA = XB, BU &#8801; XV - VX, &#963;(V) = {1,0}. Constructing general linear methods with the IRKS property in the most general way possible is the main aim of this thesis. To derive these methods a transformation is used; this transformation brings all methods of this class into a particular form, which allows the construction using only linear operations. Several special properties of methods with the IRKS property are introduced. For example, conditions which show that the ESIRK methods are a special case of the IRKS methods are introduced. This then allows the introduction of a new class of ESIRK methods which may have advantages over those already known. Also, methods which have a property known as strong stiff accuracy are developed which make them similar to strictly stable Runge-Kutta methods. Methods with strong stiff accuracy are likely to be considered good, particularly because they are the most suitable amongst the IRKS methods for the solution of differential algebraic equations. The theoretical properties of the general linear methods with IRKS are investigated using various implementations from fixed stepsize and fixed order to variable stepsize and variable order codes. The IRKS methods are experimentally compared with several traditional methods, which provides evidence that the IRKS methods may in fact be suitable to form the kernel of an efficient solver of ordinary differential equations.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/315</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Aspects of the ecology of forest invertebrates and the use of Brodifacoum</field><field name="creator">Craddock, Paul</field><field name="description">Brodifacoum is a potent second-generation anti-coagulant toxin routinely used to control problem populations of introduced mammalian pests (such as possums (Trichosurus vulpecula), rats (Rattus rattus) and mice (Mus musculus) in New Zealand forests. The toxin is packaged in the form of cereal bait pellets, which are distributed into managed forest locations in bait stations or by aerial drops. The toxin is persistent in vertebrate tissues, and there has been increasing concern recently about the potential for secondary poisoning of threatened insectivorous bird species via invertebrates that have fed on bait containing brodifacoum. This thesis studied relevant aspects of the ecology of forest invertebrates and the use of brodifacoum bait at Trounson Kauri Park, Katui Scenic Reserve and Wenderholm Regional Park, North Island, New Zealand. Video recording equipment was used to monitor invertebrate activity at bait stations, revealing that weta (Orthoptera) and cockroaches (Blattodea) were significant users of bait stations loaded with brodifacoum bait. These animals were attracted to full bait stations, and could spend considerable time in contact with toxic bait. Weta were even observed grazing poison baits. Pitfall traps, &#8216;weta boxes&#8217; and rodent tracking tunnels were used to sample the invertebrate populations in the three study areas. Wetas and beetles were present in significantly greater numbers at Trounson and Wenderholm compared to Katui. It was concluded that this difference was due to the reduction in pest mammal populations, resulting from the intensive pest control at the two former sites. Invertebrates captured in pitfall traps were sent for brodifacoum residue analysis to determine if brodifacoum was present in their tissues. Weta, cockroaches, beetles and other miscellaneous invertebrate species recorded significant residues of brodifacoum (up to 7.47 &#181;g/g). Residues were found to be dependent on the loading of toxic bait into stations. Levels recorded after bait was loaded were significantly higher than levels recorded before bait was loaded in bait stations. Invertebrates carrying brodifacoum were found to disperse up to 10 metres from the source of the toxin (loaded bait stations). Residue levels recorded decreased significantly the further away from the full bait stations that samples were taken. After toxic bait had been removed from bait stations, residue levels in invertebrates took in excess of 4 weeks to return to background levels. Trace levels of brodifacoum were still detectable up to 10 weeks after bait had been removed. Physiological experiments on the effect of brodifacoum consumption on captive locusts found no evident harmful effects. Locusts fed readily on toxic bait with no significant increase in mortality. They excreted brodifacoum rapidly, and there was no evidence of long-term bio-accumulation of the toxin. A risk assessment was made exploring the potential for invertebrates to secondarily poison insectivorous bird species. This found that bird species that consume substantial numbers of weta, cockroaches and beetles (eg. kiwi (Apteryx spp), ruru (Ninox novaeseelandiae) and robin (Petroica australis)) are at risk of secondary poisoning from their food supply during pest control operations using brodifacoum. The risk is higher during and immediately after bait containing brodifacoum is loaded in bait stations. Risks decreases progressively after bait is removed, as invertebrates excrete any brodifacoum residues present in their tissues. The risk of secondary poisoning is likely to be greater during warmer months, due to increased invertebrate activity (and residues in invertebrates) during this time. The frequency of consumption of contaminated invertebrates by birds was also determined to affect risk of secondary poisoning. A series of management recommendations are made to reduce risks of secondary poisoning when using brodifacoum for pest control in New Zealand.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/316</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Neglected Offender: Exploring the Role of Executive Dysfunction in Violent Offending</field><field name="creator">Crump, Sheree A</field><field name="description">Executive dysfunction and aggression and violence have been consistently associated in the research literature over at least the last 50 years. Some literature documents profound behaviour changes and the development of antisocial traits after changes to the prefrontal cortex and it&#8217;s supporting neural networks. Other research makes tentative links using brain imaging and neuropsychological methods. Prefrontal dysfunction can lead to executive dysfunction, and executive dysfunction may constitute a pathway to violence. Robust demonstrations of the association between executive function and violence have been limited by poor methodology in previous studies. This study attempts to address methodological concerns and uses a neuropsychological battery to examine the role of the executive functions in the expression of violence through violent offending. It is hypothesised that problems with executive functioning as measured by a neuropsychological battery may be linked to violent offending through impulsivity and disinhibition. Two studies were completed with sixty participants across the two groups. In the first study three groups of men were assessed on tests of executive dysfunction; 21 inmates convicted of violent crimes; 16 inmates convicted of non-violent crimes; and a matched control sample of 16 men in the community who are conviction free. Results demonstrate a positive relationship between executive dysfunction and violent offending. A similar association was demonstrated between the length of formal education each participant across the sample reported, with less years of education increasing the likelihood of participants being in one of the incarcerated groups. The second study examined neuropsychological differences between seven murderers; three who killed impulsively and four who premeditated a murder. There were no conclusive results from this study, which may be due to the small sample size. It is suggested that identifying pathways to violence can inform therapeutic interventions. The indication of executive dysfunction as a pathway to violence was used to develop an intervention specifically geared towards executive deficits in violent offenders. The third study, Study Three (which was not completed due to constraints imposed by the research setting beyond the control of the researcher) includes the design of a study to assess the outcome of an intervention for inmates with ED. The intervention itself is appended to this thesis.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/320</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Form-focused Instruction in L2 French</field><field name="creator">Erlam, Rosemary May</field><field name="description">While substantial evidence lends support to an explicit focus on form in language programme design, there is a need for systematic investigation of the relative effectiveness of subtypes of explicit L2 instruction (Norris &amp; Ortega, 2000). This study considers planned approaches to form-focused instruction, that is, focus-on-forms (Long, 1991). It contrasts grammar instruction that is deductive (i.e., involving rule presentation and metalinguistic information) with instruction that is inductive (i.e., instruction that focuses student attention on form but includes no rule presentation). Language instruction traditionally focuses on giving students opportunities to produce the particular language forms that have been the focus of instruction. Recent research claims that instruction that gives students the opportunity to process language input is more effective (e.g.,VanPatten, 1996, 2002a). This study compares the relative effectiveness of structured input and output-based instruction. Most research investigates the effectiveness of instruction in terms of overall group gains. A particular instructional method may not, however, benefit all learners uniformly. This study establishes whether there is any relationship between the effectiveness of the instructional methods investigated and learner aptitude. The study was conducted in a New Zealand high school and the structure targeted was direct object pronouns in L2 French. Students (N = 92) were assigned to four groups: (a) structured input instruction; (b) output-based/deductive instruction; (c) inductive instruction (input/output-based); (d) control. They were assessed on listening comprehension, reading comprehension, written production and oral production tasks. All but one of these language measures required a pressured response. Students were also assessed on measures of language aptitude: (a) language analytic ability, (b) phonemic coding ability and (c) working memory.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/321</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A new approach to estimate congestion impacts for highway evaluation: effects on fuel consumption and vehicle emissions</field><field name="creator">Greenwood, Ian Douglas</field><field name="description">The evaluation of highway projects where traffic congestion is a significant problem requires careful analysis to accurately identify the true costs, and therefore potential benefits, of operational changes. Models have previously been derived that employ either simplistic speed-flow approaches or highly detailed micro-simulation techniques. Another approach, and the goal for this research, is to develop a midrange modelling framework whereby the predictive capability could be enhanced in comparison to the simple speed-flow models but without the onerous data issues of micro-simulation, for use in highway evaluation projects. The approach adopted was based on modelling of acceleration noise defined as the standard deviation of the accelerations. During periods of high traffic congestion there is a greater variability in speed resulting in higher acceleration noise levels. Once the acceleration noise level is estimated, the impact on fuel consumption and vehicle emissions can then be determined. The framework consists of a series of discrete sub-models that firstly estimate the base (steady-speed) fuel consumption and then the acceleration noise level value. From these data, the additional fuel consumption from congestion is calculated and vehicle emissions are finally estimated. In this way, the model can be made more flexible for application to future research because it allows replacement of any portion of the model sub-routines without the need for a complete restructuring of the model framework. Data collection and analysis of the regimes for modelling were undertaken on highways in Auckland (New Zealand), Kuala Lumpur (Malaysia) and Bangkok (Thailand). The new modelling approach and the results of the work have been integrated into with the International Study of Highway Development and Management Tools (ISOHDM) in order to provide a model for inclusion into the Highway Development and Management Model version 4 (HDM-4). Fuel consumption predictions were tested both with and without the impact of a simulated acceleration noise level. For the latter of the two (i.e. a given drive cycle) the predictions were within 0.25 per cent. When including the impacts of a generated drive cycle from a known level of acceleration noise, the results show a consistent under-prediction of some 25 percent when compared with on-road test results. It is believed that this under-prediction is largely due to the assumption of the acceleration noise data conforming to a Normal Distribution. The research results of the new modelling approach for emissions have been tested against an existing data set of seven vehicles sourced from independent research on Auckland&#8217;s motorways. Vehicle emissions of carbon dioxide and hydrocarbons were under-predicted by some 50 per cent in relation to the average tested vehicle, but were still well within the range of the seven observed results. Carbon monoxide and oxides of nitrogen were grossly under-predicted and were below the minimum observed values. The new modelling approach, even with the above limitations, still has wide application in improving the prediction of vehicles operating on highways in congested conditions. The patterns of fuel consumption and emissions are showing the appropriate changes in relation to traffic congestion, and therefore further calibration is required. Furthermore, the model framework readily lends itself to enhancement via adoption of some new sub-models.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/323</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Basic word order in De Agricultura</field><field name="creator">Hanna, Kirsten M</field><field name="description">Latin word order has been the subject of scholarly debate for centuries, yet the question is far from resolved. In terms of the basic order of the clause's core constituents, some analysts argue that the basic order is SOV, while others argue for SVO. Some scholars argue that basic order is determined primarily by pragmatic principles, others hold the view that order is primarily syntactically determined, and others suggest that both syntactic and pragmatic principles are in operation. The purpose of this study is to contribute to the debate on basic order in Latin and its determinants. Specifically, I examine the order of subject, object and verb in De agricultura, an agricultural manual written in the 2nd century BC. The study shows that the orders SV and OV are so overwhelmingly predominant that we are justified in labelling them as basic; indeed they are so common that we could argue that the order of these elements is relatively fixed. Departures from the basic order fall into two categories: those instances where a subject or object comes later in the clause than usual (i.e. after the verb) and those instances where they appear earlier in the clause than usual (i.e. in a fronting construction). It will be shown that there is a constellation of factors which must be taken into account to explain the distribution and function of these deviations, including the information status of a fronted or postposed NP's referent, its pragmatic function in the clause, and the function of the clause in structuring the discourse. In summary, I argue that in De agricultura there is a syntactically determined basic order for subject, object and verb, and that departures from the basic order are motivated by pragmatic factors, viz either (a) the need to draw attention to an NP's referent(s) for a specific discourse-structuring reason or (b) the positioning of certain 'focally heavy' information after light verbs.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/322</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Kristeva&#8217;s Social Theory: A Lacanian Critique for Education</field><field name="creator">Holmes, Lucille Anne</field><field name="description">This research aims to provide a symptomatic reading of the work of Julia Kristeva. A symptomatic reading is one that constructs the problematic or the unsaid of the text. As a symptomatic reader, I attempt to occupy a position within a theoretical discourse that interrogates the texts by Kristeva and those that surround her work. In doing so, my aim is to make visible the suppressed and excluded discourses within Kristevan theory and which have enabled that theory to make sense in particular ways. The specific systems of meaning in Kristeva&#8217;s work that I will interrogate coalesce around her theory of the semiotic and the symbolic, which is presented as a revolutionary theory of subjectivity in relation to the social. Kristeva&#8217;s theory will be critically examined in terms of how it is formulated in relation to the theories of Althusser, Hegel and Lacan. Each chapter aims to displace an accepted or dominant interpretation by Kristeva and also by her readers. In reconstructing the problematic that is concealed in Kristeva&#8217;s work, I will explore how her theory maintains an Althusserian approach to social theory, and how this underlies her critique of Hegel and Lacan. In the final chapters on Lacan, my argument is that Kristeva&#8217;s critique of Lacanian psychoanalysis is inherently flawed and that this, therefore, leads her psychoanalytic work into ethically difficult areas. In the last chapter, on education and transference, I will show how certain educational applications of Kristevan psychoanalysis culminate in the very same ethical problems. These ethical difficulties, I will argue, are avoided by Lacanian psychoanalysis and, therefore, by its application to education.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/324</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The development and validation of a student evaluation instrument to identify highly accomplished mathematics teachers</field><field name="creator">Irving, Stephen Earl</field><field name="description">This study describes the attributes of a highly accomplished mathematics teacher as reported by the students in their class, and also determines whether high school students can differentiate between highly accomplished mathematics teachers and others. The 51-item instrument, Students Evaluating Accomplished Teaching &#8211; Mathematics, was developed to map the construct of highly accomplished teaching as articulated by the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards in their Adolescent and Young Adulthood Mathematics Standards. Two focus groups of New Zealand high school mathematics teachers reviewed these Standards, and found that there were more similarities than differences between the Standards and what they would expect of a highly accomplished teacher in New Zealand. Questionnaire items were drafted relating to each of 470 statements in the Standards. These items were trialled in New Zealand high schools, and analysed using factor analysis and item response theory, to select items that completely mapped the Standards. The questionnaire was then administered to 1611 students in the classes of thirty-two National Board Certified Teachers and twenty-six non-Board colleagues in 13 states of the USA. Multivariate analysis of variance and discriminant function analysis were used to establish that students can record and report the difference between NBCTs and their non-Board certified colleagues, and describe what students believe are the attributes of a good teacher. Highly accomplished teachers build a relationship between their students and the mathematics curriculum, as well as with the language and processes of mathematics, by engaging their minds with challenging material and rich tasks. These results provide further validation of the NBPTS certification process, and indicate that students provide dependable evaluations of their teachers. The student evaluation questionnaire could be used with confidence in both the USA and New Zealand to identify highly accomplished mathematics teachers.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/326</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Understanding customer value: an action research-based study of contemporary marketing practice</field><field name="creator">Little, Victoria Janine</field><field name="description">This thesis provides a rich and thick (Geertz, 1973) understanding of customer value, and the process of customer value creation and delivery. It achieves this through a three-stage multi-method action research based study including survey work, multiple cases, and a single site industrial SME case. The study is grounded in the resourcebased view (RBV) of the firm, providing a linkage between the strategic management and marketing disciplines. The purpose of this research is to support theory development in the area of customer value. A new definition of customer value was developed, recognising the complex, dynamic and multi-dimensional nature of the construct. The definition is supported by a series of empirically based conceptual frameworks, describing the customer value construct and the customer value development process of the firm. A number of perspectives on customer value-related marketing practice were found. Successive stages of the research identified six approaches to creating and delivering customer value: Traditional Transactional, Transitional or hybrid, Traditional Relational, Network, Systemic and Pluralistic. These approaches are not mutually exclusive. Rather, they characterise various approaches to customer value creation and delivery practiced in various contexts (e.g. for-profit and not-for-profit, consumer and industrial) and at various levels within firms (e.g. senior management, functional and front-line), strongly suggesting a contingency of practice. The customer value creation and delivery process was conceptualised as a triad, viewed through the lens of making, keeping, and enabling promises (Gronroos, 1996). A fourth dimension, realising promises, was added, encompassing the outputs of the process (i.e. financial and non-financial value for both customer and firm). Future research should be directed at testing and refining elements of the conceptual frameworks and value postures, offering significant benefits to practicing managers, to management education, and to theoretical understanding.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/327</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Employment system mental models in organisation building : founder&#8217;s mental models of employment in New Zealand biotechnology start-ups</field><field name="creator">Ho, Marcus</field><field name="description">The majority of biotechnology firms are founded by scientists and the organisations are characterized by high human capital density. The existing research has focused on these founders and their impact on the human and social capital within their firms (Powell, 1996; Murray, 2004). However, there are significant gaps in understanding the unique requirements and employment demands of biotechnology start-ups. While there have been several studies investigating the organisation and building of the employment system of entrepreneurial firms (e.g., Burton, 1995), our understanding of the role founders play in building of the employment system still remains limited particularly in the context of biotechnology. The focus of this study is how founders of biotechnology companies organise and build the employment system in their start-up ventures. Based on a study of three biotechnology firms and their founders, this thesis adopts an integrative cognitive methodology in studying the founder&#8217;s role in the employment system creation within their new ventures. This study builds on an in-depth multi-method case study approach in examining founders&#8217; mental models of the employment system and the organisations that they have built. The findings suggest that founders approach the human capital systems within their firm with a specific mental model of human capital organisation. These mental models of the employment system emphasise informal and formal managerial practices that are designed to achieve various aspects of the organisation&#8217;s culture and goals. The findings also suggest that founders&#8217; mental models of employment systems are influenced by a variety of determining factors that include strategic choice, environmental influences and individual backgrounds that shape the nature and content of the employment system they form.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/328</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Thalidomide Metabolism and Metabolites</field><field name="creator">Lu, Jun</field><field name="description">Thalidomide, renowned for causing birth defects in the late 1950s when used for the relief of morning sickness, has attracted new interest for the treatment of inflammatory conditions such as erythema nodosum leprosum and human malignancies such as multiple myeloma. Different species have different sensitivities to thalidomide that could be related to differences in its metabolism. In this study, methodologies using liquid chromatographymass spectrometry were developed to identify thalidomide metabolites formed in vivo and in vitro in liver microsomes from mice, rabbits and humans, firstly to seek explanations for inter-species differences in sensitivity, and secondly to determine whether thalidomide or its metabolite(s) is the active agent. Four hydrolysis products were detected in plasma and urine samples from multiple myeloma patients (MMPs) on thalidomide therapy, and mice and rabbits after oral administration of thalidomide. Six hydroxylated metabolites were detected in mice and rabbits, but not in plasma and urine from MMPs. In vitro studies confirmed that murine and rabbit liver microsomes catalysed the hydroxylation of thalidomide efficiently, but significant production of hydroxylation of thalidomide was not observed using human liver microsomes. The degree of hydroxylation both in vivo and in vitro was highest in mice and lowest in humans with rabbits in between. It is unlikely that hydroxylated metabolites are responsible for the effects of thalidomide in the treatment of multiple myeloma, since they were not present in quantifiable amounts in patients who were responding to the treatment. The three major hydrolysis products that were detected in patients were compared with thalidomide for their ability to inhibit tube formation in an in vitro angiogenesis assay, to inhibit TNF production induced with LPS in human peripheral blood leucocytes, and to modulate DMXAA-induced TNF production and antitumour activity in mice. One of the three, N-(o-carboxybenzoyl)glutamic acid imide (CG) was found to be as active as thalidomide in all the assays at concentrations (1-2 &#956;g/ml) that are achievable in MMPs. Since CG has been shown by other laboratories to be non-teratogenic, the studies in this thesis indicate that CG would be a more favourable, non-teratogenic approach to cancer therapy compared with thalidomide.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/329</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A methodology for the optimisation and synthesis of digital FPGA-based circuits</field><field name="creator">Maunder, Richard Bruce</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the development and analysis of a methodology for designing and optimising digital FPGA-based circuits. The focus is on assisting the designer at a very high level &#8211; as either a pre-processor or as a specific solution design that can be reapplied. The study includes an investigation of related research, methods, and techniques. Initially, a synthesiser is developed to produce hardware description language listings for stochastic neural networks. This highlights the advantages and disadvantages of special-purpose synthesis. In particular, the close hardware mapping of stochastic summation and sigmoidal activation functions is described. The second synthesiser is developed for general purpose synthesis. It is based on synchronous sub-circuit modules and supports hierarchical designs. The modules are described in static libraries or in extensions to the synthesiser core that create the modules during synthesis. The modules can be of various data types including parallel, serial, and stochastic representations. The synthesiser supports hardware resource-sharing to trade-off cell count and cycle count. It analyses the circuits in terms of their pipelined data flow and operating latency. A separate module scheduler and controller circuit is synthesised as part of the synthesiser's operation. A genetic algorithm is tailored to the problem of digital circuit optimisation through the development of specific structures and procedures. In particular, a concise encoding of the circuit is developed that the genetic algorithm can manipulate. Specific crossover and mutation mechanisms are also developed to complement the functionality of the synthesiser. The searches are effected by altering module data type, hardware resource sharing, and module implementation version. A fitness function is derived that makes use of a number of optimisation parameters to objectively evaluate each particular circuit. The features of each circuit are calculated and estimated during the analysis phase. This includes an estimate of cell-count for a particular target technology, for which the concept of a hardware compression factor is introduced. The developed software implementations are examined in terms of the software development process. Various engineering issues are discussed along with details of the development strategies employed. The synthesis software is designed for robustness, low development time, and low debugging time. The cost is a less-than-optimal operating speed of the synthesis and optimisation code. Two detailed case studies are examined to show the synthesis and optimisation performance. A formula is derived to calculate the quantitative extents of the design spaces being searched. The optimiser is shown to converge to 'fit' solutions-in terms of the desired constraints and the objective fitness function. Clustering of solution points in the design spaces is observed. These are generally narrow in terms of cycle count and considerable in terms of cell count. Trends are apparent across the design space showing that module data type and resource sharing are correlated to cell-count and cycle-count. Different circuit optimisations produce different correlations such that an overall generalisation was not appropriate.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/331</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A broad application optimisation-based rostering model</field><field name="creator">Nielsen, David</field><field name="description">This work considers the automated generation of high quality rosters for the general rostering situation.

This interest in the socially and culturally constructed aspects of human functioning rests upon a Vygotskian perspective, which I review along with various appropriations of this theory and other viewpoints in the literature review. Based upon this analysis, I then present a model for Collective Mediation, which views the computer as a mediational tool encompassed within the collaborative activity of the groups involved in this study. At this point I also suggest a protocol, or framework, for understanding this joint activity, which then guides the research methodology. The primary source of data in the study consists of transcriptions of focus group meetings with the participants over a four month period of time, a method that is justified by the requirements of the research to understand the multitude of relationships among the group members and with computer technology. To support triangulation, a questionnaire, log sheets, and member checks were also employed. The results reveal not only a rich fabric of activities and meanings, but a complex social dynamic guiding the events leading up to the construction of a joint project: one that was constrained, as well as supported, by the use of computers. In key areas, the pedagogy studied was shown to lack support. This thesis adds material to the debate concerning the interface between the computer, as an increasingly complex medium for educational activities, and the social fabric created within an authentic group project at tertiary level. There are clear practical implications. On a theoretical level, the study adds to an understanding of how neo-Vygotskian theory can, or cannot, be interpreted to understand such settings and, in terms of methodology, the study introduces a new protocol for analysing the rich data set that is needed to capture the dynamics involved.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/333</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Going far?: John O&#8217;Shea&#8217;s Runaway in the context of his attempt to establish a feature film industry in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Reynolds, John Stuart</field><field name="description">Over the past two decades, the amount of media attention and scholarly research focused on New Zealand feature-films has greatly increased. However, because this work has emphasised directors and films from 1977 onwards, John O&#8217;Shea (1920- 2001) has not received the detailed treatment called for in terms of the crucial role he played in sustaining and building film production in New Zealand through his company Pacific Films. This thesis seeks to make a comprehensive study of one of O&#8217;Shea&#8217;s most important feature films, Runaway (1964). The film provides a classic example of the importance of contexts in film study, and this thesis seeks to explore a variety of relevant contexts &#8211; the previous history of film production in New Zealand; the development of a general &#8216;film culture&#8217;; O&#8217;Shea&#8217;s personal background; the events leading up to the Runaway&#8217;s production; the social, cultural, technical and financial challenges O&#8217;Shea faced in completing the film; and its reception and subsequent influence. His earlier and later feature films are also discussed in some detail. The limited amount of previous scholarship on this topic necessitated primary research of various kinds, beginning with a study of the extensive records of Pacific Films &#8211; scripts, correspondence, music scores, flyers, press clippings, etc. Interviews were conducted with O&#8217;Shea over a six-year period. In addition, interviews were held with various people involved in the production of Runaway, as well as a number of writers. These included Colin Broadley, Betty Curnow, John Graham, Kevin Ireland, William Johnstone and Ian Mune. Runaway makes an interesting case study for many reasons &#8211; its novelty as the first 35mm feature made in New Zealand for 12 years; O&#8217;Shea&#8217;s struggle to create the necessary creative and technical infrastructure; the influence of contemporary European cinema; the film&#8217;s portrayal of an &#8216;Angry Young Man&#8217; combined with the New Zealand &#8216;Man Alone&#8217; tradition; and its creative achievement in a situation when there were so few precedents or possible ways of funding film-making. This thesis seeks to expand the record of an under-researched period of our film history, to provide insights into the dynamics of New Zealand culture at the time, and to analyse O&#8217;Shea&#8217;s remarkable contribution to the development of a local film industry.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/334</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Antimicrobial Factor From Grapes</field><field name="creator">Rhodes, Phillippa Louise</field><field name="description">Food-borne pathogens and in particular the emergence of new food-borne bacterial pathogens, which includes Listeria monocytogenes, are a significant threat to public health. This thesis investigated a commercial red grape juice, derived from Vitis vinifera variety Ribier grapes, with a strong inhibitory action against Listeria monocytogenes. The commercial grape juice caused a 6- log reduction in Listeria monocytogenes numbers within 10 minutes exposure to the grape juice. The inhibitory effect was specific to all Listeria species. The grape juice was bactericidal and inhibitory at pH &#8804; 5.0. The addition of protein (BSA), PVPP, and metal ions (Fe3+ and Mg2+) suppressed the antilisterial activity of the grape juice. The antilisterial factor in the commercial grape juice was identified as pigmented condensed tannin (proanthocyanidin oligomers). The antilisterial pigmented condensed tannin in the commercial grape juice was likely derived from the skin of Ribier grapes. Fractionation of the commercial grape juice pigmented condensed tannin by molecular weight revealed that the antilisterial activity was distributed over a range (mean degree of polymerisation 2.8 through 8.5) of tannin fractions. Condensed tannin fraction (G) had a mean degree of polymerisation of 5.9 and was found to have the strongest antilisterial activity. The molecular weight of oligomers identified in fraction G ranged from MW 867 to MW 2905. Fraction G contained the highest percentage of polymeric colour with 90% the pigmented moieties (anthocyanins) in the fraction incorporated into the polymer structure. Fraction G was comprised of the flavonoid subunits catechin, epicatechin, epigallocatechin, and epicatechin-3-O-gallate. Ribier grape seed condensed tannin had strong antilisterial activity. The antilisterial condensed tannin derived from Ribier grape seed was comprised of the flavonoid subunits catechin, epicatechin, and epicatechin-3-O-gallate and increasing antilisterial activity was associated with increasing mean degree of polymerisation of the tannin polymers. The efficacy of the pigmented condensed fraction of the commercial grape juice and Ribier grape seed condensed tannin as natural food preservatives were assessed. In the presence of Listeria monocytogenes contaminated cabbage the inhibitory activity of the pigmented condensed tannin from commercial grape juice was suppressed. The antilisterial activity of the Ribier grape seed condensed tannin was reduced but not eliminated when Listeria monocytogenes was associated with cabbage. The grape seed tannin may be effective at eliminating Listeria monocytogenes from food.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/335</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Connecting selves: relationship, identity and reflexivity on the 'frontline' in a New Zealand call centre</field><field name="creator">Copas, Susan</field><field name="description">This dissertation centres on process and connection. Beyond the popular concept of &#8216;worklife balance&#8217; it presents an integral and holistic view of how work (including the &#8216;work&#8217; of research), and life are inextricably connected. Eschewing the more conventional model of the PhD; it does not develop a question (or set of questions) about this area of interest, and then proffer answers. Rather, it works with/in an ever emerging flow of living relationships and experiences, to offer inclusive, constantly shifting understandings of the embodied dialogical processes that relationally construct and connect people, our &#8216;selves,&#8217; in the everyday flow of life, work and research centred around a particular organisational setting: a large public sector call centre. The study rests on the assumption that rich multiply inflected emergent processes and relationships &#8216;make&#8217; people and their worlds, including the world of research. Hence the dissertation is presented as an on-going construction, in which individuals and organisations are not autonomous entities, but are in-effect, always becoming. The organisation, its frontline staff, managers, and I (the &#8216;researcher&#8217;) emerge moment-bymoment, relationally made and remade, within the communicative realm of embodied language, in many different social, local, and historically inflected ways. In the field, this everyday becoming is explored using a hybrid form of organisational ethnography and collaborative action research. On the page, academic prose, stories and narrative poems combine and interweave to (re)construct and deconstruct the situated dialogues and relationships. Narrated in two parts, the first section - &#8220;Telling Stories&#8221; - works with contexts, scene setting and character development. Its layered and iterative unfolding begins with a day-in-the-life story of work, life and research at the call centre. The section then outlines the attitudes and assumptions that guide relational-responsive becoming, before detailing the political economic, organisational and personal backgrounds and values influencing this study. With/in the conversations and complications of collaborative practice I &#8216;show and tell&#8217; how &#8216;coming to know what is known&#8217; is a rich relational emergent process that reworks research away from the more traditional notion of it as data gathering and retrospective analysis. Part two - &#8220;Stories Told&#8221; - is the heart of this study. It brings a sense of emergence to life by focusing the kaleidoscopic lenses of relationship, identity and reflexivity on people-in-process within the dynamic interplay of call centre technologies, organisational systems and human interaction; both at work and outside of the workplace. The stories interweave the rich multidimensionality of emergent lives, as they explore the camaraderie and subversion of working in a tightly monitored and time pressured environment, amidst changing conceptions of what constitutes public service in New Zealand. Radically reflexive, they unsettle the often taken-for-granted assumptions, feelings, actions and words that make selves in life, work and research. In doing so, the stories raise expansive and inclusive possibilities for new ways of understanding each other, our knowledges, practices and experiences. They also remind us of the everyday, every moment possibilities for developing more mindful and holistic understandings of the relational processes and the communicative practices, within which we make our selves, our organisations, and our worlds.

It focuses on examining how Christian missionaries and Chinese reformers, in the process of advancing their goals, made use of aspects of Western musical culture and how their actions helped facilitate the introduction of Western music to a wider Chinese audience in the late Qing. The purpose of this study is to show that the introduction of Western music in China was essentially a by-product of Christian evangelism and Chinese reformism. The central contention of the thesis is that Western music was introduced to the Chinese not for its aesthetic appeal or artistic superiority but for its utility in China&#8217;s conversion to God and in its struggle for modernity. This study is constructed upon empirical evidence chiefly from primary sources and from citations in Chinese and Western scholarship. It makes use of written accounts such as diaries, letters, memoirs, newspaper and magazine materials, religious tracts, sermons, and visual representations of musical activity in contemporaneous paintings, photos, drawings and prints. The thesis is divided into two main parts. The first part, comprising Chapters 1 to 4, investigates the uses of music in Christian missions in China and the role of missionaries in the introduction and gradual spread of Western music in China. The second part, consisting of Chapters 5 to 9, deals with the role of Chinese reformers and that of Japan in the wide dissemination of Western music at the turn of the twentieth century. The Conclusion recapitulates some of the findings from the nine chapters and restates the general argument of this thesis. It also offers some reflections on the broad significance of the role of the missionaries and Chinese reformers in the forming of a new musical tradition in China.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/337</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Recognising women&#8217;s responses to heart disease symptoms: different groups respond in different ways</field><field name="creator">Campbell, Cheryl Anne</field><field name="description">This study explored the recognition and understanding of angina or heart attack symptoms and the reasons for delay in seeking appropriate care with particular reference to women and Maori. The study population consisted of European and Maori people aged between 45 and 85 years either diagnosed as being at high risk of having a heart attack, experiencing angina, or requiring admission to hospital with their first heart attack. The study methodology is a qualitative analysis of 30 individual interviews (nine European women, nine European men, five Maori women and seven Maori men) conducted using grounded theory. A semi-structured interview schedule followed the sequence of events that led to seeking medical care. Interviews were audio taped, transcribed and coded using a computer software programme. The data analysis included collaboration with Maori. Delay times from symptom onset to hospital admission were: five participants delayed less than two hours (range 1 hour to 1 hour 30 minutes), and six participants delayed more than 2 hours (range 2 hours 30 minutes to 10 hours). Delay times from symptom onset until attending a medical clinic were: four participants delayed less than 2 hours (range 1-2 hours) and fourteen participants delayed more than 2 hours (range 4-24 hours). Reasons for delay, common to both European and Maori were: difficulties recognising their symptoms, self treatment, obtaining reassurance, differences in symptom descriptions between the participants and doctors, and several participants&#8217; symptoms were initially misdiagnosed. In the European group specific reasons related to delay were: a lack of knowledge, and consultations with general practitioners. European women reported that uncommon symptoms were disregarded in the pre-diagnosis period. For Maori, specific reasons for delay were: a greater emphasis on consulting family and minimising the symptoms. Participants had a codified set of rules within the self regulatory model that determined their actions that became the emergent theme in the overarching category &#8211; &#8216;Recognising Women&#8217;s Responses to Heart Disease Symptoms: Different groups respond in different ways&#8217;. The fact that people have different perceptions about symptoms, endure symptoms in different ways, obtain reassurance in different ways, and take action in different ways formed the categories that made up the theoretical concept. The rules differed according to gender and culture. The study findings will contribute to the understanding of gender and cultural differences in care seeking for heart disease symptoms.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/338</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mechanisms of compensation in agenesis of the corpus callosum</field><field name="creator">Barr, Melodie</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the compensatory mechanisms that allow information to be available to both cerebral hemispheres in individuals with agenesis of the corpus callosum. The first set of experiments, detailed in Chapter Three, were designed to determine what types of visual information can be integrated interhemispherically in these subjects. Two acallosals, J.P. and M.M., and ten control subjects were tested. Results showed that M.M., whose anterior commissure was within normal limits, was much worse at matching colours and letters between visual fields than within visual fields, while J.P., whose anterior commissure was greatly enlarged, showed no evidence of interhemispheric disconnection on these tasks. This suggests that in some cases of callosal agenesis an enlarged anterior commissure may compensate for the lack of a corpus callosum. Neither acallosal subject showed disconnection on tasks requiring integration of location and orientation, however, suggesting that the anterior commissure plays no role in such tasks, although both subjects performed poorly relative to controls. These tasks may depend on subcortical commissures, such as the intertectal commissure. The two experiments in Chapter Four tested J.P. and M.M. tested on a simple reaction-time (RT) task, with visual stimuli presented either singly to one or the other visual field or in bilaterally presented pairs. Stimuli were either white against a black background, or grey against an equiluminant yellow background. RTs to bilateral pairs were decreased beyond predictions based on a simple race between independent unilateral processes, implying interhemispheric neural summation. This effect was enhanced under equiluminance in M.M., but not J.P., suggesting that the anterior commissure may act, relative to its size, to affect cortical activation to bilateral pairs, which then acts to decrease subcortical neural summation. In Chapter Five, J.P., M.M. and A.L.M. (the daughter of M.M.), and twelve control subjects were tested on a simple RT task, with visual evoked potentials collected using a high-density 128-channel system. Independent-components analyses were performed to isolate the visual components of interest. Contrary to previous research with acallosals, evidence of ipsilateral activation was present in all three acallosal subjects. While ipsilateral visual components were present in all four unilateral conditions in M.M. and A.L.M., in J.P. these were present only in the crossed visual field/hand conditions and not in the uncrossed conditions. It is suggested that individual differences and methodological limitations in the previous studies due to the small number of electrodes used are the most likely explanation for the difference in findings. Finally, due to the clear individual differences in aetiology, neurophysiology and compensatory mechanisms utilized by the three acallosal subjects tested here, a case study approach was taken with each subject discussed separately.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/339</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fiction and the emotions.</field><field name="creator">Travinor, Grant</field><field name="description">Our participation with works of fiction involves the emotions. Just what this involvement amounts to is a question of great interest. I argue that the literature on the involvement of the emotions in fictive practice has usually made several mistakes. Firstly it has assumed that the emotions are better understood than they actually are. I argue that the theory of emotions common to most of the theories of fiction and the emotion is far from controversial. Revising our conception on what emotions are may allow us to revise our conception of the nature of our emotional involvement in fiction. Second, I argue that two forms of problem are often conflated when philosophers discuss fictional and the emotions. There are semantic and ontological problems, and substantive psychological problems. Often these problems are confused for each other. Distinguishing between the two forms of problem will help to clear up the significant disagreements that exist in the literature. My thesis is broadly naturalised in intent, in the hope that this focus will be productive in explaining the role of the emotions in fictive practice.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/340</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Deformation characteristics of knitted fabric composites</field><field name="creator">Duhovic, Miro</field><field name="description">A relatively recent innovation in the field of thermoplastic composites is the reinforcement with knitted structure that offers a number of potential advantages over the more conventional straight-fibre reinforcements. They can be stretched in both directions during forming, increasing the potential for forming complex and deeplycurved components and have excellent impact, fracture toughness and energy absorption properties. An understanding of some of the unique behaviour of these sheet materials during forming and the practical viability of various forming processes are crucial in assessing their applicability to given products and uses. The first part of this study concentrates on identifying the types of micro-level mechanisms that occur during the forming process of knitted fabric thermoplastic composite sheets. It has been proposed that knitted fabrics and textile composite materials, in general, follow a three-level hierarchy of deformation modes. The most important of these levels are the micro-level fabric deformation modes, which have been identified and specifically developed for study in this thesis. In order to study these modes, the material has been subjected to a series of simple inplane, single and double curvature forming experiments. The main purpose of the inplane forming experiments was to record tensile data that would later be used to establish the warp and weft direction modulus curves, important inputs for the numerical simulations. Grid strain analysis (GSA) was also performed to investigate the strains that occur during the forming of more complex shaped components and to verify the numerical simulation results. The experiments highlighted that the behaviour of the molten composite was very similar to that of the dry fabric at forming rates below 100mm/min and that the lubricating effects of chemical sizing on fibres in both the composite and the fabric were present. It was also found that a more even surface strain and thickness distribution could be attained using flexible tooling and higher forming temperatures. iii High fibre volume fraction knitted fabric composites were produced from 1x1 rib fabric made from commingled yarn at different pressures and temperatures. The material was able to match the stiffness and strength of a commercially available woven fabric product, Twintex&#174;, for strains of up to 8%. An optimum forming pressure of 400kPa was found to give the best consolidation without causing fibre damage due to excessive compression. During the forming experiments the importance of the reinforcing structure was realised and provided the impetus for a detailed micro-level numerical investigation. The simulation involved the production of a narrow strip of 1x1 rib fabric and subsequent tensile testing. The model was verified in two ways: i) by comparing the physical and numerical specimens geometrically and ii) by using force displacement curves generated from the tensile tests on real specimens manufactured using the same knitting machine parameters. A correlation factor was defined to allow the comparison of numerical and physical specimens containing different numbers of fibres. Comprehensive analysis of the model revealed bending as the most dominant microlevel mechanism, followed by torsion, uniaxial tension and contact energy at low strain levels and bending followed by uniaxial tension, contact energy and torsion at high strain levels. In addition, macro-level numerical modelling was performed using the data gathered from molten tensile tests. A PAMFORM&#8482; material model originally designed to model the sheet behaviour of unidirectional and woven composites was used. Minimum thickness strains showed close agreement. However, further development of the model is required to allow more accurate predictions of the surface strains and stability at very high strain values.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/341</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The particle ai in New Zealand Ma&#772;ori</field><field name="creator">Hunter, Ian Murray</field><field name="description">This study looked at the functions and uses of the problematic particle ai in New Zealand M&#257;ori. Ai is described primarily as a verbal particle. It appears in a number of seemingly disparate constructions, has no parallel in English, and there has never been a satisfactory explanation of all its uses. The data consists of a large corpus of sentences containing ai that were extracted from selected texts written by native speakers from as early as the 19th Century up until 2005. Sentences were also solicited from fluent speakers. Analysis of the data and discussions with native speakers led to the conclusion that ai exists as two distinct particles, which were labelled habitual ai, and anaphoric ai. Habitual ai is a verbal marker that confers habitual aspect on its verb. It was found that it is mainly used by speakers from the Eastern regions of the North Island. Anaphoric ai refers back to some element earlier in the discourse. It has two forms, labelled resumptive ai and resultative ai. Resumptive ai is an anaphoric pro-form that resumes a specific noun phrase in its clause. It was found to have a grammatical function. When resumptive ai was deleted from its clause consultants judged the results ill-formed. An example of a construction with resumptive ai is a sentence with an adverbial of reason located before the verb. Resultative ai locates its clause in prior discourse, making a causal link between its clause and the prior element. It was found to have a mainly lexical function. When resultative ai was deleted from its clause consultants judged that the meaning had altered and that the causal link was weakened or lost. An example of a construction with resultative ai is a purpose clause which follows an action that has been carried out for that specific purpose. This thesis provides a unified explanation for all uses of ai. It also accounts for previously unexplained appearances, by showing that one form of ai may occur in environments restricted to another. Its appearance in non-verbal phrases are accounted for, and observations have been made about changes in its use over time.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420300 Cultural Studies::420306 Maori cultural studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/343</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Organics in atmospheric particulates</field><field name="creator">Khanal, Obi</field><field name="description">The use of headspace solid phase microextraction (HS-SPME) as a sample concentration and preparation technique for the analysis of organics in air particulates has been developed and optimised. Organic compounds in atmospheric particulate matter (PM) collected on quartz filters were found to yield a maximum gas chromatographic response (peak area) on heating at 100oC for 30 minutes. The most effective sample cooling time prior to sample concentration was found to be 7 minutes and the best exposure equilibrium time was 10 minutes. The optimum GC/MS desorption time determined was 5 minutes. The precision and reproducibility of this HS-SPME method was found to be very good. Atmospheric particulate (PM10) from Auckland, Hamilton and Christchurch, New Zealand, were collected on a daily basis through a series of seasonal campaign in 1999 to 2001. Organic compounds from the particulate samples were extracted and concentrated by HS-SPME and analysed by GC/MS. The technique of SPME headspace followed by GC/MS analysis has been used for the first time to analyse atmospheric particulates. Two years of samples from spring 1999 were collected and analysed qualitatively. A large number of volatile and semi-volatile organic compounds from air particulates were identified and found to differ from site to site. The compounds found on the PM10 samples were classified into four different classes as most common, common, less common, and rare. The compounds which ranged from highly volatile (methylene chloride and benzene, toluene, ethyl benzene and xylene (BTEX) to less volatile (heptadecane and 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylphenol)were identified and a variation between seasons observed. The organics identified in the particulate matter are known to be associated with both natural and anthropogenic sources. The boiling points of the detected organics ranged from 40oC to 391oC and were found to be normally distributed. However, most of the organics (66%) were found to have their boiling point range between 140 and 240oC. Vapour pressure of organics ranged from 0.0002 to 10.13 kPa, but 82% were found to be within the range of 0.05 to 1.0 kPa. Similarly the carbon number varied from C2&#8722;C24, with 68% of the total organics being C8&#8722;C13. The carbon number distribution was different between aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons. The concentrations of sixteen PAHs species in PM10 extracts were measured using GC/MS. Significant site and seasonal differences were observed and Hamilton recorded the lowest levels of all PAHs over all seasons. The highest seasonal variation was observed in Christchurch, where the total PAH concentrations in winter was 14 times higher than in autumn and unbelievably, 43 times higher than in summer, which was mostly contributed by benzo(k)fluoranthene and indino(1,2,3-cd)pyrene. All sites experienced peaks in their PAH concentrations in winter and lows in summer. Concentration ratios of the PAHs suggest that the main source of PAHs in New Zealand cities is from the combustion of fossil fuels. Overall this source contributed 71% to the total PAHs in Auckland, 72% in Christchurch, and 67% in Hamilton.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/344</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Alzheimer&#8217;s disease and the utilisation of procedural learning</field><field name="creator">Russell, Kathryn A.</field><field name="description">This thesis investigated the utilisation of procedural learning to improve self-care tasks and activities of daily living (ADLs) in mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD). Procedural learning is relatively preserved in AD, presumably due to relatively little degeneration of critical neural circuits. Current interventions for AD (medical and nonmedical) have limited effects on these skills, and attempts to enhance memory with explicit learning methods have been largely ineffective. Two studies assessed the effectiveness of procedural training for ADLs in AD. Study one involved both a group and single subject design (multiple baseline across tasks) with 12 pre-selected tasks. Eight AD participants were trained on six tasks (counterbalanced across subjects) for 10 days, six tasks remained untrained. The group showed significant improvement at post-test in performance time and number of errors for trained tasks, whereas untrained tasks showed no significant change. At post-test no significant difference was found between the AD and control groups on trained tasks. Seven of the 8 participants showed a significant decrease in overall performance time (binomial analyses) and errors (visual analyses) for trained tasks. Significant training effects were maintained at 12-week follow-up. There was variability in training effectiveness between individuals and tasks. Study two assessed the effectiveness of individually-tailored training programmes, in which tasks were selected for each individual according to task impairment and relevance. A single subject design, multiple baseline across tasks, was repeated across 6 participants. Change in task performance (time or errors) coincided with the onset of training. At post-test all participants showed some training benefits in either performance time or number of errors: 4 showed training effects on 77 to 100% of their tasks and 1 participant showed training effects in 60% of tasks. The final participant showed training effects in 75% of tasks, although a truncated follow-up period limited analyses. Training benefits endured throughout follow-up for 3 participants (2 to 4 months), and for at least 5 months for the 2 participants who had longer follow-up periods (some tasks endured up to 10 (KW) and 13 months (PB)). Procedural learning methods can assist individuals with mild-to-moderate AD maintain self-care skills and ADLs. Additionally, this method could be adapted to provide a model of effective communication for caregivers, for example, breaking tasks into components and presenting requests one at a time.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/345</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Making the instructional curriculum : case studies of seven teachers of adult ESOL</field><field name="creator">Wette, Rosemary</field><field name="description">Joseph Schwab claimed that only teachers are capable of translating scholarly theory into curriculum, as only they have knowledge of and are able to co-ordinate its four cornerstones of subject matter, learners, context and the teacher. Organised around Schwab&#8217;s heuristic, this thesis explores from an ecological perspective the curriculum making practices of seven experienced, effective teachers of adult ESOL over the trajectory of a course that each one taught. While normative advice in second language teacher education texts encourages a more systems-based approach to curriculum development, there is increasing awareness in research-based literature that the instructional curriculum is in fact an interactive construction played out in a dynamic, non-linear process and particularised to a certain context and group of learners. This evidencebased study aims to illustrate how teachers engage with written curriculum sources, classroom and cultural contexts, their own theories of practice and the developing understandings and wishes of learners as they make the instructional curriculum. Data were collected from guided pre-course and post-course interviews with teachers as well as persistent, debriefing-type interviews throughout the courses, supported by course documentation and teaching materials. Themes emerging from the data and from relevant literature were coded and analysed qualitatively. Findings of this study illuminate significant aspects of teachers&#8217; curriculum making practices, including the weaving of conceptual content onto the timeframe of the courses, teachers&#8217; efforts to achieve coherence, balance and variety in the instructional curriculum, and the importance of time and process. They emphasise the central role of the teacher as synthesiser of a variety of considerations, and provide evidence of the rich and complex understandings of teachers&#8217; professional knowledge in action. They also show the fundamental importance of good cognitive and affective rapport between teacher and learners, and the need for teachers to constantly monitor and adjust the instructional curriculum according to learners&#8217; developmental needs, while at the same time taking into account a unique constellation of influences from its micro- and macro- context. Implications for ESOL teachers and teacher educators of this more detailed understanding of the instructional curriculum and of teachers&#8217; professional knowledge bases are also explored.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education::330100 Education Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/348</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The professional socialisation of medical students through the preclinical to clinical transition</field><field name="creator">Lamdin, Rain Janet</field><field name="description">This thesis explores the professional socialisation of medical students through the preclinical to clinical transition of medical education. The research is based in a traditionally structured medical programme. Early clinical experiences are provided for students during their early years of teaching. Twenty-one students were interviewed in their third year and fourth year, before and after their shift into the clinical environment, and participant observation was also undertaken. The findings of this study are that in medical students&#8217; preclinical years human dissection teaches students to manage their emotions, and that students are separating from the lay world. Early clinical experiences in the preclinical years appear fragmented compared to the medical practice of doctors but, introduce students to aspects of medical work, patients and the patient case history. As students shift into their first full-time clinical year, they shape earlier knowledge to make it meaningful to its new context. Medical students &#8216;medicalise&#8217; patients through the patient case history, but they also &#8216;personalise&#8217; diseases as they associate patients with diseases. By learning in the clinical environment and being associated with medical teams, students observe and undertake parts of medical work, in an apprentice-style way. Finally, while students learn medical language and the patient case history, their experiences with patients requires them to be with patients in a way that is beyond the disease-based approach of medicine. This thesis concludes that while the biomedical science shapes students&#8217; early medical education, it is in the clinical environment that students learn to be doctors. This includes the biomedical-based practice of the patient case history, and physical examination, as well as how to be with patients when what is required from the student is not to &#8216;do&#8217; but to &#8216;be with&#8217; the patient.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/349</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Efficient and "fair" pricing under New Zealand&#8217;s power distribution sector reforms : a model of intertemporal cross subsidies and economic depreciation</field><field name="creator">Gunn, Calum Ian Maxwell</field><field name="description">The New Zealand Government&#8217;s objective in reforming the electricity supply industry has been economic efficiency. Policy actions specific to the power distribution sector have been based on the premise that electricity distribution is a natural monopoly, and a key desired outcome has been efficient and &#8220;fair&#8221; prices&#8212; those which allow electricity distributors to make a &#8220;fair return&#8221; on their network investments, while ensuring that consumers face prices which are &#8220;subsidy-free&#8221;. This thesis poses the question: what are the characteristics of efficient and &#8220;fair&#8221; prices for power distribution network services? Of crucial significance to this question is the time dimension, since debates over pricing principles posit: static versus dynamic efficiency; short run versus long run marginal cost; backward-looking versus forward-looking costs; historic cost versus replacement cost valuation; and back-loaded versus front-loaded depreciation. To address this question, a deterministic two-good/two-period model of intertemporal subsidy-free prices and economic depreciation is presented, by extending the model of intertemporal unsustainability developed by the contestability theorists, William Baumol, John Panzar and Robert Willig. This new model indicates that intertemporally subsidy-free prices are forward-looking, indexed to the hypothetical amortised opportunity costs incurred by a coalition of current and future consumers optimally constructing a greenfields network to meet their own demand. Depending on the similarities between this notional asset configuration and the incumbent distributor&#8217;s actual network, such prices may or may not reflect the distributor&#8217;s historic or replacement costs. Where spare capacity is optimally built today, in anticipation of future demand, prices should cover the opportunity cost of the total capacity required to meet current and future demand. Where capacity does not require expansion or replacement until some later date, prices should initially cover the opportunity cost of the capacity required to meet current demand alone, then rise to the cost of total capacity at such time as it would become optimal for consumers to construct greenfields capacity sufficient to meet both current and anticipated demand. These results reaffirm Marcel Boiteux&#8217;s position that spare capacity has its own income, as well as Ralph Turvey&#8217;s view that the expectation of lower costs in future raises today&#8217;s prices, providing&#8212;in some cases&#8212;justification for accelerated depreciation. However, under New Zealand&#8217;s light-handed regulatory regime, electricity distributor prices and associated depreciation schedules do not appear to have exhibited these characteristics.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/351</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ua malie toa ua malie tau = student with silver tongues whip the tail: enhanced teaching and learning of reading comprehension in Samoan bilingual classes</field><field name="creator">Amituanai-Toloa, Meaola</field><field name="description">The achievement of Samoan students in English reading comprehension has been identified as a major challenge for the education in New Zealand. This study examined the effectiveness of reading comprehension instruction in the context of six Samoan bilingual classrooms in two schools in South Auckland. The quasi-experimental intervention involved two phases over three years. One was the development of an inter-school standardised process of administering and scoring assessments to identify student weaknesses and strengths. The other involved 10 professional development sessions over the year built around the profiles of teaching and learning collected in the first year. Systematic observations of teacher instruction were carried out in both phases. In addition to the English reading comprehension measures, there were specially designed assessments of students&#8217; oral language and reading comprehension in Samoan. These assessements enabled relationships to be examined between students&#8217; Samoan oral language and reading comprehension and their English achievement. In addition, teachers were interviewed about their ideas of reading comprehension from a cultural perspective. Three approaches were used to judge the effectiveness of teaching. These showed that teaching became more effective generally when examined for students in a longitudinal cohort, but also for new cohorts in Year 1 and Year 2. In addition, the results showed that students in the bilingual classrooms had initially lower levels in reading comprehension in English but made more rapid gains with the intervention and reached comparable levels earlier. These gains are linked to specific changes in the teachers&#8217; instruction. Analyses showed that the focus of instruction, for example, instruction which increased general awareness was prominent in raising reading comprehension levels. Three teachers who attended professional development consistently showed more gains at the end of the study than the other three teachers who inconsistently attended. However, despite the gains achievement of bilingual students were still below national norms. At a general level, no relationships were found between Samoan oral language and reading comprehension and English reading comprehension but the presence of relationships between Samoan reading comprehension and English reading comprehension and between Samoan reading comprehension and English reading comprehension vocabulary at year 6 suggests a transitional effect particularly at the level of word knowledge. This effect might explain the lagging behind of achievement in English from year 4 and year 5 and a catching up at year 6. Teachers&#8217; placing more emphasis on vocabulary instruction evidenced in the observations suggests that this is an urgent need. While there was great variability in reading comprehension instruction, teacher ideas also add to the complexity given teachers&#8217; understanding of what comprehension is from the Samoan concepts of &#8216;iloa&#8217; (know) and &#8216;malamalama&#8217; (understand). Teachers differed in their understanding of these two terms. These findings suggest that low achievement in English reading comprehension can be changed, but there is more research that needs to be done to expand our knowledge of how Pasifika students in schools comprehend English texts but specifically how they should be taught.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/352</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Stochastic Geometry, Data Structures and Applications of Ancestral Selection Graphs</field><field name="creator">Cloete, Nicoleen</field><field name="description">The genealogy of a random sample of a population of organisms can be represented as a rooted binary tree. Population dynamics determine a distribution over sample genealogies. For large populations of constant size and in the absence of selection effects, the coalescent process of Kingman determines a suitable distribution. Neuhauser and Krone gave a stochastic model generalising the Kingman coalescent in a natural way to include the effects of selection.  The model of Neuhauser and Krone determines a distribution over a class of graphs of randomly variable vertex number, known as ancestral selection graphs. Because vertices have associated scalar ages, realisations of the ancestral selection graph process have randomly variable dimensions.  A Markov chain Monte Carlo method is used to simulate the posterior distribution for population parameters of interest. The state of the Markov chain Monte Carlo is a random graph, with random dimension and equilibrium distribution equal to the posterior distribution.

Over the last decade there has been considerable growth in the commercial dolphin-based tourism industry. This growth exposes coastal populations to boats and swimmers. New Zealand has allowed commercial operations offering swimming with wild dolphins since 1989. Little is known about the effects of boats and swimmers on dolphin behaviour. The present study examines a population of bottlenose dolphins that utilise the Bay of Islands as part of their range along the northeastern coast of New Zealand, and their behavioural response to commercial swim-with-dolphin operations. Data were collected from an independent research boat and the commercial dolphinwatching boats from December 1996 to February 2000. Photo-identification showed a closed population of 446 (95% C.I. 418-487) dolphins, with an 81% resight rate of the 378 catalogued individuals. Group size ranged from 2 &#8211; 50 dolphins, with 80% of groups (n = 160) containing 2 - 20 dolphins. The number of groups with calves present increased from 32% (n = 17) in 1997, to 63% (n = 47) in 1999. This could be explained by the increased number of neonates born; from four in 1997, to nine in 1999. Photo-identification in areas outside the Bay of Islands showed that individuals ranged minimum distances of 82 km north, and 388 km south of the Bay of Islands. All photographs taken outside the Bay of Islands were matched to known animals, suggesting that the majority of the northeastern coastal population is seen in the Bay. With the next nearest population of bottlenose dolphins approximately 1,000 km south, these dolphins probably form an isolated population ranging along the east coast of the northeastern North Island. Habitat use by the dolphins was examined using Geographic Positioning System (GPS) points simultaneously linked to behavioural states. In total, 31 groups were followed, and 847 GPS points were recorded. Position of initial encounter was recorded for 138 groups of dolphins. There was a significant correlation between water depth and sea-surface temperature, with dolphins found in deeper waters in summer when water temperature was highest, and in shallow waters in winter when the water temperature was lowest. Only one behavioural state, slow travel, was significantly different by season. Although all behaviours were observed in all zones, dolphins had preferential habitat use throughout the four zones within the Bay. To determine the level of impact on dolphin behaviour due to boat traffic, focal-group follows using a scan sample methodology were conducted from an independent research boat. A CATMOD analysis was used to determine dolphin behaviour by season, number of boats, and group size. Dolphin behaviour differed by boat number; in particular, resting behaviour decreased as boat number increased and milling behaviour increased as boat number increased. Behaviour differed when the research boat was the only boat present. Closer examination of boat type, i.e., permitted dolphin watching boats, non-permitted tour boats, and recreational boats, found a difference in dolphin behaviour in the presence of the permitted boats when compared to the other types. Dolphins rested less and engaged in more milling behaviour when the permitted boats were present. Responses to swim attempts from the commercial boats were compared from 1994 - 1995 to 1997 - 1998. In total, 255 groups were encountered of which 36% (n = 93) were exposed to at least one swim attempt. Successful swims (i.e., where at least one dolphin remained within 5 m of at least one swimmer) decreased from 48% in 1994 - 1995 to 34% in 1997 - 1998 and avoidance responses increased from 22% to 31%. Dolphin response varied according to swimmer placement from the boats. The &#8216;in path&#8217; placement had the highest level of avoidance. Only &#8216;line abreast&#8217; placement resulted in a decrease in avoidance. Based on the photo-identification sighting records, it was estimated that an average dolphin was exposed to 31 swim attempts per year. This suggests that individual dolphins have, with cumulative experience, become sensitised to swim attempts. If a swim attempt was successful, on average, it involved 19% of the group. Juveniles were more likely to interact with swimmers than adults. The present study suggests that the wide-ranging population of bottlenose dolphins that frequents the Bay of Islands is exposed to levels of tourism which can affect the dolphins behaviour. In particular, the permitted boats&#8217; presence results in decreased resting behaviour by the dolphins. The apparent sensitisation of this population to swim attempts, and the relatively small number of individual dolphins that interact with swimmers, are grounds for concern about the long-term impact of interactions. Ongoing monitoring of this populations&#8217; response to swimmers and boats, combined with a precautionary approach to management of boats and swimmers, are recommended.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270700 Ecology and Evolution::270702 Marine and estuarine ecology (incl. marine ichthyology)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/355</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Therapeutic effects of massage on coping with stress and migraine: a self-regulatory perspective</field><field name="creator">Lawler, Sheleigh Patricia</field><field name="description">Massage therapy, now considered a complementary therapy has seen growing interest and popularity in both research and use by the general population. Firstly, this thesis aimed to extend the research investigating the beneficial effects of massage therapy by developing and assessing an integrative model of massage effects on stress, coping, and physiological processes by using Leventhal&#8217;s Common Sense Model (CSM) of the self-regulation of behaviour. Secondly, this thesis aimed to investigate the duration of massage effects by including assessment periods past the last day of intervention and measures of coping efficacy and perceived stress. The first study investigated the effects of massage therapy (compared to a television activity) on perceived stress, coping efficacy, sleep, and health variables in students leading up to final examinations. Results revealed that massage was more effective than the television activity in reducing perceived stress and improving coping efficacy. The second study extended the first study by investigating the effects of massage (compared to a daily diary control group) for migraine sufferers, as migraine is exacerbated by stress and a stressful condition to manage. Results revealed that the massage group exhibited a reduction in migraine frequency, fatigue, and improved sleep quality, compared to the daily diary control group. The integrated CSM was further extended in the second study to investigate how the physiological processes of migraine may interact with migraine mechanisms. In both studies, the massage group revealed a significant decrease in immediate measures of heart rate and state anxiety from pre- to post-massage. The migraine massage group also exhibited decreases in salivary cortisol from pre-to post-massage. The findings are consistent with the integrated CSM of massage and self-regulation of behaviour, highlighting that massage can be a useful emotional regulation strategy through its influence on perceived stress, coping efficacy, and physiological processes. Immediate massage effects revealed reductions in state anxiety, and other physiological stress processes (heart rate and cortisol), and these changes may lead to alterations in cognitive appraisals of stressors, thus impacting on coping efficacy. Given the potential benefits identified in these two studies as well as previous massage research, an anonymous survey was conducted with general practitioners (GPs) and patients in the Auckland area to explore their attitudes, beliefs, and use of massage therapy and other complementary therapies. Results revealed that GPs regularly recommend patients see a massage therapist, and the majority of patients reported using massage in the previous year, most commonly for stress and musculoskeletal problems. The majority of GPs would like to see regulatory standards implemented for complementary medicine.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/356</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The vertical distribution of atmospheric BrO from ground-based measurements</field><field name="creator">Schofield, Robyn</field><field name="description">Ground-based UV-Visible measurements targeting BrO were made at Lauder, New Zealand (45.0&#176;S, 169.7&#176;E) and Arrival Heights, Antarctica (77.8&#176;S, 166.7&#176;E). Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (DOAS) was used to determine differential slant column densities (DSCDs) from the radiance measurements. UV-Visible measurements have been made in the two complementary viewing geometries of direct-sun and zenith-sky. A spherical curved earth single scattering radiative transfer model was developed. The effects of refraction, molecular absorption, Rayleigh and Mie scattering were included. Singularity at the tangent point was avoided and a complete intensity calculation performed. The DSCDs for both the direct-sun and zenith-sky viewing measurements were calculated with this forward model. A general optimal estimation retrieval algorithm was developed to retrieve altitude information by combining DSCDs from the direct-sun and zenith-sky viewing geometries. A complete retrieval characterisation and error analysis was performed. The characterisation illustrated that tropospheric sensitivity was obtained from the direct-sun viewing measurements, while the zenith-sky measurements were essential for stratospheric sensitivity. Stratospheric and tropospheric BrO columns were retrieved for the diurnal stages of 80&#176;, 84&#176; and 87&#176; SZA for Lauder. The diurnal and seasonal variation of the stratospheric column was successfully retrieved from the measurements. The stratospheric columns were consistent with a stratospheric Bry loading of 20 ppt. The tropospheric BrO column retrieved over Lauder was less than 0.9 ppt if a uniform distribution throughout the troposphere is assumed. This is consistent with, though lower than, previous estimates of BrO in the free troposphere of 0.5-2.0 ppt (Richter et al., 2002). The results of a ten week measurement campaign at Arrival Heights for the spring 2002 are presented. Stratospheric and tropospheric BrO columns were retrieved at 80&#176;, 84&#176; and 88&#176; SZA. A high variability was observed for the retrieved stratospheric columns, due in part to the unusual stratospheric warming in the Antarctic spring 2002 (Allen et al., 2003). A mean ubiquitous tropospheric background of 0.3 ppt was retrieved. Also a &#8216;bromine explosion&#8217; event was observed, corresponding to a BrO mixing ratio of 7 ppt for a uniformly mixed boundary layer.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/357</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cardiac electro-mechanics: from CellML to the whole heart</field><field name="creator">Nickerson, David Phillip</field><field name="description">We have developed a computational modelling and simulation framework for cardiac electromechanics which for the first time tightly couples cellular, tissue, and whole heart modelling paradigms. Application of the framework has been demonstrated in simulations of the electrical activation and mechanical contraction of cardiac myocytes, myocardial tissue, and models of ventricular structure and function. The framework has been implemented as part of the CMISS computational modelling environment. This allows for detailed specification of tissue microstructure and the variation of cellular models and their material parameters over a geometric domain of interest. Through previous work in CMISS we have access to a large pool of existing models and methods on which to base this work. A key aspect of our framework is the implementation of methods allowing the dynamic specification of mathematical models at run-time using CellML &#8211; an XML language designed to store and exchange computer based biological models. We use these methods to enable the specification of cellular level models using CellML, thus providing a very powerful method to simply &#8220;plug&#8221; cellular models into the distributed tissue and organ level models. While in this work we have developed specific cellular models, and their CellML description, the framework is now developed to the point where a non-expert user could pull out a given model and plug-in their own model. This allows cellular modellers to develop their models and then bring them into a distributed model of tissue or organ physiology. We present a review of cellular electrophysiology and mechanics models. As a demonstration of the ability of CellML to describe cardiac cellular models in a computationally useful manner we have encoded the majority of these models into CellML. The CellML descriptions of these models are provided as they were used in the computational simulations which generated all results presented for the models directly from the CellML encoded models. While the work described in this thesis focuses on cardiac electro-mechanics, the framework has much wider applicability. As such, this work forms the beginning of a generalised simulation framework for the IUPS Physiome Project, with the goal being models describing entire organisms from proteins through to organ systems.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/358</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Convergence of Lyapounov Functions Along Trajectories of Nonexpansive Semigroups: Generic Convergence and Stability</field><field name="creator">Choudhary, Renu</field><field name="description">The main aim of this thesis is to study the convergence of Lyapounov functions along the trajectories of nonexpansive semigroups in a Hilbert space. The outline of the thesis is as follows. In Chapter 3, it is shown that a regularly Lyapounov function for a semigroup of contractions on a Hilbert space converges to its minimum along the trajectories of the semigroup. In Chapter 4, we show that while a convex Lyapounov function for a semigroup of contractions on a Hilbert space may not converge to its minimum along the trajectories of the semigroup, it converges generically along the trajectories of the semigroups generated by a class of bounded perturbations of the semigroup generator. In Chapter 5, we show that the regularly Lyapounov function nearly converges to its minimum along the trajectories of the semigroups generated by small bounded perturbations of the semigroup generator. Besides that we study a problem of interest in its own right, about the direction of movement of the element of minimal norm in a moving convex set, in Section 4.9. We show that if C is a nonempty closed convex subset of a real Hilbert space H, e is a non-zero arbitrary vector in H, and for each t &#1028; R, z(t) is the closest point in C + te to the origin, then the angle z(t) makes with e is a decreasing function of t while z(t) &#8800; 0.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Lyapounov functions, Generic convergence, Semigroups,</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/361</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Negative masking and the units problem in audition</field><field name="creator">Shepherd, Daniel</field><field name="description">For humans with adequately operating auditory systems the arrival of acoustic waves to the ear and the subsequent displacement of the tympanic membrane gives rise to the sensations and perceptions commonly known as hearing. One aspect of hearing is loudness, to which the field of psychophysics attempts to ascribe a physical correlate intrinsic to the incoming acoustic wave. For over 50 years psychophysicists have attempted to explicitly define the just-noticeable difference (JND) for loudness: the smallest amount, in physical units, that a stimulus needs to be increased to produce a perceptual difference. A review of the literature suggests that the problem in defining the JND is twofold. Firstly there is the measurement problem, with specific weighting on two competing measures of the JND: the level difference (&#916;L) vs. the Weber fraction (&#916;X/X). Deciding between the two measures has proved difficult: within the natural operating range of the auditory system the two measures are directly proportional to one another. Secondly there is the units problem, concerned with the physical unit in which the measure should be expressed. The units problem exists because it has yet to be determined which property of the acoustic stimulus accounts for the perception of loudness. There are several candidates: acoustic pressure (p); acoustic intensity (I); acoustic power (P), and acoustic energy (E). The necessity of determining which, if any, is the proper measure of the stimulus is forced by the phenomenon of negative masking, which is manifest when the stimulus is expressed in terms of pressure. Selecting among the various quantities is complicated by the fact that the four measures are linearly related and constitute a direct transformation of one another. In the laboratory context existing techniques can produce stimuli that severely challenge the auditory system and break down the proportionality exhibited by the various candidate JNDs. These techniques however require greater scrutiny and development. Buus and Florentine (1991) have proposed that the JND measure (i.e., &#916;p/p, &#916;I/I, &#916;L) that realizes a linear relationship with the detectability index, d&#8217;, is the correct measure. The proportionality of the measures makes such comparison complicated, and threshold values need to be inflated by manipulating stimulus parameters in order to exceed the range of proportionality. This is accomplished using short duration (10-ms) sinusoids and low level masking noise. The experimental program commenced with a series of negative masking experiments to ensure the phenomenon is still relevant to short duration stimuli. Laming&#8217;s (1986) sensory analytical model, which assumes the auditory system responds to pressure, provided an acceptable fit to these data. Experiments on the pedestal effect, a related phenomenon, generated fixed-increment functions that could be compared to the masking functions generated from the negative masking data. A consistent relationship between the two was found when the stimuli were expressed in units of pressure. Attention then turned to improving the studies undertaken by Buus and Florentine (1991) to determine what the proper measure of the JND should be. A series of experiments, differentiated by stimulus conditions, suggest a JND measure expressed in pressure units had the most linear relationship with d&#8217;. The results argue for pressure as the correct measure of the stimulus, and &#916;p/p to be the most qualified representative of the JND.

Accountability for public safety in nurse education</field><field name="creator">Stokes, Gillian</field><field name="description">Nursing students assessed as being unsafe by nurse educators present specific challenges in tertiary education organisations. Nurse educators and education administrators are required by law to respect the rights of students to receive education, if it is deemed they will benefit from it. As registered nurses, nurse educators are also required by law to protect the public from unsafe nursing practice. The focus of this study is the management of unsafe nursing students within the tertiary education context. The moral dilemmas experienced by nurse educators, specifically linked to the issue of accountability for public safety, are explored. The theoretical framework for the thesis is informed by the two moral voices of justice and care identified by Gilligan and further developed using the work of Hekman and Lyotard. Case study methodology was used and data were collected from three schools of nursing and their respective educational organisations. Interviews were conducted with nurse educators and education administrators who had managed unsafe nursing students. Interviews were also conducted with representatives from the Nursing Council of New Zealand and the New Zealand Nurses Organisation to gain professional perspectives regarding public safety, nurse education and unsafe students. Transcripts were analysed using the strategies of categorical aggregation and direct interpretation. Issues identified in each of the three case studies were examined using philosophical and theoretical analyses. This thesis explores how students come to be identified as unsafe and the challenges this posed within three educational contexts. The justice and care moral voices of nurse educators and administrators and the ways in which these produced different ways of caring are made visible. Different competing and conflicting discourses of nursing and education are revealed, including the discourse of safety - one of the language games of nursing. The way in which participants positioned themselves and positioned others within these discourses are identified. Overall, education administrators considered accountability for public safety to be a specific professional, nursing responsibility and not a concern of education per se. This thesis provides an account of how nurse educators attempted to make the educational world safe for patients, students, and themselves. Participants experienced different tensions and moral dilemmas in the management of unsafe students, depending upon the moral language games they employed and the dominant discourse of the educational organisation. Nurse educators were expected to use the discourses of education to make their case and manage unsafe students. However, the discourses of nursing and education were found to be incommensurable and so the moral dilemmas experienced by nurse educators were detected as differends. This study bears witness to these differends.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/360</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Seismic performance of a post-tensioned concrete masonry wall system</field><field name="creator">Wight, Gavin D</field><field name="description">This thesis describes the development of a post-tensioned concrete masonry (PCM) wall system designed using generic materials. PCM walls derive their lateral strength and self-centering behaviour from unbonded post-tensioning. During in-plane loading, a horizontal crack forms at the wall base, which minimises masonry tensile strains and associated wall damage. An extensive literature review identified numerous instances where PCM has been used in projects worldwide, and this is reflected in the growing presence of the technology in international masonry codes. However, the lack of knowledge associated with seismic behaviour has resulted in limited use of this material in seismic zones. Although recent studies have begun to address this through pseudo-static testing, there remained a clear need to investigate the dynamic performance of such walls. Pseudo-static testing of two partially grouted PCM walls demonstrated the suitability of this system for residential structures in seismic areas. A subsequent shake table test series investigated the response of rectangular walls, walls with openings and a shrinkage control joint. The series concluded with the testing of a simple square structure that investigated multiple openings and wall corners. Rocking was shown to be the predominant deformation component, with minimal residual displacements at the conclusion of testing. Damage was restricted to the lower wall corners and above and below openings. Equations provided in international masonry codes for estimating the tendon stress at the nominal strength limit state were shown to be inappropriate for in-plane walls. A new expression was developed based on test results and finite element modelling, and was shown to provide improved accuracy, permitting the complete monotonic response of PCM walls to be predicted with excellent accuracy. An investigation into the creep and shrinkage properties of PCM demonstrated that prestress losses can be significant and must be considered in design. A displacement based design method for post-tensioned masonry walls was developed and demonstrated using a design example. The widely used bracing design method for reinforced masonry structures was adapted for PCM walls and utilised in the design of New Zealand's first post-tensioned concrete masonry house.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/362</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Population structure and genetic variation in Hector&#8217;s dolphin (Cephalorhynchus hectori)</field><field name="creator">Pichler, Franz</field><field name="description">This thesis uses molecular genetics as a tool to uncover information about the population structure and genetic variation in Hector&#8217;s dolphin (Cephalorhynchus hectori), to track population declines and to assess the evolutionary origins and taxonomic status of this species. A high-resolution genetic analysis of population structure was considered important for the determination of population boundaries and delimitation of conservation management units due to potentially unsustainable fisheries-related mortality. Population structure and dispersal rates were assessed using 281 samples collected from individual Hector&#8217;s dolphins of ten population groups representing the known geographic range of this species. Variation among mitochondrial DNA sequences (&#934;ST = 0.545) and microsatellite allele frequencies at six loci (RST = 0.252) indicated the presence of four genetically isolated regional populations, North Island (n = 29), East Coast South Island (n = 110), West Coast South Island (n = 122) and South Coast South Island (n = 19). Significant levels of genetic differentiation were not detected within local sub-populations of the East Coast and West Coast regional populations. However, the estimated geneflow between these sub-populations fitted a one-dimensional stepping-stone model (r2 = 0.6225) suggesting a vulnerability of local populations to fragmentation. A measure of expected mtDNA diversity (Tajima&#8217;s D statistic) suggested decline in eight of the ten populations. Microsatellite heterozygosity was also lower than expected in the East Coast and North Island regions, suggesting either further regional sub-structuring (Wahlund effect), loss of diversity due to population decline or the presence of null alleles. Examination of all Hector&#8217;s dolphin museum specimens of known origin (n = 55) enabled comparison of historic (1870 - 1987) genetic diversity to contemporary (1988 &#8211; 1999) diversity in two regional populations to assess the possibility that these populations have undergone recent declines. Over the last 20 years the North Island population has been reduced from at least three lineages (h = 0.41) to a single lineage (h = 0, p &lt; 0.05). The diversity of the East Coast, South Island population has declined significantly from h = 0.65 to h = 0.35 (p &lt; 0.05). These results suggest that the low abundance currently observed is due to recent population declines and that the North Island population is threatened with extinction in the near future. Based on a trend analysis of the mtDNA, it can be predicted that the East Coast South Island population may lose all mtDNA diversity within the next 20 years. Alternatively, detection of a one dimensional dispersal pattern may indicate that some populations are at risk of extirpation while others may not be in decline. If this is the case then the East Coast regional population is at risk of fragmentation. On a wider evolutionary scale, Hector&#8217;s dolphin is one of four species of the genus Cephalorhynchus, all of which suffer fisheries&#8211;related mortality. To describe the origin and radiation of these species, 485 bp of the mitochondrial DNA control region was sequenced from 320 individuals (including previously sequenced 200 Hector&#8217;s dolphins) representing nine of the ten species in the sub-family Lissodelphininae. The hypotheses that either Cephalorhynchus is a monophyletic genus or that the four species have arisen separately from pelagic Lissodelphine species and have converged morphologically were tested. The mtDNA phylogeny supported the monophyly of the genus and suggested that the genus Cephalorhynchus originated in the waters of South Africa and, following the West Wind Drift, colonised New Zealand and then South America. Secondary radiations resulting in two genetically isolated populations were found for the Kerguelen Island Commerson&#8217;s dolphin and the North Island Hector&#8217;s dolphin. A comparison of the genetic differentiation between the Commerson&#8217;s dolphins of the Kerguelen Islands (n = 11) and the coast of South America (n = 35), and between the North Island (n = 14) and South Island (n = 185) Hector&#8217;s dolphins, was conducted in order to assess the conservation and taxonomic status of these populations. A single fixed substitution in the mtDNA control region was diagnostic for the Kerguelen Island compared to South America (FST = 0.306, &#934;ST = 0.602) and the North Island compared to the South Island (FST = 0.442, &#934;ST = 0.495). Population differentiation of four microsatellite alleles (including unique alleles in each of the four populations) between the Kerguelen Island and South American Commerson&#8217;s dolphin (FST = 0.036, RST = 0.0493) and between the North and South Island Hector&#8217;s dolphins (FST = 0.391, RST = 0.3197) indicated restricted nuclear as well as maternal geneflow. These data, combined with additional evidence of morphological and geographic isolation, indicated that the Kerguelen Island Commerson&#8217;s dolphin and the North Island Hector&#8217;s dolphin are likely to be reproductively isolated from their alternate con-specific populations. Examination of various species concepts and definitions of conservation units leads to the conclusion that these four populations should each be considered unique at the subspecies level for the purposes of management, protection and evolutionary potential. These results lead to the conclusion that the Hector&#8217;s dolphin consists of highly subdivided populations. As a result of this and a low reproductive potential, Hector&#8217;s dolphin populations are vulnerable to extirpation through even low levels of human induced mortality. To manage such populations, it is appropriate to consider each of the two islands as separate sub-species. Within the South Island, the populations may be further subdivided into three demographically independent Management Units &#8211; the East, West and South Coasts. The South Coast management unit is vulnerable due to its low abundance and isolation and requires further investigation. Population modelling will need to reflect the fact that the local populations within the East and West coast regions share only limited dispersal with immediately adjacent populations and are thus susceptible to fragmentation. These results also show that the population declines of the East Coast South Island and the North Island populations are of recent origin thus implicating fisheries-related mortality as the principal threat to Hector&#8217;s dolphin. To prevent further decline or fragmentation of South Island populations more stringent control of inshore gillnet fisheries is required. By contrast, current decline of the North Island population may be a result of inbreeding depression. Given the low abundance and rapid decline of the North Island population, it is imperative to evaluate the potential for inbreeding depression while continuing to mitigate all human-related threats.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270700 Ecology and Evolution::270702 Marine and estuarine ecology (incl. marine ichthyology)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/363</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Between deference and self-assurance: reconciling realism and response-dependence</field><field name="creator">Bowell, Tracy Amanda</field><field name="description">This thesis deals with response-dependence accounts of concepts - concepts the extensions of which are determined by our responses under certain conditions - and the possibility of realist construals of practices involving such concepts. Drawing attention to distinctions between different types of response-dependent concepts, Chapter I proposes an account of response-dependence that recognises a variegation of types of concept that can plausibly be identified as response-dependent. Chapter II continues the development of this account by considering matters relevant to the form and content of the biconditional theorems (basic equations) of which responsedependence accounts are comprised. The account I propose in these first two chapters attempts to abstract from the details of existing accounts. Nevertheless, the middle section of the thesis &#8211; Chapters III, IV, V and VI &#8211; provide critical exegeses of response-dependence accounts developed by three authors &#8211; Mark Johnston&#8217;s Response-Dispositionalism, Philip Pettit&#8217;s Global Response-Dependence account of basic concepts and Crispin Wright&#8217;s Order of Determination distinction - accounts that have been fundamental to and influential in the literature on response dependence. Consideration of Crispin Wright&#8217;s realism relevant distinctions provides a bridge to Chapter VII where I undertake a detailed analysis of realism, according to which realism is recognised as an array of commitments that are best understood as organised within three distinctive and largely independent clusters &#8211; semantic, ontic and epistemic. Finally, in Chapter VIII we are able to effect a productive engagement between realism, understood according to the taxonomic exercise undertaken in Chapter VII, and response-dependence, understood according to the account developed and promoted in Chapters I and II, an engagement that results in a more fine-grained and sophisticated analysis of the prospects for a reconciliation of realism and response-dependence than has yet appeared in the literature.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/364</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ecological factors associated with speciation in New Zealand triplefin fishes (Family Tripterygiidae)</field><field name="creator">Wellenreuther, Maren</field><field name="description">Theoretical research has demonstrated that ecological interactions in sympatry or parapatry can generate disruptive selection that in concert with assortative mating can lead to speciation. However, empirical examples are few and restricted to terrestrial and lacustrine systems. New Zealand triplefin fishes (Family Tripterygiidae) are an ideal model system to study speciation in the sea, as they conform to the criteria of an adaptive radiation, being philopatric, speciose and abundant, and having largely sympatric distributions. This thesis investigates two key aspects of the New Zealand triplefin radiation: 1) which ecological traits are under selection?; and 2) which traits are potentially available for the development of assortative mating? Habitat use was identified as a possible key trait for selection and investigated in detail in this thesis. Habitat use of the majority of New Zealand triplefin species was censused quantitatively throughout most of their latitudinal range and analysed using novel statistical methods. Analyses showed that habitat use was highly divergent between species and thus diversification in habitat may have been a major component in the evolution of this clade. The phylogenetic analysis of habitat characters confirmed that there has been rapid evolution in habitat use among species. Habitat selection at settlement was highly species-specific, indicating that interspecific differences in adult habitat use may be the outcome of active habitat choice established at settlement. These species-specific habitat associations showed no evidence for geographic variation in habitat use. Laboratory trials and field observations of the sister-species pair Ruanoho decemdigitatus and R. whero showed that competition was linked with body size, with R. decemdigitatus being the larger and consequently dominant species. The second part of this thesis investigated which traits may have contributed to prezygotic isolation, and thus to assortative mating. Little evidence was found for divergence in breeding season or male colour patterns. However, divergence in habitat affected breeding habitat choice, as triplefins court and mate in the same territory as that occupied year round. This suggests that assortative mating in New Zealand triplefin species could be the by-product of adaptation to habitat resources. Body size affected mate choice and time at first maturity in the Ruanoho sister-species pair, suggesting that size is important in the maintenance of reproductive isolation in these species. Differences in body size may have also lead to assortative mating in other New Zealand triplefin sister-species pairs, as all sister-species pairs differ in maximum body size. The findings of this thesis invoke a strong role for ecologically-based selection in speciation, and support the hypothesis that adaptation to habitat has been a major factor in speciation in this system.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Research Subject Categories::NATURAL SCIENCES::Biology::Terrestrial, freshwater and marine ecology::Marine ecology</field><field name="subject">Research Subject Categories::NATURAL SCIENCES::Biology::Terrestrial, freshwater and marine ecology::Marine ecology</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270700 Ecology and Evolution::270702 Marine and estuarine ecology (incl. marine ichthyology)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/407</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Laterality and interhemispheric transfer in schizophrenia</field><field name="creator">Barnett, Kylie</field><field name="description">There is a plethora of research describing dysfunction of a single hemisphere (usually the left) in schizophrenia, while there is less evidence to suggest right-hemisphere dysfunction. There is also much evidence to suggest that individuals with schizophrenia have difficulties integrating information between the two cerebral hemispheres or transferring information between the hemispheres. The aim of this thesis was to investigate lateralized and interhemispheric information processing in males with predominantly negative-symptom schizophrenia. This thesis employs behavioural (i.e. computer-based reaction-time tasks), neuropsychological (i.e. the line-bisection task) and electrophysiological (i.e. electroencephalogram) measures to assess laterality and interhemispheric processing in schizophrenia relative to matched controls. In Experiment 1, the Poffenberger (1912) paradigm was used to compare the difference between &#8220;crossed&#8221; (stimuli and motor response areas are contralateral) and &#8220;uncrossed&#8221; (stimuli and motor response areas are ipsilateral) conditions to estimate interhemispheric transfer time. Simple reaction time (RT) was recorded to stimuli presented unilaterally or bilaterally in participants who responded using either the left or right hand. While the results provide no evidence for differences between the groups in information transfer or integration between the hemispheres, the schizophrenia group was significantly slower to respond to LVF stimuli, suggesting right-hemisphere dysfunction. In Experiment 2, bilateral gain was assessed using a lexical-decision task where word or non-word judgments were made to letter strings presented in the LVF, RVF, or BVF. The schizophrenia group showed normal lateralization of language to the left hemisphere, but unlike controls who showed a bilateral gain (decrease in RT), they were actually disadvantaged when two stimuli were presented simultaneously to both hemispheres. In Experiment 3, the linebisection task (see Appendix A) was used to estimate right-hemisphere visuospatial processing. The schizophrenia group showed a rightward bias under certain conditions, for example when lines were positioned on the right side of the page, when the right hand was used, and when a right-to-left scan was adopted suggesting a deficit in the transfer of visuospatial information. In Experiment 4, interhemispheric transfer was investigated using 128-channel EEG as a direct measure. Evoked potentials (EPs) were obtained while participants performed the Poffenberger task. The N160 was measured from homologous occipital sites to assess transfer latency in milliseconds. While controls had faster information transfer from the right hemisphere to the left hemisphere, this asymmetry of transfer was absent in the schizophrenia group who had similar transfer speeds in both directions, i.e. &#8216;symmetry of transfer&#8217;. Similarly, in Experiment 5, the schizophrenia group failed to show faster transfer of linguistic information (words and non-words) from the right hemisphere to the left. In both EEG tasks the schizophrenia group showed a concomitant decrease in the amplitude of the N160 that was marked over the right hemisphere. This suggests that right-hemisphere dysfunction, rather than callosal dysfunction may better explain interhemispheric deficits in schizophrenia. Results are discussed with reference to Miller&#8217;s (1996) hypothesis regarding differences in cerebral hemispheric specialization and axonal conduction delays. These findings suggest that righthemisphere dysfunction may be associated with negative symptoms in males with schizophrenia.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/365</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Speaking up in court: repair and powerless language in New Zealand courtrooms</field><field name="creator">Innes, Bronwen M.</field><field name="description">Law courts purport to be seats of justice, yet there is constant debate about the evenhandedness of that justice and ordinary people&#8217;s access to it. This thesis reports on a study of seven criminal hearings in the District Court in Auckland, New Zealand. The study focussed on repair (as defined in conversation analysis) and various phenomena which have been identified previously as characteristic of &#8220;powerless language&#8221; (that is, the speech used by those in subordinate positions to their social superiors). These phenomena included hesitations, hedges, intensifiers, witnesses asking questions, tag questions, high rising terminal intonation, polite terms, terms of address and well. The results of the analysis have led to two interesting conclusions. First, traditionally linguists have considered repair as a means of dealing with problems. As such, repair itself has often been thought of as a problem. As far as these seven hearings are concerned, it is evident that repair is being used as a highly effective interactional resource in the process of &#8220;coming to an understanding&#8221; which seems to me to be the basis of courtroom interaction. Second, the study calls the notion of powerless language into question. While it is true that many researchers have found that people evaluate powerless language negatively, this study finds that a) the features which have been said to form the powerless style in English are not used only by the powerless people in these hearings and b) these features cannot always or necessarily be said to operate in a powerless manner during the hearings. The analysis has produced a more detailed account of the features and their use than previous studies have achieved. The results show that the notion of powerless language is highly questionable. This in turn means that further study is necessary into how people make judgements on language use and what role such judgements play in the decisions of juries.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/366</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Bayesian Strategies for Gravitational Radiation Data Analysis</field><field name="creator">Umstaetter, Richard</field><field name="description">This work addresses the exploration of Bayesian MCMC methods applied to problems in gravitational wave physics. The thesis consists of two parts. In the first part a Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo technique is presented for estimating the astrophysical parameters of gravitational radiation signals from a neutron star in laser interferometer data. This computational algorithm can estimate up to six unknown parameters of the target, including the rotation frequency and frequency derivative, using reparametrization, delayed rejection and Metropolis-Coupled Markov Chain Monte Carlo. Results will be given for different synthesized data sets in order to demonstrate the algorithm&#8217;s behaviour for different observation lengths and signal-to-noise ratios. The probability of detecting weak signals is assessed by a model comparison, based on the BIC, between a model that postulates a signal and one that postulates solely noise within the data. The second part of the thesis adresses the tremendous data analysis challenges for the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) with the need to account for a large number of gravitational wave signals from compact binary systems expected to be present in the data. The basis of a Bayesian method is introduced that can address this challenge, and its effectiveness is demonstrated on a simplified problem involving one hundred synthetic sinusoidal signals in noise. The reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo technique is deployed to infer simultaneously the number of signals present, the parameters of each identified signal, and the noise level. This approach is specifically focused on the detection of a large number of sinusoids with separation of sinusoids that are close in frequency. A robust post-processing technique handles the label switching problem by a frequency interval separation technique with a subsequent classification according to a mixed model approximation. The algorithm therefore tackles the detection and parameter estimation problems simultaneously, without the need to evaluate formal model selection criteria, such as the Akaike Information Criterion or explicit Bayes factors. The method produces results which compare very favorably with classical spectral techniques.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/377</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Assessment of Systemic Blood Flow in the Newborn Infant</field><field name="creator">Groves, Alan Martin</field><field name="description">Preterm infants are vulnerable to brain injury which is thought to be caused partly by abnormalities in cerebral perfusion. However the accurate assessment of cerebral and general systemic perfusion remains a challenge in the newborn infant. Commonly used clinical parameters such as blood pressure and blood lactate concentrations are imperfect predictors of blood flow. Cardiac output measurements used in older children do not reflect true systemic perfusion in the neonate due to shunting of blood through persisting fetal pathways. Echocardiographic measurements of descending aortic (DAo) and superior vena caval (SVC) blood flow may provide more reliable assessment of neonatal systemic perfusion. This thesis evaluates these techniques in the first days of postnatal life. Measures of flow volume in the SVC and DAo were found to be feasible in the vast majority of infants, and were performed without significantly affecting cardiorespiratory status. Assessment of SVC flow volume showed similar repeatability to other measures of blood flow in neonates when assessed by a single observer, as did assessment of velocity of flow in the DAo. We then used these techniques to further assess the transitional circulation, and found no evidence of a positive association between arterial blood pressure and volume of systemic perfusion. Contrary to previous assumptions that ductal shunting compromises systemic perfusion, we found that left ventricular output tended to increase with increasing shunt through the ductus arteriosus, thereby maintaining upper, though not necessarily lower, body perfusion. There was an association between very low levels of flow in individuals and some adverse outcomes that had a strong circulatory component to their pathophysiology (periventricular haemorrhage and necrotising enterocolitis). However low blood flow in the SVC or DAo did not predict poor outcome within the entire cohort. Assessments of SVC and DAo flow in the neonate are feasible, relatively repeatable and have already enhanced our understanding of the pathophysiology of the transitional circulation. These and other techniques to monitor systemic blood flow in the neonate may aid identification of circulatory failure, act as short-term endpoints in clinical trials of interventions supporting the circulation, and eventually improve neurodevelopmental outcome in preterm infants.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/370</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Nabokov&#8217;s humor: the play of consciousness</field><field name="creator">Brillinger, Matthew</field><field name="description">Vladimir Nabokov' s fiction, particularly in its later stages, is thoroughly and multifariously humorous, with individual works incorporating large numbers of jokes to tremendous effect, to the point that enjoyment of Nabokov 's art is to some extent indistinguishable from engagement with his humor. Why is Nabokov 's art so robustly funny? Humor theorists, in varied words and with differing degrees of forcefulness, posit humor as necessarily presenting a possibility  - ontological, behavioral, circumstantial, or interpretative  - unforeseen by its audience, as a joke introduces that audience to a surprising entity, action, event or viewpoint. Nabokov, experiencing his own world as ceaselessly surprising, consciously deploys humor as a means of underscoring for readers the infinite possibilities available at each moment, utilizing jokes in the countering of divers types of expectation. Nabokov 's use of humor emerges from a well-considered theory of humor, while also reflecting a singular metaphysics. This thesis, as it maps the relationship between Nabokov 's use and theory of humor, offers a rationale for much of the humor on offer in Nabokov' s art, accounting for that humor by reference not only to its effects and implications but also to its significance in the eyes of Nabokov himself.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/367</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Wandering Jew as a synecdoche of anti-Jewish construction: a psychoanalytic perspective</field><field name="creator">Stroobant, Anthony David</field><field name="description">After around half a century of progress, Jewish-Christian relations seem to have reached a plateau. Among many possible reasons, it appears that good intentions at &#8220;official&#8221; church levels continue to be subverted by traditional Christian supersessionism, especially as manifest in the &#8220;performed&#8221; life of the church, and in relation to Jews and Judaism. The research generates a psychoanalytical understanding of Christian anti-Jewishness complementary to those from other fields, to try to understand more comprehensively its aetiology and why it manifests in such particular ways. The theoretical approach begins with Freud and the British Object Relations school, but includes perspectives from other streams of psychoanalysis, and from contemporary cognitive theory. Utilising an &#8220;applied&#8221; psychoanalytic reading of The Wandering Jew as a synecdoche of Christian anti-Jewishness, the research argues that performance of the church&#8217;s sacred texts (traditionally interpreted in anti-Jewish ways) connects, via unconscious association, with latent primal fears and anxieties of worshippers. It is this regular, uncritical performance of such texts that keeps a largely unconscious, affect-laden, contemporary anti-Jewishness alive. Understanding that &#8220;bodies&#8221; can bear powerful meanings, the research investigates the person of The Wandering Jew as a Christian anti-Jewish construction, and uncovers a number of psychoanalytically significant themes which closely relate to issues of human development. All of this, taken together, helps explain why Christian anti-Jewishness is often so passionately irrational, palpably incarnate, deep-rooted and difficult to educate against. The research concludes with two theoretical reflections. The first explores whether the idea of the analytic third might help towards a better understanding of the potency of Christian anti-Jewish fantasy. The second is a discussion of whether it is helpful, given anti- Jewishness is no longer generally understood as &#8220;psychopathological&#8221;, to think instead of Christian anti-Jewish construction as taking place on neurotic islands having cultures of narcissism and paranoia. The main implication of the research is that the church needs to take responsibility for its own anti-Jewishness which is what, in essence, is currently subverting better Jewish- Christian relations.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/369</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Structural Genomics of Mycobacterium tuberculosis</field><field name="creator">Johnston, Jodie Margaret</field><field name="description">In 1998 the genome sequence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv was published1.  M. tuberculosis is the primary causative agent of tuberculosis, a disease with a long history in humans, which still has a great impact on human mortality today.  As part of the M. tuberculosis Structural Genomics Consortium we selected nine target genes (Rv0534c (menA); Rv0548c (menB); Rv0553 (menC); Rv0555 (menD); Rv0542c (menE); Rv3853 (menG); Rv0558 (ubiE); Rv0989c (grcC2) and Rv0990c) from M. tuberculosis, including all known members of the menaquinone biosynthesis pathway, for structural studies.  All nine genes were taken through the structural genomics &#8220;pipeline&#8221;, either becoming stuck at various &#8220;bottlenecks&#8221; or continuing successfully to structure solution.  At the initial bioinformatics analysis step, eight of the nine targeted genes were deemed suitable for further study.  PCR amplification and cloning of these genes into several different expression vectors followed.  Expression of the gene products for the seven successfully cloned genes was undertaken in an E. coli expression host, followed by experiments (refolding, lysis buffer and expression temperature screens) aimed at obtaining soluble protein in sufficient quantities for crystallisation.  Of the seven proteins successfully overexpressed, five remain at this stage as they could not be obtained in soluble form.  The remaining two, Rv3853 (MenG), solubilised by refolding, and MenB, solubilised by 24&#186;C expression, were purified and both successfully produced diffracting crystals.  The crystal structure of Rv3853 was determined by isomorphous replacement (SIRAS) and refined at 1.9 &#197; resolution (R = 19.0% and Rfree = 22.0%).  The structure of several different crystal forms of MenB, were determined by molecular replacement.  Refinement of two of these structures, MenB_P43212 at 2.15&#197; resolution (R = 20.3% and Rfree = 23.1%) and MenB_C2-NCoA at 2.3 &#197; resolution (R = 19.7% and Rfree = 22.5%), has been completed. The structure of Rv3853, combined with the discovery that UbiE was more likely to catalyse the final, S-adenosylmethionine-dependent, methyltransfer step of menaquinone biosynthesis, led to the conclusion that Rv3853 had been misannotated as MenG.  Combined with further bioinformatics analysis the Rv3853 structure has been useful in providing new ideas as to the real function of Rv3853.  In contrast, the structure of MenB confirmed its place as a member of the crotonase superfamily although the C-terminus was located in a position not observed in other crotonase superfamily structures.  Several flexible regions likely to be important in MenB function have been identified by examination of the various MenB structures</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Structural genomics</field><field name="subject">tuberculosis</field><field name="subject">Mycobacterium tuberculosis</field><field name="subject">menaquinone biosynthesis</field><field name="subject">protein structure</field><field name="subject">biological sciences</field><field name="subject">structural biology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/379</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Antenna Selection and Deployment Strategies for Indoor Wireless Communication Systems</field><field name="creator">Wong, Alex H. C.</field><field name="description">Effective antenna selection and deployment strategies are important for reducing co-channel interference in indoor wireless systems. Low-cost solutions are essential, and strategies that utilise simple antennas (such as directional patches) are advantageous from this perspective. However, performance is always an issue and the improvements achievable through clever antenna deployment need to be quantified. In this thesis, an experimental investigation of indoor propagation comparing the performance of directional antennas and multiple-element arrays (MEAs) with omni-directional antennas is reported. Estimation of the performance of a direct sequence code division multiple access (DS-CDMA) system operating in a variety of deployment scenarios allows the identification of a range of performance-limiting factors and the optimal deployment strategies.  It is shown that the orientation of single-element directional antennas can significantly impact on system performance compared to omni-directional antennas in traditional systems. The deployment of MEAs with an active diversity combining scheme can further improve system performance by more than one order of magnitude. From the perspective of system planning, the choice of antenna selection and deployment options depends on the current and future demand for system performance and the financial resources available. An evolutionary path has been proposed to provide a smooth transition from conventional (low-cost) to high-performance (high-cost) antenna systems as demand dictates. Other performance-limiting factors in indoor wireless systems include the physical environment and external interference. It is also shown that electromagnetically-opaque obstacles in the environment can amplify the effectiveness of the antenna deployment by acting as physical zone boundaries that restrict interference. External interference has been shown to cause a significant degradation to the performance of an indoor system when the carrier-to-external-interference ratio (CEIR) is below 30 dB.

The objectives of this research were to: 1) Determine the identity of the rhizobial species nodulating the native legumes of New Zealand: Sophora (kowhai), Carmichaelia (NZ broom), and Clianthus (kakabeak); and the identity and origin of rhizobial species nodulating invasive exotic legumes in New Zealand: Ulex (gorse), Cytisus (broom), and Acacia (wattles). 2) Determine the specificity and nitrogen fixing capacity of both groups of rhizobia. 3) Investigate the possible exchange of transmissible symbiotic genetic elements. A polyphasic strategy was used to determine the identity of bacterial isolates. The 16S rRNA, atpD, recA, and glnII genes were PCR amplified and sequenced, then analysed by maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods. Phenotypic characters were also assessed by use of the Biolog and FAME techniques. Nodulation and fixation ability was assessed by inoculating legume seedlings with rhizobial strains, then determining nitrogenase activity after ten weeks by gas chromatography, and examining roots for nodules. A gene involved in symbiosis, nodA, was sequenced from rhizobial strains to determine if transmission between strains had occurred. The results of the experiments showed that the native legumes were predominately nodulated by diverse Mesorhizobium spp. that contain three different nodA genotypes (two of which are novel) that have transferred between rhizobial strains. The Mesorhizobium spp. showed little nodulation specificity and could nodulate an exotic legume Astragalus (milk vetch), but not the invasive weed legumes. Rhizobium leguminosarum was also found to nodulate native legumes, albeit ineffectively. The exotic invasive woody legumes of this study were nodulated by diverse Bradyrhizobium spp. that had nodA genotypes typical of Australian and European species. The origins of these bacteria can not be categorically determined. However the evidence is presented to suggest that nodulating Mesorhizobium spp. arrived with the ancestors of the native legumes, while Bradyrhizobium spp. nodulating Ulex and Cytisus arrived recently from Europe. Bradyrhizobium spp. nodulating Acacia may be recently introduced, possibly from Australia, although further work is required to confirm these hypotheses.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">rhizobia</field><field name="subject">native legumes</field><field name="subject">microbiology</field><field name="subject">mesorhizobium</field><field name="subject">bradyrhizobium</field><field name="subject">kowhai</field><field name="subject">sophora</field><field name="subject">rhizobium</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270400 Botany</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/394</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cartographies of childhood : mapping the modern/global child</field><field name="creator">Duhn, Iris</field><field name="description">Childhood in western societies is apparently at risk. In a globalised, interconnected world, &#8216;the child&#8217; is in danger of loosing its innocence too early &#8211; ideal childhood seems under threat like never before. In this thesis I argue that concerns over childhood and the ideal child are nothing new. Questions over what ideal childhood looks like have preoccupied the social and political imagination for centuries. Taking a poststructural approach, I investigate how childhood and the western modern child have been produced discursively. I argue that the modern child has been shaped by political rationalities that emphasise the child&#8217;s potential as resource &#8211; the ideal child is the child with promise. This ideal child is governed through its Other, the child as/at risk who marks the boundaries of ideal childhood. Modern childhood as a domain has been structured by the tensions that are created between the child with promise and the child as risk. The contemporary preoccupation with childhood is embedded in wider social, cultural and political shifts in postmodern/late-industrial society. It is the modern ideal of childhood that is at risk. This study takes an interdisciplinary approach to childhood studies to map the transformation of childhood over time. I argue that changes in contemporary discourses of childhood are effects of changes in political rationality.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/375</field></doc><doc><field name="title">"Turning the stone of being": Migrant Poetics in the Novels of Janet Frame</field><field name="creator">Haarhaus, Isabel</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/382</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Automatic Planning and Optimisation of In-building CDMA Systems</field><field name="creator">Wong, Joseph</field><field name="description">The placement of base stations is an important issue in planning wireless systems because it has a significant influence on overall system performance. In order to achieve good performance in an interference limited CDMA system, a large number of variables must be considered simultaneously during the planning stage. A traditional manual planning approach that involves an iterative application of analysis may not produce satisfactory results since it can only consider a small number of variables simultaneously. This thesis proposes the use of automatic optimisation that allows more variables to be considered and more solutions to be examined within the same time period. This thesis aims to produce a unique framework for creating an automatic optimisation tool for solving the CDMA base station placement problem. This framework contains a number of mathematical models that describe various deployment scenarios and a number of customised optimisation algorithms that solve these models. Although the work presented in this thesis does not result in a complete design tool, the findings are expected to provide a solid foundation for the development of such a tool. During the course of study, a number of issues associated with the proposed planning approach have been discussed and some future research directions have been identified. The results from the example problems have shown that automatic optimisation has the potential to reduce the planning time significantly, assess system performance accurately and utilise limited resources efficiently. These benefits certainly confirm the need for such a tool and reinforce the importance of the work documented in this thesis.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Optimisation</field><field name="subject">linear programming</field><field name="subject">wireless</field><field name="subject">communications</field><field name="subject">interference</field><field name="subject">CDMA</field><field name="subject">base stations</field><field name="subject">planning</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/434</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Self-reflexivity and the construction of subjectivity in contemporary French cinema: Alain Resnais</field><field name="creator">Walker, Deborah A.</field><field name="description">ABSTRACT This study uses the work of French filmmaker, Alain RESNAIS (1922 - ) to examine the role of self-reflexivity in the construction of subjectivity within contemporary French cinema (from 1958 to the present day). Close analysis of self-reflexivity in its various forms - mise en abyme, intertextuality, the foregrounding of cinematographic and narrative conventions - reveals the construction of a new form of subjectivity. The self-reflexive gaze, in the films of Resnais as in such other &#8220;modernist&#8221; French filmmakers as Godard, Duras and Robbe-Grillet, constructs a decentred, fissured subject. This process is particularly evident in Resnais&#8217; subversion of mise en abyme, which, from a reflection in miniature of the work, becomes a refraction, a mise en &#233;cart that points toward both the alterity and the absence of origin at the heart of subjectivity. I propose that self-reflexivity in Resnais participates in a philosophical, deconstructive enterprise which serves to question the metaphysics of presence and explore the limits of representation and subjectivity. His work asks whether the subject is a free, self-constituting self-present agent or whether it is constructed by the Other, and to what extent this subject, whether author, character or spectator, can access or represent truth or reality. From Resnais&#8217; early work on, I argue, reality is shown to be, always, already, the result of a process of mediation by a subject also in process (en proc&#232;s), both constituted and constituting. Moreover, implicit in this view of subjectivity is an ethical injunction that closely relates to Derrida&#8217;s impossible ethics of deconstruction. Here the thesis aims to demonstrate that the radical questioning of the notion of the subject in Resnais closely parallels, and indeed, even anticipates the redrawing of the limits of subjectivity by contemporary structuralist and post-structuralist thought (late 1950s - early 1970s). For whereas the positivist, humanist subject of theory must die before it can be reborn in another form, in Resnais the process of transformation is immediate: a linguistic and an ethical turn take place in the same moment. The absence of grand narratives does not project the subject into a post-modern void. Thus, I argue that Resnais&#8217; self-reflexive film practice can serve as an innovative and positive model of post-modern subjectivity.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">fr</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/378</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Gee's territory: Pakeha society in the fiction of Maurice Gee</field><field name="creator">Dugdale, Sarah</field><field name="description">This thesis offers a detailed reading of the adult fiction of the New Zealand writer Maurice Gee in order to examine their representations of a settler community in a post-colonial society. The works of social historians, political economists and sociologists are used to make relevant connections between events and attitudes in the actual world and those portrayed in the novels. Observations are made on the overall condition of the Pakeha in New Zealand society at the end of the millennium. The Introduction discusses the current understanding of the post-settler position in post-colonial theory, and explains the use in the thesis of the term Pakeha to describe this position. The body of the thesis is divided into five chapters that roughly correspond with the final decades of the twentieth century. Each chapter discusses the two or three novels Maurice Gee published in each decade, starting with the little known novels from the 1960s, The Big Season and A Special Flower, and concluding with the three novels published during the 1990s. Working from the premise that the acknowledgement and understanding of the settler position is an important responsibility of the modern post-colonial society, the thesis argues that Gee's novels are a profound expression of the settler position in contemporary New Zealand, and that the uncertainty and hesitation revealed in each of them reflect a cultural anxiety underlying the settler consciousness. In the bibliography Gee's novels are acknowledged as the primary resource of the thesis, and the numerous books, articles, reviews and essays used to support the ideas proposed in the thesis &#8211; literary, historical, economic and sociological &#8211; are presented as secondary sources.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/380</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Regulation of the noradrenaline transporter in a model neuronal cell line: effects of cell signalllng pathways and the tricyclic antidepressant drug, desipramine</field><field name="creator">Wong, Chi Yan</field><field name="description">The noradrenaline transporter (NAT) is found in presynaptic noradrenergic nerve terminals. It regulates noradrenergic neurotransmission by mediating reuptake of noradrenaline (NA) from the synapse. The NAT is inhibited by the tricyclic antidepressant agent, desipramine (DMI). While a single dose of DMI rapidly inhibits noradrenaline reuptake, repeated administration is required for therapeutic effects. This thesis aimed to investigate whether DMI has cellular effects in addition to the inhibition of the NAT. To research this hypothesis, the effect of DMI on protein expression and regulation of the NAT in cultured neuronal cells was investigated. Short-term DMI treatment was shown to increase the expression of phosphorylated CREB in several mammalian neuronal cell lines, as shown by immunocytochemistry. These results were confirmed by western blotting in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells, but not for the other cell lines. Short-term DMI treatment also appeared to augment the expression of phosphorylated substrates of PKC and MAPK, as investigated by western blotting with kinase specific phospho-protein antibodies. However, there did not appear to be phosphoproteins expressed specifically in response to DMI. To study the regulation of the NAT, a stable human noradrenergic neuroblastoma cell line, SY5Y cells transfected to express a GFP-NAT fusion protein, was produced for this thesis work. SY5Y-GFP-NAT cells displayed a 3-5 fold increase in [3H]noradrenaline uptake with GFP-fluorescence localized to the plasma membrane. The level of GFP-NAT expression was sufficient for biotinylation analysis of surface NAT expression. SY5Y-GFP-NAT cells treated with the PKC activator &#946;-PMA showed a significant reduction in both [3H]noradrenaline uptake and surface GFP-NAT expression, confirming that the cell line was suitable for studies of NAT regulation. Treatment with muscarinic receptor agonists was found to reduce NAT activity. This effect was abolished by the depletion of PKC activity, suggesting that the signalling pathway involved PKC. Unlike the effect of &#946;-PMA, muscarinic agonists did not affect cell surface NAT expression. Regulation of the NAT by the insulin signalling pathway was investigated in SY5Y-GFPNAT cells. Insulin treatment robustly increased [3H]noradrenaline uptake, an effect blocked by the tyrosine kinase inhibitor, genistein. Genistein treatment alone significantly reduced noradrenaline uptake, suggesting insulin receptor tyrosine kinase regulated basal NAT activity. Further investigations suggested that insulin-dependent regulation of the NAT involved cross-talk between PKC and PI3K signalling pathways. DMI treatment of 1 to 3 days was shown to reduce cell surface NAT expression in the SY5Y-GFP-NAT cells. This was detected both by GFP fluorescence and surface protein biotinylation. Increased intracellular GFP-NAT was also observed in DMI-treated cells. GFP-NAT associated mostly with recycling endosomes after 1-day of DMI treatment, as shown by co-localization with transferrin conjugated to Alexa-568. GFP-NAT became associated with late endosomes and lysosomes after 2 &#8211; 3 days of DMI treatment. A model was developed to explain the effect of DMI on the cellular trafficking of the NAT. This research clearly demonstrated a novel finding, that the tricyclic antidepressant drug DMI, affects the cellular distribution of the NAT in the SY5Y-GFP-NAT model cell-line. While specific changes in protein expression in response to DMI were not found, it appears likely that regulation of the NAT by DMI treatment involves cell signalling pathways and post-translational protein modification. The SY5Y-GFP-NAT cell, developed during this research, is a novel cell-line that has proved its value for studies of the regulation and trafficking of the NAT. This cell line should be useful for future studies of potential transporter-protein interactions and additional studies of the cellular actions of DMI.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/381</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Accident or Design? New Theories on the unfinished Contrapunctus 14 in JS Bach's The Art of Fugue BWV 1080</field><field name="creator">Hughes, Indra Nicholas Martindale</field><field name="description">The literature about the unfinished ending of J S Bach&#8217;s The Art of Fugue (Die Kunst der Fuga) BWV 1080 is in universal agreement that the work remained unfinished at Bach&#8217;s death; some texts go a step further to say that it is unfinished because he died. After giving a series of performances of the work, the author became convinced that this latter view must be incorrect, and that Bach left the work unfinished deliberately. This thesis explores this idea in detail and, by presenting a number of new theories, suggests not only that Bach left the work unfinished deliberately as an invitation to the reader, student or performer to work out his or her own completion, but also that he left a number of clues, hidden to a greater or lesser extent, to indicate that that was his intention and to supply vital information about the content of the missing bars.   Divided into two parts, the thesis first considers some of the evidence contained within the manuscript itself, up to and including the final written bar, and then in the second part goes on to consider two essential aspects of the completion.   By way of introduction, the first chapter surveys the controversial area of Bach&#8217;s use of numbers in his music and draws attention to the number of the final bar, which can be interpreted as a clue to the fact that Bach expects the music to be continued.   Chapter Two invites a reconsideration of Christoph Wolff&#8217;s famous &#8220;Fragment X&#8221; theory, which suggests that the continuation of the final fugue was written on a separate, now lost, piece of paper. Many inconsistencies and details in the manuscript suggest strongly that Wolff&#8217;s theory is incorrect. As part of this theory, the author reports on his own examination of the original manuscript in Berlin.   Chapter Three, through a detailed study of the architecture of the final fugue, makes the bold claim that the author has definitively proved the exact number of bars required to complete the music in accordance with Bach&#8217;s intentions: this theory develops and refines the work of Gregory Butler in this area, and, to corroborate the theory, presents a possible interpretation of the unusual markings at the end of Bach&#8217;s score and of a significant correction made by Bach in his manuscript.   Finally, in Chapter Four, the question of the proposed inverted combination of all four fugue subjects is revisited &#8211; a combination that several writers have claimed to be impossible &#8211; and a new and convincing solution to this problem is presented and justified.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bach</field><field name="subject">Art of Fugue</field><field name="subject">Counterpoint</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/392</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Political participation of "Asian" New Zealanders : a case study of ethnic Chinese and Korean New Zealanders</field><field name="creator">Park, Shee-Jeong</field><field name="description">Politics is a numbers game. Having sufficient numbers is a prerequisite for any ethnic minority group to have political influence in a host country. But numbers are only a prerequisite &#8211; numbers do not automatically increase the group&#8217;s political power. Individual members of the group need to have sufficient resources, interest, knowledge, and the confidence to participate in politics in order for the group to transform its numbers into political power. Having strong ethnic communities and political parties that actively seek out minority voters can also facilitate this process by encouraging ethnic minority groups to participate in politics. But even with the right combination of these individual and community factors, without a liberal institutional structure which facilitates political participation, it would be difficult for any minority group to have adequate political representation in a host country. A study on the political participation of Asian New Zealanders proves that understanding ethnic minority groups&#8217; political participation is a complex yet interesting issue, which challenges various aspects of traditional theories on political participation. This thesis is a first in many ways. The thesis introduces Asians for the first time into the literature that seeks to explain what factors influence the political participation of people living in New Zealand. The thesis also introduces Asian New Zealanders for the first time into the international literature that seeks to explain what factors influence the political participation of Asian immigrants in Western democratic countries. The findings of the survey conducted as a part of the thesis indicate that Asian New Zealanders, as the newest and most rapidly growing segment of New Zealand society, provide an important and unique insight into our understanding of political participation, and that Asian New Zealanders are set to emerge as even more important players in New Zealand politics in the coming decade.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/393</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Management Rhetoric as Performance, Perspective and Persuasion: A Scriptive Reading of Management Theory Texts</field><field name="creator">Monin, Nanette</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/383</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Property Rights in Environmental Resources</field><field name="creator">Sheard, Murray</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the nature of property rights over environmentally sensitive resources and develops a new conception of property in these resources. It has implications for the design of property law, environmental law, and the ethical responsibilities of business in the use of resources. I pursue this project by examining arguments employed in the defence of the institution of private property. These arguments are, on one hand, the &#8220;original appropriation&#8221; arguments of John Locke (1632&#8211;1704) and modern versions of this, that appeal to ownership of one&#8217;s labour and, on the other hand, arguments that appeal to utility and economic efficiency. I show how the central intuitions of these arguments can be used to construct a theory of property in environmental resources. I argue that property rights do not conceptually conflict with duties of preservation and that they admit of more environmentally motivated restrictions than is often thought. They do not license uses that contribute unjustifiably to environmental hazards or that lower environmental quality below certain minimums. Government interventions in the form of land use planning, monitoring, and other activities are justified in principle. The public retains a say on legal limits to property use, reflecting the interest of the community. The conception of property that arises is a form of private ownership with an element of stewardship. I argue that this conception better captures the moral reasons that justify property than does a traditional &#8220;full liberal&#8221; conception. The account is sensitive to a plurality of justifying principles and a range of object types and gives flexibility within a property regime. It rewards labour and productivity while curbing the more destructive potential of unrestricted rights. I conclude the thesis with an application to the issue of climate change. I show that this conception of property gives the flexibility needed if necessary restraints on emissions are not to clash severely with property rights. I develop a proposal for fairly distributing the burdens of climate change mitigation.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/384</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Out for the count: the last alternative state high school in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Vaughan, Karen</field><field name="description">This thesis is based on a five-year case study of Auckland Metropolitan College ("Metro"), the only state-funded alternative secondary school in New Zealand. At the time of writing in September 2001, the school teeters on the brink of closure after the eighth negative Education Review Office (ERO) report in eight years. Metro appears to exemplify many neo-liberal principles in education - choice, freedom, lifelong learning, and flexibility - which are considered integral to the "effective school". However its position as a sink (and market safety valve) for unwanted students from other schools, as well as its long history without any official clarification of its status as alternative within the New Zealand education system, positions the school as a danger at the margins of mainstream schooling. Metro's apparent inability to function "properly" within a framework that includes notions of the "good (professional) teacher", the "good (enterprising) student", and the "good (effective) school" is examined against a number of current neo-liberal educational discourses and concepts including teacher professionalism, classroom management, school effectiveness, the exercise of "proper" consumer choice, and the market place of "at risk" students. The thesis re-situates the site of struggles away from the school, teachers, students andfor ERO per se, moving the focus to the narratives of the teachers, students, and ERO. A "post-structural ethnography" is built by combining some aspects of traditional ethnographic methodology with post-structural questions about meaning and historical specificity, moving beyond the ethnographic imperative of getting to the "real story" (Britzman 1995) into a new role of "making the familiar strange rather than the strange familiar" (Van Maanen 1995: 20). In particular Foucault's work on governmental power relations is used as an account of liberalism and neo-liberalism to problematise the current discursive framework in New Zealand education. The framework is explored as a "tricky combination in the same political structures of individualisation techniques and of totalisation procedures" (Foucault 1982: 2 13) and shows how Metro is inevitably a failing school.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/385</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characteristics of Teacher Expertise</field><field name="creator">Davis, Alison</field><field name="description">This study explores characteristics of teacher expertise associated with raising the reading comprehension achievement of year low achieving year 5&#8211;9 students. It reports on the first year of a three year research and development collaboration between researchers and teachers in six different schools situated within a New Zealand Ministry of Education schooling improvement initiative. The project&#8217;s objective has been the deliberate identification of teacher and student needs, the analysis and collaborative use of this information by the researcher and participant teachers to identify characteristics of comprehension teaching that raise student achievement in reading comprehension and identify characteristics of teacher expertise in reading comprehension instruction. In particular, this research is concerned with developing, using and evaluating pedagogical approaches to comprehension strategy instruction in a way that is clearly linked for teachers to the reading comprehension achievement data of the students they teach. The study developed over three phases using action research methodology. At each phase the researcher systematically observed, analysed and enhanced teachers&#8217; expertise and instructional practices associated with improvements in underachieving students&#8217; comprehension. Three sources of data were gathered at each of the three phases to inform the action research. These were data from participating teachers through taped, transcribed and coded interviews, researcher in-class observation (videoed and coded); and student reading comprehension achievement assessment data, gathered through the Supplementary Test of Reading Comprehension &#8211; STAR; (Elley, 2001a, 2001b). Data gathered from the first phase indicated a high proportion of students were underachieving in areas of sentence comprehension, paragraph comprehension and vocabulary. By contrast, teachers believed they were doing a &#8220;good&#8221; job in teaching reading comprehension. Analysis of this mismatch indicated that the following characteristics of teaching and learning in comprehension were not evident: the in-depth analysis and use of student data to inform reading comprehension programs and the successive selection of appropriate teaching approaches, resources and activities; teacher and student analysis and use of formative assessment practices to raise achievement; the importance of taking a strategic approach to comprehension teaching that provided teachers with ways to support and develop both strategic and student centred processing of text, and the critical role of explicit comprehension strategy instruction. This analysis informed the ensuing collaborative approach to professional development in which researchers and teachers jointly developed an ongoing process of analysing and responding to student achievement data to inform instructional strategies, theoretical ideas and practices. The study focused on four main areas of teacher expertise identified through research as critical to raising the reading comprehension achievement of low achieving students. These were teacher knowledge of literacy learning in reading comprehension; teacher knowledge of effective reading comprehension approaches with a specific focus on developing teaching practice specific to low achieving comprehenders; teacher knowledge of analysis and use of student reading comprehension achievement data, and teacher collaboration and problem solving associated with issues of low reading comprehension achievement amongst students in participant teachers&#8217; classrooms. The study concluded that each of these four components were essential characteristics of teacher expertise associated with raising the reading comprehension achievement of low achieving students in years 5-9. As teacher knowledge of literacy learning developed so too did teacher expertise in instructional practice and their ability to analyse areas of student underachievement. The study further found that when ongoing professional learning is evidenced based changes can occur in levels of teacher expertise that result in improved levels of student achievement.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/391</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Experience of Psychosis: Fragmentation, Invalidation and Spirituality</field><field name="creator">Geekie, Jim</field><field name="description">This study is a qualitative investigation into the subjective experience of psychosis as expressed by clients of a first episode psychosis service in psychotherapy sessions. Fifteen participants, already engaged with the author in his clinical role, were recruited for this study. Recordings were made of psychotherapy sessions where participants  subjective experience of psychosis was being discussed as part of the normal course of therapy. Sixty two recordings were made in total, with a mean of 4.1 recordings with each participant. Transcriptions of recordings were made by the author and analysed using Grounded Theory. Commonalities in the data were identified and sorted into categories. Relationships between these categories were explored. Initial analyses yielded 103 distinct categories, which were subsumed under the general headings of Storytelling and Authoring, Causes of Psychosis, Descriptions of Psychotic Experience, Impact of Experience, Responses to and Coping with Experience, Spirituality, and M&#257;ori Issues. Subsequent analysis yielded three theoretical constructs which capture the essence of the subjective experience of psychosis: fragmentation   integration, invalidation  validation, and spirituality. Fragmentation   integration relates a sense of a loosening (or, less often, tightening) of connections and associations between aspects of experience, and applies to the personal and interpersonal domains. Validation   invalidation refers to the sense of having (or not having) confidence in one s ability to accurately perceive or construe experience and to convey this to self and others. Spirituality refers to an inclination to view the experience of psychosis, or aspects of it, in terms of a broad framework of meaning pertaining to how the individual views his or her relationship with the universe. Findings from this research indicate that those who experience psychosis are eager to explore the meanings of their experience and are competent at reflecting on this experience based on their own subjective experience. Important contributions to our understandings of psychosis can be made by those who have such first-hand acquaintance with psychosis. Theoretical, research, clinical and training implications of this research are discussed.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/705</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Petrology of the Cuvier and Paritu Plutons and their metamorphic Aureoles</field><field name="creator">Black, Philippa</field><field name="description">Note 1.

One of these is the study of various life history stages associated with reproduction. Fertilization ecology in broadcast spawning marine organisms, i.e. the process by which sperm and egg fusion occurs once released into the ocean, has been the subject of intensive study for roughly the last 20 years, and represents thus a recent field in ecological sciences. This growth in interest was sparked by studies that showed spawning events may take place predominantly under sperm limiting conditions. More recent findings however, suggest that the occurrence of sperm competition, and the risk of polyspermy (multiple sperm entry in to the egg, which is lethal in echinoderms) can also occur during reproductive events in marine invertebrates. This has also been predicted on theoretical grounds. Even though polyspermy has been observed previously, particularly during aquaculture studies, evidence to assess the occurrence of polyspermy in situ, and the conditions under which it occurs is lacking. Simulated field studies in Evechinus chloroticus as well as laboratory studies in E. chloroticus and Coscinasterias muricata found high levels of polyspermy, even under the sperm limiting conditions that are naturally found in the field in other marine broadcast spawners. Furthermore, laboratory results in both Evechinus and Coscinasterias showed that polyspermy is most likely to increase when sperm concentrations are increased. In addition, even though increasing sperm concentrations increases monospermy to a certain extent, an increase in gamete contact times generates similar levels of monospermy. Results from these studies confirmed the mathematical model predicting some of these events. The timing of gamete release to achieve maximum fertilization success (monospermy) in a broadcast spawner is thought to be under strong selective pressures, because reproductive success is directly related to fitness. The spawning patterns in the sea urchin E. chloroticus observed in this study demonstrated that E. chloroticus spawns under varying environmental and ecological conditions. Interestingly, it appeared that highly synchronous and widespread spawning was found to occur when highly turbulent conditions existed. This may reduce the potential for polyspermy that may exist during mass spawnings under shallow and calm conditions. The demonstration of polyspermy and the confirmation of the mathematical model, suggest that polyspermy is a common and frequent occurrence during broadcast spawning events. Thus polyspermy represents an evolutionary force that may shape the evolution of reproductive phenomena at levels ranging from the gamete to the population.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270700 Ecology and Evolution::270702 Marine and estuarine ecology (incl. marine ichthyology)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/388</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Churchman: a study of James Michael Liston, bishop of Auckland 1920-70</field><field name="creator">Reid, Nicholas Evan</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the life of James Michael Liston (1881-1976), ordained priest 1904, rector of Holy Cross College, Mosgiel 1910-20, Coadjutor-Bishop of Auckland 1920-29, Bishop of Auckland 1929-70, Archbishop from 1954. While Liston was never metropolitan of the Catholic Church in New Zealand, his longevity and the initiatives he took made him for many years the church&#8217;s most visible spokesman. As mentor and teacher of most of the hierarchy, he was widely regarded as the country&#8217;s Catholic &#8220;patriarch&#8221;. The thesis explores Liston&#8217;s personal and cultural inheritance as the New Zealand-born son of expatriate Irish parents. His involvement in Irish-related controversies is examined, including his trial for sedition in 1922. However it is a major contention of this thesis that Liston&#8217;s primary focus was always the welfare of the Catholic Church in New Zealand and in the diocese of Auckland. &#8216;Romanita&#8217; and loyalty to the Vatican were more important than residual Irishness. For each phase of Liston&#8217;s priesthood and episcopate, the thesis examines Liston&#8217;s relationship with diocesan clergy, religious orders, Catholic laity and the general public. Some aspects of Liston&#8217;s behaviour and management style are open to criticism. His rejection by Dunedin clergy (1918-20) and his conflict with Bishop Cleary (1923-29) suggest limitations to his character. His differences with younger clergy in the 1960s suggest that old age affected his judgement. Nevertheless, for most of his career, Liston was an effective and compassionate church leader at a time when the diocese of Auckland became the largest diocese in the country. Necessarily, much detail is given to the administrative processes by which the diocese was developed. James Michael Liston operated on the hierarchical assumptions that were then the episcopal norm. He was essentially a Churchman.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/390</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterising GIGANTEA interactors: the BELL-LIKE HOMEODOMAIN 3 and BELL-LIKE HOMEODOMAIN 10 proteins</field><field name="creator">Milich, Raechel Jean</field><field name="description">ABSTRACT The ability to detect and respond to environmental signals is fundamental in coordinating floral induction in plants to favourable conditions. An important flowering time cue is day length and it is proposed that light signals are perceived and measured by an interaction between photoreceptors and an internal pacemaker, the circadian clock. The control of flowering has been best characterised in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana L. Heynh (Arabidopsis). The GIGANTEA (GI) gene has a complex role in both the promotion of flowering in response to photoperiod and the regulation of the circadian clock. The expression of GI is under circadian control and is affected by day length, light quality and temperature changes. The GI protein is also circadian regulated and is actively degraded in the dark. The biochemical function of GI is unknown and one method to elucidate the role of this protein is to identify protein interactors. The aim of this thesis project was to characterise proteins that interacted with GI. Previously, the BELL-LIKE HOMEODOMAIN 3 (BLH3) protein was identified as a putative GI protein interactor. As part of this thesis work, yeast 2-hybrid and in vitro pull down assays were utilised to confirm the interaction between GI and BLH3. Sequence and phylogenetic analyses were used to further examine the BELL family of proteins. The BELL-LIKE HOMEODOMAIN 10 (BLH10) protein was found to be closely related to BLH3 and also interacted with GI. Reverse 2-hybrid assays were used to determine the regions or domains within the GI, BLH3 and BLH10 proteins required to mediate protein interactions. Expression assays established that the BLH3 and BLH10 transcripts were present throughout plant tissues and times of development. Further analyses revealed that BLH3 and BLH10 are not directly regulated by the circadian clock. The results of GFP expression assays demonstrated that the BLH3 protein is localised to the nucleus in plant cells. Transgenic blh3 and blh10 mutant plants were identified and analysed for flowering and light response phenotypes. BLH3 and BLH10 do not function with GI in the photoperiodic pathway to control flowering, yet the blh3 and blh10 mutants do have a flowering phenotype in short day conditions. Like gi, the blh3 and blh10 mutants exhibited exaggerated hypocotyl elongation in response to red and low light conditions. These results are suggestive of a role for BLH3, BLH10 and GI in flowering and deetiolation responses to specific light conditions in plants.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">flowering, Arabidopsis, protein interaction</field><field name="subject">plant molecular biology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/417</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Molecular Quest for Avirulence Factors in Venturia inaequalis</field><field name="creator">Win, Joe</field><field name="description">The molecular basis for the gene-for-gene relationship of Vm-resistance in apple to Venturia inaequalis was investigated. Incompatible reactions involved a hypersensitive response (HR), which was accompanied by the accumulation of dark brown pigments and autofluorescent materials in epidermal and mesophyll cells at the site of invasion. Cell-free culture filtrates of the avirulent isolate elicited an HR in the Vm host (h5) leaves, but not in the susceptible host (h1). The elicitor activity was resistant to boiling but was abolished by proteinase K digestion. Elicitation of HR was used to monitor purification of the avirulence factor, AVRVm, from liquid cultures of the avirulent isolate following ultrafiltration, acetone precipitation and ion-exchange chromatography. The purest fraction contained three major proteins all with low isoelectric points (pI 3.0-4.5). The fraction also elicited HR on the differential host h4, but not on other resistant hosts (h2, h3 and h6) tested. Three candidate AVRVm proteins were identified and amino acid sequences were obtained using Edman degradation and mass spectrometry. Nucleotide sequences corresponding to these proteins were found in databases of V. inaequalis expressed sequence tags. There were no polymorphisms evident between avirulent and virulent isolates (representing races 1 and 5 respectively) either at genomic DNA or cDNA level of the full open reading frames. RT-PCR revealed that all genes were expressed in both avirulent and virulent isolates during in vitro and in planta growth. All three genes showed similar levels of expression between avirulent and virulent isolates during their in vitro growth. However, preliminary RT-PCR experiments showed that two of these genes were likely to be expressed at lower levels in the virulent compared with the avirulent isolate during compatible infection. Implications of this difference in expression and the future experiments to identify the genuine AvrVm gene were discussed.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Avirulence, Apple Scab, Venturia Inaequalis, Gene-for-Gene</field><field name="subject">Plant Pathology, Molecular Plant-Microbe Interactions</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/397</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Medical decisions at the end of life that hasten death</field><field name="creator">Mitchell, Kay</field><field name="description">Medical decisions at the end of life (MDELs) that have the potential to hasten death are increasingly prevalent in medical practice given (a) an aging population and (b) the increase in medical technology that allows life to be sustained beyond what it could be in the past and sometimes beyond what may be comfortable for the patient. When a decision is made to introduce life-sustaining interventions this may imply a later decision to halt these. Attitudes towards medical decisions that hasten death were explored among Greypower members, 55+ years (N = 595), Psychology students, 29 years and under (N = 205) and General Practitioners, 70 years and under (N = 120) in Auckland, New Zealand. Vignette scenarios were used related to withdrawing and withholding life support and nutrition and hydration, denying dialysis to a requesting patient, increasing medication to address pain at the risk of hastening death, physician supplying information, drugs, physician assisting patient to take drugs and physician giving a lethal injection to a terminally ill patient with intractable pain, on request and physician providing assisted death to a requesting tetraplegic patient. The effect of age of patient and consent on decision-making was also explored. Greypower members and Doctors had similar attitudes towards MDELs that are legal in New Zealand but over three-quarters of the Greypower members judged physician-assisted death for a terminally ill patient as justified compared to only one third of the Doctors. Psychology students were more conservative than either the Greypower members or the Doctors for all judgments related to the justifiability of MDELs. There appear to be underlying philosophical differences in the approaches to end of life decision-making by the three groups with Psychology students favouring a Sanctity of Life position and General Practitioners favouring the Status Quo. Greypower members appear to have a pragmatic approach to end of life care that does not favour one position over another. A second study adapted the questionnaire used in Holland in 1990 by the Remmelink Commission of Inquiry exploring the incidence of MDELs among general practitioners in New Zealand (N = 1255). Results indicate that 63% of general practitioners had made an MDEL for the last patient who died in their practice in the previous twelve months. Practitioners could select more than one action for this patient and taking into account the probability that the end of life would be hastened, 37.2% had withheld treatment, 28.8% had withdrawn treatment and 84.9% had increased medication to relieve pain. Medication to relieve pain or other symptoms was increased in part with the intention of hastening the end of life by 24.8% of practitioners. Actions were taken with the explicit purpose of not prolonging life or hastening the end of life and death was caused by withholding treatment 18.7%, withdrawing treatment 10.2% and prescribing, supplying or administering a drug 5.6%. In 54.8% cases, there was no discussion with the patient prior to the action taken, although in some of these cases a wish had been expressed by the patient at a previous time to have death hastened. Of the 39 cases where a drug was supplied or administered with the explicit intention of hastening death and death occurred, the drug was administered by a nurse alone in 15 cases (under physician orders, implied in the question) and the physician alone in 13 cases. In two cases the patient selfadministered the drug. In order to assess the impact of euthanasia (arguably at the extreme end of the MDEL continuum) on practitioners, a qualitative study was conducted to explore the accounts of ten Dutch doctors who had cared for dying patients, five who had performed euthanasia and five who had not. Themes were compared and contrasted to expose similarities and differences in the approaches of the two groups to patient care. Both groups endorsed palliative care as the preferred approach to the care of the dying patient. Those who had not performed euthanasia expressed their commitment to the patient in continued exploration of palliative options and a stated commitment of non-abandonment of the patient. Those who had performed euthanasia portrayed this action as the &#147;ultimate commitment&#148; to the patient, no other option being seen as meeting patient need. The effect on the doctor of performing euthanasia was intense. Other medical decisions at the end of life that hasten death such as terminal sedation or withdrawing nutrition and hydration were posited by the doctors who had performed euthanasia to be analogous to euthanasia, and the psychological effect on the doctor was similar. Those who had not performed euthanasia stated that these actions were not the same as euthanasia. Dissonance theory was used to explore why the two groups may portray their actions that hasten death in different ways.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/395</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Inter-market linkages : a study of the relationship between the bank bill and the bank bill futures markets in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Poskitt, Russell</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the linkages between the bank bill market and the bank bill futures market in New Zealand using intraday data. The thesis is motivated primarily by the dearth of research on inter-market linkages in interest rate markets using high frequency data. The thesis examines four aspects of the inter-market linkage: (i) the pricing of the bank bill futures contract; (ii) inter-market arbitrage opportunities; (iii) evidence of arbitrage activity, and (iv) inter-market information transmission. The key to the empirical work on these four issues is a model of bill futures pricing developed using the no-arbitrage approach and an intraday data set provided by Reuters and the New Zealand Futures and Options Exchange. The empirical work yields the following findings:  &#8226; the implied forward rate (IFR) model performs well in pricing the bill futures contract. The futures/IFR differential is negligible compared to that documented in many prior studies. The performance of the IFR model is attributed to the fact that it mirrors the favoured quasi-arbitrage strategies of the price-setting interbank dealers.  &#8226; quasi-arbitrage opportunities are infrequent and substantially less profitable than prior studies report. This is also the case when the stringent requirements for conventional arbitrage are relaxed. The frequency and profitability of quasi-arbitrage opportunities are on a par with those reported in the stock index futures and foreign exchange markets.  &#8226; arbitrage opportunities exert only a weak equilibriating influence on the bill futures yield, suggesting that arbitrage activity plays little formal role in price-setting in the bill futures market.  &#8226; information transmission between the bill and bill futures markets is dominated by the contemporaneous flow of information between the two markets and the lagged flow of information from the bill futures market to the bill market. This is consistent with the proposition that bill dealers base their quotes on the bill futures yield curve.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/396</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Facing new challenges: adapting the NZDF and ADF to the post-Cold War security environment</field><field name="creator">Alach, Zhivan</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the development of the Australian and New Zealand Defence Forces during the post-Cold War period. It has been motivated partly by a desire to clear up the confusion that has sometimes developed over recent force structure changes in both countries, as well as a desire to make recommendations for enhanced practise. The thesis combines analysis of both policy process and content, although it is more focused on content. It begins by examining the post-Cold War strategic environment, comparing it to the situation as it was in the Cold War, and identifying what has changed, and the effect of that on the role of militaries around the world. It then focuses more closely on the two countries. It examines their defence policy environments, identifying the various participants in the policy process. It then engages in an analysis of major defence policy reviews of the post-Cold War period, as well as a range of other defence policy occurrences. It identifies the overall impact of those defence policy processes on the force structures of the two defence forces, by identifying elements of continuity and change. The thesis then assesses the capability of the two forces against the requirements of the current strategic environment, and makes recommendations for enhanced practise. Recommendations are focused on both elements of force structure, and the policymaking system itself. The broad conclusion of the thesis is that neither defence force has evolved markedly in the post-Cold War period. Continuity, rather than change, has been the dominant theme. This has been the result of multiple factors, and while many are common between the two countries, others are markedly different. This continuity has not been particularly beneficial in enhancing the effectiveness of the two forces. Change would be useful.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/431</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Identity and socio-historical context : transformations and change among Ma&#772;ori women</field><field name="creator">Houkamau, Carla Anne</field><field name="description">ABSTRACT  Several writers have argued that New Zealand&#8217;s colonial history has thwarted optimal identity development among M&#257;ori (Awatere, 1984; Lawson Te-Aho, 1998a; 1998b). In recent decades the view that M&#257;ori identity may be restored via enculturation has gained widespread acceptance (Broughton, 1993; Edwards, 1999). Recent research indicates, however, that many M&#257;ori perceive their identities in ways that differ from the enculturated ideal (Borrell, 2005; Te Hoe Nuku Roa, 1996; 1999). Relatively little is known of the diverse interpretations that comprise &#8216;alternative&#8217; M&#257;ori identity forms. This thesis aims to contribute to current understandings of M&#257;ori identity by exploring identity change across three generations of M&#257;ori women. For the purposes of the research, identity was treated as &#8216;held&#8217; within personal life-stories and transformations were investigated by comparing the life-stories of 35 M&#257;ori women from different age groups. Attention was given to the impact of three socio-historical processes on identity:  the mass migration of M&#257;ori from rural to urban locations after the 1950s, the drive towards M&#257;ori assimilation which underpinned Government policy towards M&#257;ori until the late 1960s, and the M&#257;ori political and cultural renaissance which gathered momentum in New Zealand from the 1970s. Data analyses found participants born prior to urbanisation evaluated their M&#257;ori identities positively and this seemed to reflect their isolation from P&#257;keh&#257; and exposure to competent M&#257;ori role models during their formative years. Participants aged between 35 and 49 expressed disharmony and tension around their M&#257;ori identities which many attributed to their early exposure to negative evaluations of M&#257;ori people. &#8216;Post-renaissance&#8217; M&#257;ori, aged between 18 and 35, reported prizing their cultural distinctiveness from a young age and affirmed M&#257;ori political, cultural and social equality despite what they perceived as enduring P&#257;keh&#257; prejudice. This interpretation appeared to reflect their early exposure to educational experiences which imparted a sense of cultural pride and a national news media which publicised M&#257;ori political activism. Women&#8217;s life-stories reveal distinct intergenerational differences, a multiplicity of interpretations of M&#257;ori identity not widely articulated in literature, and the need to expand current paradigms of M&#257;ori identity to incorporate the individuality of group members.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420300 Cultural Studies::420306 Maori cultural studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/404</field></doc><doc><field name="title">"Therapy: it's a two-way thing": women survivors of child sexual abuse describe their therapy experiences</field><field name="creator">McGregor, Kim</field><field name="description">This thesis gives a voice to women who have been sexually abused and subsequently received therapy. It contributes to the scarce international literature on evaluations of therapy by women survivors of child sexual abuse (CSA). It is hoped that policies and clinical practices for survivors of CSA will be improved as a result of this research. The study was advertized in the general public to women survivors of CSA who were over the age of 20, who had had at least five therapy sessions but were not currently in therapy. One hundred and ninety-one women completed a postal questionnaire that included open and closed questions about their CSA and disclosure experiences and about what they found helpful and unhelpful in therapy. Twenty respondents took part in follow-up interviews of up to two hours. Themes from the questionnaires and the interviews were analysed using EpiInfo6 and the data management tool NVivo. The majority of participants (91%) experienced CSA to the level of genital contact, or attempted penetration or penetration. Participants took over 16 years on average to disclose the CSA. The majority of participants (86%) reported that, overall, therapy was either somewhat or very helpful. Participants who had over 50 sessions of therapy were significantly more likely to report improved emotional well-being compared with those who had 50 sessions or less. Obstacles to participants gaining sufficient therapy for their needs included the cost of therapy and/or a restricted number of therapy hours subsidized by ACC. Participants reported that helpful therapy included a supportive, interactive therapy relationship with a therapist who was knowledgeable about the dynamics and effects of CSA and of abuse-focused therapy. Acknowledgement, understanding, normalisation and assistance to talk about the CSA and work through the effects on their lives were valued. Unhelpful therapy included a therapy relationship where the therapist was not affectively available or knowledgeable about the dynamics and effects of CSA. Therapists who were unable to support participants to talk about the CSA and work through the effects on their lives were criticized. There were also a few examples of harmful practices. The limitations of the study are the lack of a control group, the fact that participants were self-selected and the retrospective nature of their reports. It was concluded that most therapists were doing an effective job in difficult circumstances. However, some therapists need to develop a more open therapeutic relationship that would allow clients to give feedback about the impact of the therapy.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/408</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cross-cultural communication in a postmodern business environment: the role of French language and culture in New Zealand-French business relations</field><field name="creator">Speedy, Karin Elizabeth</field><field name="description">In international business, notions of homogeneity and standardisation are promoted as necessary parts of the globalisation process. &#8220;One world&#8221; is equated with &#8220;one language&#8221; and English, portrayed as the global lingua franca, is seen as the only language needed to operate successfully in world markets. Using Jean Baudrillard&#8217;s theory of the cyclic superposition of the singular, universal and global as a framework and applying it to the business communications between New Zealand exporters and their French buyers, this thesis questions the beliefs underpinning Anglophone reliance on English, and the value of this reliance, in a postmodern business environment. It first examines historical shifts in attitudes to and use of both dominant &#8220;universal&#8221; languages and individual &#8220;singular&#8221; languages and finds that tensions tend to arise when dominant powers try to impose, in an imperialistic fashion, their language on the &#8220;Other&#8221;. It argues that the universal ideals of unity and openness popularly associated with globalisation are myths expounded by Anglophone big business, which, as the advocate of English as the language of international commerce, fails to recognise the hegemonic implications of its discourse. Through both qualitative and quantitative field research, it reaches the conclusion that, aside from a lack of attention paid to foreign languages in business, international business writers offer outdated and often erroneous cross-cultural advice for doing business in France. This cultural guidance is tainted by both the universalist/structuralist frameworks employed by the writers as well as their own inherent cultural assumptions, and is found to be of little use to New Zealand business people. By reviewing previous research, the thesis determines that New Zealand business has demonstrated a slight shift in attitude toward foreign language use in recent years. The results of my survey, designed to gauge the present attitudes to and use of French among New Zealand exporters, show that while some firms have embraced the idea of using French in business, most are still reliant on English for day-to-day business communications with their French customers. In the view of the latter, however, this behaviour does not foster efficient and equitable business relations. For the French, a New Zealand exporter prepared to use French in the French market would have a competitive advantage. Set in the context of Baudrillard&#8217;s paradigm, the thesis demonstrates that within the New Zealand-French business relationship the perpetual struggle between local and dominant languages continues to be a critical issue that requires urgent redress.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/409</field></doc><doc><field name="title">In-plane Seismic Design of Concrete Masonry Structures</field><field name="creator">Voon, Kok Choon</field><field name="description">The research presented in this thesis consists of two parts. The first part involved the investigation of concrete masonry shear strength and the second part reports an investigation of the lateral strength of partially grout-filled nominally reinforced perforated concrete masonry walls.    Valuable information about masonry shear strength is reported following the testing of ten full scale concrete masonry walls. It was verified that horizontal shear reinforcement and axial compression load provided additional shear resistance to masonry walls. Consequently, the nominal shear strength of reinforced masonry walls could be evaluated as a sum of contributions from masonry, shear reinforcement and applied axial load. It was also established that masonry shear strength decreases inversely in relation to an increase of the wall aspect ratio.    Criteria relating to codification of the in-plane shear strength of concrete masonry walls when subjected to seismic loading are presented. Particular emphasis is placed on a computational model that is capable of representing the interaction between flexural ductility and masonry shear strength to account for the reduction in shear strength as ductility level increases. The simple method proposed here allows the strength enhancement provided by axial compression load to be separated from the masonry component of shear strength and is considered to result from strut action. In addition, minor modifications are made to facilitate adoption of the method in the updated version of the New Zealand masonry design standard, NZS 4230:2004.    Prediction of shear strength from NZS 4230:2004 and using alternative methods are compared with results from a wide range of test of masonry walls failing in shear. It was established that the shear equation in the former version of the New Zealand masonry standard (NZS 4230:1990) was overly conservative in its prediction of masonry shear strength. The current NEHRP shear expression was found to be commendable, but it does not address masonry shear strength within plastic hinge regions, therefore limiting its use when designing masonry structures in seismic regions. Finally, the new shear equation adopted by NZS 4230:2004 was found to provide significantly improved shear strength prediction with respect to its predecessor, with accuracy close to that resulted from NEHRP.    Test results obtained in the second part of this research indicated that the size of openings and the length of trimming reinforcement significantly affected the lateral strength of perforated masonry walls. The observation of diagonal cracking patterns that aligned well with the load paths by which shear force was assumed to be transferred to the foundation in the strut mechanism supported the use of strut-and-tie analysis as a viable tool to evaluate the flexural strength of walls of this type. Strength prediction using the improved strut-and-tie method and the modified plastic collapse analysis were found to closely match the experimental results of the perforated walls tested in this study. Strength prediction by the simplified strut-and-tie method was found to closely match the test results of masonry walls with a single opening, but significant underestimation of strength by this method was found for walls with double openings. Full plastic collapse analysis was found to significantly over-predict the strength of all perforated walls included in this study.    Finally, the NZS 4229:1999 detail for shrinkage control joints was shown to result in adequate structural performance. In addition, shrinkage control joints constructed in accordance with the NZS 4229:1999 prescription resulted in masonry bracing capacity substantially in excess of the tabulated values in the standard, with gradual strength and stiffness degradation.  This increase in strength is due to pier double bending that is not considered by the standard.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/580</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Biochemistry of GIGANTEA: A Circadian Clock-Controlled Regulator of Photoperiodic Flowering in Plants</field><field name="creator">Black, Moyra Maria</field><field name="description">In many organisms, important biological and developmental processes such as growth and reproduction occur in time with particular seasons of the year. Many species recognise seasonal changes through the measurement of changes in day length (photoperiodism) by comparison to an internal oscillator called the circadian clock. Genes involved in photoperiodic processes such as flowering can be studied using the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis). One Arabidopsis gene central to photoperiodism is GIGANTEA (GI). GI mutants show a delay in flowering in inductive day lengths, leading to a longer phase of vegetative growth. Expression of GI is regulated by the circadian clock and is cyclical, peaking in the evening. The GI protein is large, plant-specific, nuclear localised, and has no homology to any other proteins. GI accumulates during the day and drops at night due to predicted proteosomal degradation. While it has been forty years since the first mutant alleles of GI were described much is still unknown about the molecular mechanism of GI action. The objective of this work was to characterise the GI protein, to give a greater understanding of the role of GI in floral induction. Soluble affinity-tagged full-length GI was expressed in Escherichia coli (E. coli) and was stabilised by the addition of the detergent N-dodecyi-&#946;-D-maltoside (DDM) to storage and purification buffers. Stabilised GI was purified using a variety of chromatographic methods, and characterised using a selection of biochemical techniques including circular dichroism, and dynamic light scattering. This showed that purified GI contained secondary structure, but was polydisperse in solution. Limited proteolytic digests and mass spectrometry were used to identify possible GI domains. This led to the identification of a predicted 46 kDa amino terminal GI domain. A variety of potential GI domains were targeted using either a sequence-based bioinformatics approach or an experimentally-derived approach, and were expressed in E.coli. While most of these domains remained intractably insoluble, the 46 kDa amino-terminal domain showed partial solubility when expressed at 10&#176;C and lysed in buffer containing DDM. This domain was expressed from two plant species (Arabidopsis and Rye Grass) and large-scale expression and purification protocols developed. In vivo characterisation of the amino terminal GI domain in Arabidopsis plants suggested that while the protein product of the domain may be unstable, a region of the domain could have a dominant negative effect on flowering time in wild type plants. Arabidopsis plants were also used to characterise the light responses of full-length GI protein. This showed that GI protein accumulated to high levels in plants exposed to blue, white and red light, with blue-light plants showing the highest levels of GI accumulation. GI protein was then shown to accumulate less in plants lacking the CRY1 and CRY2 blue light photoreceptors than plants with functional CRY1 and CRY2 genes.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/414</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Drawing the line: a working epistemology for the study of architectural drawing</field><field name="creator">Wood, Peter</field><field name="description">The conventional view of architectural drawing presents it as a paradigm for architectural knowledge based on a visual relationship between an idea and a built work where the drawing operates as a neutral and passive vehicle for the transformation of architectural thought into architectural practice. In this model the drawing is merely a utilitarian convenience for the passage of the architect&#8217;s imaginings. Coded into this relationship is the accepted authority of our visual faculties to mediate and interpret the communicative aspects of drawing. This work questions the hegemonic role of vision in the execution and interpretation of architectural drawings, and proposes instead a more complex and discursive model for the transmission of architectural knowledge through a drawn medium. With reference to three case study drawings circa 1980 (Aldo Rossi: Interno con il del mondo, 1981; Morphosis: Venice III, 1982; Peter Eisenman: House X, 1976) this period is identified as the end of a tradition of manual drawing for architects, that has historically defined the practice of contemporary architecture. It is argued that architects have depended upon a visual paradigm for the operation of drawing to organize their relationship to architecture, and that this has in turn prohibited comprehensive analytical critique of the drawing and its place in wider architectural production. Each case study offers a point of departure for a critical reappraisal of the role played by drawing in the relationships that exist between the idea and the work in architecture. In particular the function of touch is proposed as a counter sensory knowledge that is coded into architectural drawing, but whose presence is then repressed as unconstitutional to the idea/project relationship. In making this argument a series of figures are introduced (consisting principally of the hieroglyph, the hand and touch, and blindness) to produce an epistemological framework for further discussion on the subject. It is suggested in conclusion that although the development of digital technologies has shifted architectural representation away from traditional manual practices that this should not be viewed as a representational paradigm shift since the ideological framework that organizes our relationship to the screen is the same one that has existed with the page, and perpetuates the same ideological problems.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/426</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modelling Breast Tissue Mechanics Under Gravity Loading</field><field name="creator">Rajagopal, Vijayaraghavan</field><field name="description">This thesis presents research that was conducted to develop anatomically realistic finite element models of breast deformation under a variety of gravity loading conditions to assist clinicians in tracking suspicious tissues across multiple imaging modalities. Firstly, the accuracy of the modelling framework in predicting deformations of a homogeneous body was measured using custom designed silicon gel phantoms. The model predicted surface deformations with an average RMS error of 1.5 mm +/- 0.2 mm and tracked internal marker locations with an average RMS error of 1.4 mm +/- 0.7 mm.  A novel method was then developed to determine the reference configuration of a body, when given its mechanical properties, boundary conditions and a deformed configuration. The theoretical validity of the technique was confirmed with an analytic solution. The accuracy of the method was also measured using silicon gel experiments, predicting the reference configuration surface with an average RMS error of 1.3 mm +/- 0.1 mm, and tracking internal marker locations with an average error of 1.5 mm +/- 0.8 mm.  Silicon gel composites were then created to measure the accuracy of standard techniques to model heterogeneity. The models did not match the experimentally recorded deformations. This highlighted the need for further validation exercises on modelling heterogeneity before modelling them in the breast. A semi-automated algorithm was developed to fit finite element models to the skin and muscle surfaces of each individual, which were segmented from breast MR images. The code represented the skin with an average RMS error of 1.46 mm +/- 0.32 mm and the muscle with an average RMS error of 1.52 mm +/- 0.3 mm.  The framework was then tested using images of the breast obtained under different gravity loading conditions and neutral buoyancy. A homogeneous model was first developed using the neutral buoyancy images as a representation of the reference configuration. The model did not accurately capture the regional deformations of the breast under gravity loading. However, the gross shape of the breast was reproduced, indicating that a biomechanical model of the breast could be useful to reliably track tissues across multiple images for cancer diagnosis.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">breast</field><field name="subject">finite element modelling</field><field name="subject">soft tissue mechanics</field><field name="subject">biomechanics</field><field name="subject">image registration</field><field name="subject">finite elasticity</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/704</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Raman scattering in optical fibres</field><field name="creator">Wardle, David</field><field name="description">The Raman effect is the inelastic scattering of photons by matter. When a monochromatic light beam (pump beam) propagates in an optical fibre, spon- taneous Raman scattering transfers some of the photons to new frequencies. The probability of a photon scattering to a particular frequency shift, depends on that frequency shift, forming a characteristic spectrum. The scattered photons may lose energy (Stokes) or gain energy (anti-Stokes). If the pump beam is linearly polarized, then the polarization of scattered photons may be the same (parallel scattering) or orthogonal (perpendicular scattering). If photons are already present at other frequencies then the probability of scattering to those frequencies is enhanced (stimulated scattering). In this thesis, the equations governing the Raman effect, both in bulk glass and single mode fibre, are restated. The probability of spontaneous scattering (parallel and perpendicular) in an optical fibre has been measured for frequency shifts between 4THz and 58THz. Particular attention has been given to those frequency shifts where the scattering is intrinsically weak. This has identified those frequency shifts where it might be possible to eliminate Raman noise from experiments designed to generate quantum states of light in optical fibres using four wave mixing. From the measured scattering probabilities, the Raman equations can be used to predict the scattering cross-section in bulk glass. The prediction is found to be in reasonable agreement with measurements of the bulk glass cross-section published by other authors. By increasing the pump power, the transition to stimulated scattering has been observed. In the case of Stokes scattering there is reasonable agreement between the Raman equations and experimental observations. In the case of anti-Stokes scattering, and in the limit of very high pump power, behaviour is observed which is not predicted by the Raman equations, indicating that other processes must be included to successfully describe such experiments.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/433</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effect of two cognitive-behavioural interventions on patient adherence to physiotherapy rehabilitation</field><field name="creator">Bassett, Sandra Frances</field><field name="description">The research in this thesis used prospective randomised controlled trials to evaluate two cognitive-behavioural interventions designed to improve adherence to physiotherapy in patients with ankle sprains. In Study 1, a DVD and written intervention grounded in Protection Motivation Theory (PMT: Rogers, 1983) and assessment tools were developed and piloted. In the pilot 31 patients were randomized into one of three treatment conditions (PMT, attention control and non-contact control). Following the intervention patients beliefs toward physiotherapy and injury were assessed. Compared to the two controls, the PMT group had significantly higher scores on severity, vulnerability and response efficacy. No differences were found for self-efficacy or intentions. Both response efficacy and self efficacy were significantly related to intentions. Based on these findings, the self-efficacy component of the PMT DVD was revised. Study 2 (n = 71), an identical three group design, tested the PMT-based intervention&#8217;s effect on beliefs, intentions, adherence and functional outcomes. Before physiotherapy, antecedents to adherence (motivation, pain, and subjective norm) and functional outcomes were measured, then the intervention was given, and beliefs and intentions evaluated. Adherence to clinic and home physiotherapy was assessed throughout the treatment programme and functional outcomes again at the end of treatment. Compared to the two controls, the intervention group was significantly higher on all PMT beliefs barring self-efficacy. No significant group differences were found for intentions, adherence and post-physiotherapy functional outcomes. Significant relations occurred between the antecedents, PMT beliefs, intentions, adherence and functional outcomes. The lack of group differences on intention, adherence and functional outcome was attributed to most participants having previously had physiotherapy and antecedent scores that typify highly adherent patients. Study 3 (n = 47) compared a home-based programme steeped in adherence enhancing strategies with its traditional clinic counterpart. Psychological variables (antecedents, locus of control, and anxiety) and functional outcomes were measured before and after the course of physiotherapy, and adherence during. No group differences occurred on either the psychological or functional outcome variables. Compared to the clinic group, the home-based participants required significantly less clinic appointments, had a higher percentage of attendance and a significantly better completion rate. No group differences existed for their adherence to the physiotherapy. Significant relations occurred between psychological variables, adherence, and functional outcomes. Findings suggest home-based physiotherapy is a viable, safe treatment option.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/439</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Three-dimensional mapping of electrical propagation in the heart: experimental and mathematical model based analysis</field><field name="creator">Hooks, Darren Anthony</field><field name="description">In this thesis, mathematical modelling, instrumentation development and experimental studies are combined to effect two advances in the study of cardiac electrophysiology. Firstly, we outline a method that will enable microstructural information gathered using extended confocal microscopy to be incorporated into whole heart models of electrical propagation. A structured finite element technique is used to solve the bidomain equations on a realistic representation of myocardial architecture. The effects of intercellular gaps in the tissue on electrical propagation, and the response of myocardium to defibrillation-strength shocks, are examined. It is shown that myocardium is not a transversely isotropic electrical medium as has been widely assumed. Instead it is most appropriately viewed as orthotropic, with different electrical properties assigned to three microstructurally defined orthogonal axes. It is also concluded that the intercellular tissue gaps provide a likely mechanism for activation of a critical volume of tissue during defibrillation. Secondly, a novel imaging system is presented which enables transmembrane potentials to be recorded simultaneously at multiple sites through the heart wall. While heart surface optical recordings of transmembrane potential have been widely used in studies of normal and pathological heart rhythms, it is difficult to obtain information about propagation processes deep within the heart wall. A probe constructed from optical fibers is used to deliver excitation light to and collect fluorescence from 6 tissue sites each spaced 1mm apart. For individual channels, excitation is provided by the 488nm line of a watercooled argon-ion laser, while the fluorescence of a voltage-sensitive dye is split at 600nm and imaged into separate photodiodes for later signal ratioing. The system has been sucessfully used to record intramural action potentials in the isolated rabbit heart and is designed to be easily expandable to accommodate multiple optical probes. The fluorescence collection volume of the fibre-optic probe has been characterised in rhodamine solution using two-photon microscopy. These data are compared with corresponding results obtained with two flat cleaved optical fibres in solution and in stained heart tissue. The results demonstrate that the effective collection depth in cardiac tissue for our optrodes was 100&#956;m, but that this is dependent on the type of optical fibre used to fabricate the optrode. These techniques developed in this research provide a basis for more systematic study of the initiation and termination of reentrant electrical activity in the heart. Future research that builds on the original findings presented in this thesis is discussed.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/440</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Prenatal and postnatal nutritional influences on leptin sensitivity and susceptibility to diet-induced obesity in the rat</field><field name="creator">Krechowec, Stefan Ostap</field><field name="description">The developmental origins of health and disease hypothesis suggests that exposure to adverse prenatal environmental influences can determine an individual&#8217;s susceptibility to obesity in adult life. However, the specific causal mechanisms which underlie this hypothesis have yet to be identified. Focusing on the potential mechanistic role of the leptin endocrine axis, the main objective of this thesis was to investigate the long term effects of prenatal undernutrition and different levels of postnatal nutrition on leptin sensitivity and the development of diet-induced obesity (DIO) in the Wistar rat. A well established animal model of maternal undernutrition during pregnancy was used to induce prenatal undernutrition in experimental offspring. To investigate the interaction between prenatal nutrition and postnatal diet, and its effects on obesity development, female offspring were placed on three different diets: standard chow, a high fat diet or a calorie restricted diet. The effects of prenatal undernutrition and postnatal diet on leptin sensitivity were investigated, in adult offspring, by measuring the response to 14 days of peripheral leptin treatment. Changes in gene expression in the liver, retroperitoneal adipose tissue and soleus muscle were then characterised by custom microarray and quantitative real-time RT-PCR (QPCR) analysis.  Adult female offspring exposed to prenatal undernutrition (UN offspring) were found to exhibit leptin resistance in adulthood, independent of postnatal DIO. This result demonstrates for the first time that exposure to prenatal undernutrition has a long term effect on adult leptin sensitivity. In UN offspring fed on a high-fat diet, leptin resistance significantly accelerated the development of DIO while in contrast, offspring maintained on calorie restriction remained lean. These findings suggest that prenatal nutrition can shape future susceptibility to DIO by altering postnatal leptin sensitivity. An analysis of gene expression suggests that prenatal undernutrition causes the development of peripheral tissue-specific leptin resistance, and may also further enhance an offspring&#8217;s susceptibility to DIO by altering the regulation of peripheral tissue lipogenesis, mitochondrial function, glucocorticoid metabolism and insulin sensitivity.  In conclusion, these studies identify peripheral leptin resistance as a key mechanism that can influence postnatal susceptibility to DIO in female offspring exposed to prenatal undernutrition. Furthermore, the identification of specific changes in peripheral gene expression highlights four additional metabolic mechanisms which may also facilitate the development of DIO in leptin resistant UN offspring.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fetal programming</field><field name="subject">Obesity</field><field name="subject">Leptin</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321000 Clinical Sciences::321019 Paediatrics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/701</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Minors and planar embeddings of digraphs</field><field name="creator">Sneddon, Jamie David</field><field name="description">Embedding graphs in surfaces is the central concept of topological graph theory. Classifying embeddability of graphs is motivated by Kuratowski&#8217;s Theorem and Robertson-Seymour theory, which confirms that the set of obstructions to embeddability in an arbitrary surface is finite. We consider embedding directed graphs in surfaces, with restrictions on the direction of arcs in the local rotation at each vertex. Clustered planar digraphs have planar embeddings in which, at each vertex, all of the in-arcs occur sequentially in the local rotation. Three different variations of minors are presented, each of which produces a finite set of obstructions to clustered planarity. These variations include new operations on digraphs, and measures which refine the partial ordering. Tournaments are digraphs with exactly one edge between every distinct pair of vertices. The domination graph of a tournament is a graph with the same vertices, and an edge between two of the vertices if every other vertex is beaten by one of those two vertices. We present two variations of domination graphs, and investigate the relationships between them and their limitations. We investigate those graphs which may be domination graphs of tournaments using excluded minors. Such graphs have a finite set of obstructions under a modification of the minor partial order.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/441</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ethical pesticide policy : beyond risk assessment</field><field name="creator">Watts, Meriel Ann</field><field name="description">This thesis sets out to develop a pesticide policy process that is ethical, one that fairly addresses the needs of society whilst at the same time minimizing the impact of pesticides on nature. The process that is developed here is context dependent: it is not a prescription for all public policy processes, but one specifically for pesticides in one country at a particular period in time. Nevertheless, the general principles are widely applicable to other areas of policy, particularly those involving technological risks, and to other countries. Much of the material used is drawn from the New Zealand experience, with two major exceptions: United States data is used to describe the toxicological risk assessment process and its failures, and studies conducted in Asia are used to illustrate community participatory research. The development of Auckland City's Weed Management Policy is used to illustrate the potential of the proposed approach to pesticide policy. It is argued that the reductionist science of toxicology, on which current pesticide policy heavily depends, fails to accurately predict the effects of pesticides on human health and on the environment. It is shown to be based on a particular set of values that cannot be said to represent those of society in general. These two factors contribute significantly to the differences in the acceptability of risks from pesticides by lay people and by technical experts. There are also gender and race differences in assessment of risk. It is argued that to base pesticide policy on toxicology is irrational because this science fails to incorporate ecological rationality, i.e. the interconnectedness of nature, and social rationality. It is also argued that pesticide policy based on the anthropocentric approach of the domination of nature, which broadly underlies the mechanistic worldview of science, is unethical because it fails to take into account the needs and interests of nonhuman nature. Ethical pesticide policy is therefore based on ecological rationality ( as well as social rationality) and a recognition of the intrinsic interests of nature, both aspects of an ecocentric ethic. The ecocentric ethic is practically applied to pesticide policy processes by using the decision rule of the principle of minimum harm, which is an expression of the precautionary approach. The objectivity and cultural authority of science are challenged and the way is cleared for the introduction of other knowledge into the ethical pesticide policy process. It is scientism, not science that is rejected, and science takes its place alongside other knowledge systems. Wisdom is incorporated into the policy process by including the knowledge of members of the community and of public interest groups who have understanding and experience of the effects of pesticides, and also the management of pest, weeds and disease in agri-ecosystems in ways that minimize harm to nonhuman nature, principally by the methods of organic agriculture and natural farming. Democracy is improved by including in the decision-making those who lie in the path of the policy: public interest groups that bring expertise, experience, and social values, farming interest groups that bring the views of those who use pesticides and those who manage the agri-ecosystem without them, and the appropriate bureaucrats. The pesticide industry is not included in the decision-making group for ethical reasons. The tripartite approach is augmented by a person representing the interests of nonhuman nature, an ecocentrist whose role it is to ensure that the principle of minimum harm is adequately applied. This is an acknowledgement of the need for considerable attitudinal change, particularly on the part of bureaucrats and pesticide users, in order that the ethical pesticide policy process lives up to its potential. Distributional justice issues are addressed by requiring that the policy decision-making group consists of 50 percent women/50 percent men, and 50 percent pakeha/50 percent Maori, to reflect firstly the gender differences in the acceptability of risks from pesticides, and secondly the bicultural nature of New Zealand as afforded by the nation's founding legal document, the Treaty of Waitangi.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/442</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Metabolism and physiology during ontogeny of cultured yellowtail kingfish (Seriola Ialandi Carangidae)</field><field name="creator">Moran, Damian</field><field name="description">Various aspects of metabolism and physiology were investigated during the ontogeny of yellowtail kingfish (Seriola lalandi), a fish of growing aquaculture importance in both New Zealand and other countries. Incubation experiments between 18-24&#176;C showed that developing eggs and larvae were heavily influenced by temperature. It appeared that at warmer temperatures larvae hatched smaller but grew on the yolk sac, whereas at cooler temperatures larvae grew inside the chorion. Oxygen consumption data supported this, with a negative correlation found between total embryonic oxygen consumption and temperature. A mechanism was proposed to explain the differential effect of temperature on ontogeny and growth. Like other marine fish with pelagic eggs, yellowtail kingfish were found to be heavily reliant on free amino acids as a source of energy. At 23&#176;C the pattern of substrate utilisation in eggs was considerably different from that at 17-21&#176;C, indicating that 23&#176;C exceeded the tolerance for normal development. Inter-individual aggression by large individuals was associated with the development of size heterogeneity in juveniles. Although this aggression also affected the survival of smaller juveniles, it was not the primary agent of much of the mortality that occurs during this phase, as many of these individuals were on a degenerate developmental trajectory. Yellowtail kingfish fingerlings used for ongrowing were robust to the stressors imposed by live transport. The ontogenetic development of metabolic rate from 0.6 mg-2.2 kg did not follow the same scaling exponent as that observed for mammalian models of allometry, and has implications for interspecific studies of mass-dependent metabolism.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270700 Ecology and Evolution::270702 Marine and estuarine ecology (incl. marine ichthyology)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/443</field></doc><doc><field name="title">International Labour Standards. The formation and development of an international regime. New Zealand and the International Labour Organisation 1919-1945</field><field name="creator">Hughes, Stephen</field><field name="description">The purpose of this thesis is to examine the development of the international labour standards regime and the role of New Zealand in the development of this regime. To achieve this aim, it first sets out to determine what we mean by a regime, second it examines the development of relations between the International Labour Organisation (ILO) and New Zealand in the context of regime development from 1919 to 1945. The substantive analysis is confined to the period from the end of the First World War to the end of the Second World War. This is done for the following reasons. First, the period saw the introduction of an international labour standards regime and constituted a critical period in regime formation and development. Second, it marks a period when New Zealand developed from a reluctant and passive regime member to a proactive advocate of the principles and norms of regime compliance. Third, the international order that prevailed from 1945 onward is of such significant difference from that which prevailed during the inter-war period that it merits a sustained examination in its own right and as such remains outside the scope of this thesis. This thesis demonstrates that three substantive policies &#8211; a policy of autonomy; a policy of presence; and a policy of relevance &#8211; cultivated and employed by the ILO made a significant contribution towards the development and consolidation of the international labour standards regime. In the context of these three policies it explores the role of New Zealand&#8217;s in the process. In particular, it identifies and examines linkages between domestic and international interests and their influence on regime development. Furthermore it shows how and why the international labour standards regime distanced itself from the League of Nations. This thesis seeks to achieve these aims for three reasons. First, no previous work has attempted to conduct a detailed examination of relations between the ILO and New Zealand. Second, no previous work has examined the formation and development of the international labour standards regime from the perspective of international organisation/state relations. Third, it seeks to contribute to a research programme that views international co-operation as not only a product of inter-state relations but of the interaction between domestic and international interests. - FROM INTRODUCTION</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/456</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Problems in Tongan Lexicography</field><field name="creator">Taumoefolau, Melenaite L.</field><field name="description">This thesis is an attempt to address the major theoretical and practical problems in compiling a monolingual Tongan dictionary. The first question that is asked is: what can be learned from the lexicographical experiences of Pacific languages to date? Since the Pacific islands share a common history with regard to European contact, and since many Pacific languages are characterised by the same basic principles, many languages being of the same language family, Austronesian, it is expected that important issues pertaining to lexicography in a language like Tongan would be similar to those in related Pacific languages, and much will be learned from the experiences and achievements in lexicography of other Pacific languages. For this reason, chapter 1 looks at a brief history of lexicography in the Pacific islands, and chapter 2 reviews selected Pacific dictionaries with a view to identifying their merits and demerits. Chapter 3 then identifies the main functions envisaged for the monolingual Tongan dictionary in developing the Tongan language. These functions are responses to language needs that arise out of the sociolinguistic situation. Chapters 4 - 7 examine various aspects of the language that are relevant to dictionary making and try to determine appropriate ways of describing the language in the dictionary. Chapter 4 gives a description of the main aspects of the Tongan phonological system and suggests ways of improving the present orthography for use in the dictionary. Chapter 5 looks at Tongan morphology and suggests, with reference to the sociolinguistic process of conventionalisation, an answer to the question: what is a lexical item in Tongan? The principles governing the selection of lexical items for inclusion in the dictionary are given here. Chapter 6 looks at major aspects of Tongan syntax, namely parts of speech, transitivity, and possession, with a view to determining how they are to be used in dictionary entries. Chapter 7 looks at the way meaning and usage are to be represented in the dictionary. Chapter 8 addresses the question of organization and presentation of material in the dictionary. Principles of ordering headwords, homonyms, the senses of headwords, and the elements of an entry are discussed. Chapter 9 consists of sample entries for different word categories in Tongan. The entries, which are translated into English for assessment purposes, show the recommended ways of presenting different word types in Tongan.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420300 Cultural Studies::420307 Pacific cultural studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/475</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Computational Model of the Ocular Lens</field><field name="creator">Malcolm, Duane Tearaitoa Kingwell</field><field name="description">The aim of this project is to develop a computational model of the structure and function of the ocular lens, specifically the solute and fluid transport in the lens.  The modelling framework was based on finite volume methods. The intracellular and extracellular solute fluxes were modelled using the Nernst-Plank equation with an extra term to capture solute fluxes due to advection. The modelling framework included equations describing the flux through the Na+ /K+ pumps and K+ channels in the surface membrane, and Na+ and Cl- channels in the fibre cell membrane. The intracellular fluid flow between adjacent fibre cells was modelled by a homogenised transmembrane fluid flow equation and the intracellular fluid flow along the fibre cell was modelled as Poiseuille flow. The extracellular fluid flow was modelled as Couette flow with an extra term to capture electro-osmotic flow. The fluid flow through the fibre cell membrane and surface membrane was modelled as transmembrane fluid flow. The governing equations account for the structural properties of the lens, such as the tortuosity of the extracellular cleft, the intracellular and extracellular volume fractions, and the membrane density.  A one-dimensional model of the Na+ , K+ , Cl- and fluid transport in the frog lens was developed. This model was based on the analytic model developed by Mathias (1985b). The results were consistent with the results from the analytic model and experimental data.  Two versions of the two-dimensional model were developed. In the first model, the parameters were spatially constant except for the distribution of the Na+ /K+ pump currents at the lens surface and the fibre cell angles. The second model was the same, except the extracellular cleft width and fibre cell height was spatially varied to represent the sutures and the diffusion barrier. These models were solved and compared with each other and with experimental data.  Compared to the first, the second model predicted a significantly larger circulation of solutes and fluid between the pole and equator. It predicted a 12-20% increase in the penetration of Na+ , K+ and fluid into the lens. The second model also predicted a 300-400% increase in Cl- penetration and, unlike the first model, a Cl- circulation between the poles and equator. This is significant since Cl- is not an actively transported solute. These results highlight the strong structure-function relationship in the lens and the importance of an accurate spatial representation of model parameters.  The direction of the current, solute fluxes and fluid flow that were predicted by the model were consistent with experimental data but the magnitude of the surface current was a tenth to a third of the values measure by the vibrating probe.  To demonstrate the application of the lens model, the two-dimensional model was used to simulate age-related changes in lens physiology. This was done by increasing the radius of the lens to simulate growth with age. The model predicted an increase in the intracellular Na+ concentration, Cl- concentration and potential, and a decrease in the intracellular K+ concentration with age. These trends were consistent with those observed by Duncan et al. (1989), except for the intracellular K+ concentration, where they reported no change with age.  The two-dimensional model forms a foundation for future developments and applications.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">bioengineering</field><field name="subject">model</field><field name="subject">finite volume methods</field><field name="subject">ocular lens</field><field name="subject">eye</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/754</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Coherence in Atom and Quantum Optics</field><field name="creator">Wong, Tony</field><field name="description">This thesis is the result of three years research in the Physics department at the University of Auckland. This research can be roughly divided into three projects. In the first year, Professor Dan Walls brought to my attention an experiment performed by Eichmann and co-workers. They observed interference of resonance fluorescence from two trapped ions using a polarization-sensitive detection scheme. We applied traditional quantum optics methods to analyze this experiment. A numerical technique, the Monte Carlo wave function method was used to simulate the classical motion of the ions and various orientations of the incident light. The results of Eichmann's experiment has been claimed by Scully and co-workers to support their view that only complementarity is required to explain the loss of interference in which-way schemes. However, our analysis shows to the contrary that Eichmann's experiment cannot be regarded as a which-way experiment and its results can be understood without resorting to these which-way arguments. The experimental Bose-Einstein condensation of dilute gases and the avalanche of theoretical work that followed it provoked our second project. Following a simplistic model of interference between two bose-condensates suggested by Javanainen we explore the establishment of the relative phase. We extend his work by including the effect of collisions (atom-atom interactions). Although we treat the condensate with a single mode model so that the formulation looks similar to quantum optics, these condensates consist of atoms and the resultant atom-atom interactions introduces an additional complexity; that of non-linear effects. Viewpoints must also be altered, absolute phase in a matter wave such as a bose-condensate is unphysical thus motivating an analysis of relative phases between two condensates. This project lasted for about one and a half years with injections of fresh input from several collaborators. Firstly, Professor Ewan Wright became involved in the collapse and revivals of the phase. His work on the collapse using a multi-mode single condensate was connected with our single-mode two condensate material. Secondly, during Professor Robert Graham's short stay at the University of Auckland, he performed analytic calculations of the establishment of the relative phase for the cases of thermal or Poissonian initial states. This work fitted nicely with our numerical efforts in this regime where our knowledge of the initial atom number is uncertain. Finally, Dr Karl Vogel and Bernhard Kneer, a Ph.D. student studying under Professor Wolfgang Schleich, started the third project with their atom laser proposal. The dynamics of a condensate confined in a trap was modelled by using a modified, Gross-Pitaevski equation that included both a pump and a loss term. This represents an atom laser since the confined condensate can be regarded as a "laser mode". My input into this model has been concentrated upon a spatially dependent loss. This has allowed us to study the influence of the pump and the spatially dependent loss on the shape and phase of the confined condensate in the steady-state regime.

The description of the variability in life history characteristics among populations of the Chilean oyster is fundamental to understanding its biology and may help in solving some of the problems encountered in culturing this species. Research presented in this thesis describes some aspects of the reproductive biology of the Chilean oyster from four populations, mainly in northern New Zealand, and compares the results with previous studies from elsewhere. Similar patterns of gametogenesis were found among three study populations at Manukau Harbour, Hauraki Gulf and Foveaux Strait. Oysters were protandrous, maturing firstly as males and later also producing ova. In all three populations the majority of the contents of all the gonads were male reproductive products. There was no evidence that the sexuality of oysters alternated rhythmically as has been reported in other species of larviparous oysters. For spawning females, the often concurrent release of ripe sperm indicated the possible presence of self fertilisation. In samples of oysters examined from Foveaux strait the sexuality of oysters was found to change markedly with size. This suggested that the infection of oysters by the parasite Bonamia may not be related to their sexuality as was previously thought. At two northern populations (Hauraki Gulf and Manukau Harbour) larvae were produced from young, small oysters, and a much larger proportion of the population was brooding larvae each year than has been reported elsewhere. In both populations, larvae were being brooded, released and were settling at all times of the year, unlike other populations. The mean fertility of the Manukau Harbour oysters was the highest so far reported for any population of this species. The size of larvae in all three northern populations were smaller than has been reported for all other locations in New Zealand and chile and is thought to be related to differences in water temperatures. Overall, the results highlight the importance of investigations into populations of molluscs across their geographical range for revealing variation in life history characteristics which may be of benefit for aquaculture.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270700 Ecology and Evolution::270702 Marine and estuarine ecology (incl. marine ichthyology)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/489</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Designing an application-specific programming language for mobile robots</field><field name="creator">Biggs, Geoffrey</field><field name="description">The process of programming mobile robots is improved by this work. The tools used for programming robot systems have not advanced significantly, while robots themselves are rapidly becoming more capable because of advances in computing power and sensor technology. Industrial robotics relies on simple programming tools usable by non-expert programmers, while robotics researchers tend to use general purpose languages designed for programming in other domains.  The task of developing a robot cannot be assumed to be identical to developing other software-based systems. The nature of robot programming is that there are different and additional challenges when programming a robot than when programming in other domains. A robot has many complex interfaces, must deal with regular and irregular events, real-time issues, large quantities of data, and the dangers of unknown conditions. Mobile robots move around and are capable of affecting everything in the environment. They are found in cluttered environments, rather than the carefully-controlled work spaces of industrial robots, increasing the risk to life and property and the complexity of the software.  An analysis of the process of developing robots provides insight into how robot programming environments can be improved to make the task of robot development easier. Three analyses have been performed: a task analysis, to determine the important components of the robot development process, a use case analysis, to determine what robot developers must do, and a requirements analysis, to determine the requirements of a robot programming environment. From these analyses, the important features of a robot development environment were found. They include features such as data types for data commonly found in robotics, semantics for managing reactivity, and debugging facilities such as simulators.  The analyses also found that the language is an important component of the programming environment. An application-specific language designed for robot programming is proposed as a solution for providing this component. Application-specific languages are designed for a particular domain of programming, allowing them to overcome the difficulties in that domain without concern for their usefulness in other domains. To test the hypothesis that such a language would improve robot development a set of language extensions has been created. These extensions, named RADAR, provide explicit support for robotics. The prototype implementation uses the Python programming language as the base language.  RADAR provides support for two of the necessary features found in the analyses. The first is support for dimensioned data via a new primitive data type, ensuring all dimensioned data is consistent throughout a program. Dimensional analysis support is provided, allowing the safe mixing of data with compatible units, the creation of more complex units from simple single-dimension units, and built-in checking for errors in dimensioned data such as performing operations involving incompatible dimensioned data. For example, the data type will prevent the addition of distance and speed values. Several dimensional analysis systems have been developed for general purpose languages in the past. However, this is the first application of the concept specifically to robotics.  The second feature is semantics for managing reactivity. In RADAR, the principle of ease-of-use through simplicity is followed. Special objects represent events and responses, and a special syntax is used for both specifying these objects and managing the connections between them in response to the changing state of the program. This reduces programming complexity and time. There are many other languages for managing reactivity, both the more general languages, such as Esterel, and languages for robotics, such as TDL and Colbert. RADAR is simpler than the general languages, as it is aimed solely at the needs of robot developers. However, it takes a different approach to its design than other languages for reactivity in robotics. These are designed to provide support for a specific architecture or architecture style; RADAR is designed based on the needs of robot developers and so is architecture-independent.  RADAR&#8217;s design philosophy is to provide robot-specific features with simple semantics. RADAR is designed to support what robot developers need to do with the language, rather than providing a special syntax for supporting a particular robot, architecture or other system. RADAR has been shown to provide an improvement in dimensioned data management and reactivity management for mobile robot programming. It increases the readability, writability and reliability of robot software, and can reduce programming and maintenance costs. RADAR shows that an application-specific approach to developing a robot programming language can improve the process of robot development.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">robots</field><field name="subject">programming</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/702</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mapping a new future: Primary Health Care Nursing in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Sheridan, Nicolette Fay</field><field name="description">The aim of the study was to determine the practice of nurses employed in integrated care projects in New Zealand from late 1999 to early 2001. Integrated care was a major health reform strategy that emphasised primary health care as a means to improve service provision between the health sectors. An investigation of nurses&#8217; practice sought to determine the extent to which primary health care principles had been adopted in practice, as a comprehensive primary health care approach has been advocated globally in the management of chronic conditions; the leading cause of disability throughout the world and the most expensive problems faced by health care systems. The philosophical basis of the research was postpositivism. The study employed a quantitative non-experimental survey design because it allowed numeric descriptions of the characteristics of integrated care projects to be gained for the purpose of identifying nurses&#8217; practice. The unit of inquiry was the integrated care project, and 80 comprised the study population. Data were obtained on projects from expert informants (n=27) by telephone survey using a structured interview questionnaire developed by the researcher. Data obtained from interviews were statistically analysed in two stages. First, data were produced to comprehensively describe the characteristics of integrated care projects and nurses practice. The &#8216;Public health interventions model&#8217; was used as a framework to analyses the interventions (activities) and levels of population-based practice of nurses. Following this, the social values embedded in nurses&#8217; practice were determined using &#8216;Beattie&#8217;s model of health promotion&#8217; as a framework for analysis. A strong association was found between nurses&#8217; practice in projects and strategies used in integrated care, such as information sharing, guideline development and promotion, and case management, and projects with an ethnic focus, low income focus, chronic condition focus, and well-health focus. Whilst nurses undertook interventions most frequently at the individual practice level they were also strongly ii associated with the small proportion of interventions that were undertaken at the community level. The majority of interventions by nurses reflected the health promotion value of health persuasion, indicating a paternalist and individual-oriented philosophy. Nurses were engaged in two interventions that indicated a collectiveoriented philosophy - coalition building and community development, the latter reflecting health promotion values of negotiation, partnership and empowerment. The study demonstrated that nurses&#8217; practice in projects was predominantly centred on individual-focused population-based practice suggesting the need for a framework to assist nurses to transition their practice to include more activity at the community and systems levels. Without a reorientation of practice, nurses will remain limited in their ability to achieve health gains for populations. In response to this conclusion, and drawing on research results and reviewed literature, a new model, The &#8216;Primary Health Care interventions model&#8217; was constructed. Recommendations include advocacy for the acceptance of the model by the health funder, professional nursing bodies, health organisations, educational institutions, nurses, communities, and individuals.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Primary Health Care Interventions Model</field><field name="subject">Nursing</field><field name="subject">primary health care</field><field name="subject">health promotion</field><field name="subject">health determinants</field><field name="subject">chronic conditions</field><field name="subject">integrated care</field><field name="subject">New Zealand health reforms</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/507</field></doc><doc><field name="title">&#8216;The Paradise of the Southern Hemisphere&#8217;: The Perception of New Zealand and the Maori in Written Accounts of German-speaking Explorers and Travellers 1839-1889</field><field name="creator">Harrison, Oliver J.</field><field name="description">The aim of this research is to examine the much neglected body of writings on New Zealand and the Maori by German-speaking explorers and travellers during the colonising period of the 1840s to 1880s. To the nineteenth-century breed of visitor from Germany and Austria, 'Old' New Zealand often presented itself as an unexplored field of scientific curiosities, from botany and geology to ornithology and ethnology, at the same time as a paradise for immigrant workers. The investigation begins with an evaluation of the eighteenth-century account of Georg Forster, who accompanied Captain Cook on his second voyage to the South Pacific. Forster's account is entrenched in the early racial stereotypes and theories of the 'savage', and provides the first major primary source for all of German-speaking Europe up to the period under investigation. The second main source to be considered is the dominant 'paradise' image which evolved out of the propaganda of the New Zealand Company and continued right through the colonising era. The principal figures to be examined include Ernst Dieffenbach, the official Company naturalist, Friedrich August Krull, the first German Consul in New Zealand, Ferdinand von Hochstetter, the resident geologist on the Novara expedition, Julius von Haast, the founder and director of the Canterbury Museum, Andreas Reischek, the taxidermist and collector, as well as other notable visitors including Max Buchner, Franz Reuleaux, Otto Finsch, Alexander von H&#252;bner and Robert von Lendenfeld. Thus, it is the goal of this investigation to analyse the perception of New Zealand and the Maori in selected works by German-speaking explorers and travellers who arrived in the colony between 1839 and 1889 through, first of all, confronting the prevailing stereotypes and images inherent in the philosophical attitudes of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries towards the 'savage' and those present in the 'paradise' rhetoric of the British campaigners of colonisation, and secondly, examining the origins, patterns and evolution of their respective perceptions, impressions and opinions in order to reveal the true extent of their non-British 'Germanic' viewpoint.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Germany</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Travel Literature</field><field name="subject">History</field><field name="subject">Nineteenth Century</field><field name="subject">Explorers</field><field name="subject">Travellers</field><field name="subject">Natural History</field><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">Austria</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::430000 History and Archaeology::430100 Historical Studies::430102 History: Maori</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/703</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The functional role of anthocyanins in leaves</field><field name="creator">Neill, Samuel Oliver</field><field name="description">The anthocyanins, a relatively small group of pigments in the diverse flavonoid family, are largely responsible for the red-blue colouration in a large number plant species worldwide. Their occurrence in fruits and flowers seems to offer clear benefits in attracting pollinators and aiding seed dispersal, however their presence in the vacuoles of leaves remains obscure. The accumulation of anthocyanin pigments in leaves can be induced by a host of disparate environmental and anthropogenic stressors, such as UV-exposure, wounding, pathogen infection, high light, chilling, pollution, osmotic stress, and nutrient deficiency. Anthocyanins are in some species expressed throughout leaf development; in others the pigments are found exclusively in the young, rapidly expanding leaves, or at later stages of leaf senescence. Many researchers have explored the possible functional role(s) of anthocyanins within leaves, although none of the hypotheses provides a unified explanation for the diverse range of environmental triggers, or for the variability in the pigment&#8217;s location and expression at particular stages of development. Differences in the cellular location of cyanic pigments had little effect on the optical properties of leaves from several native New Zealand species. Instead, the absorptance of green-yellow light was strongly proportional to the concentration of anthocyanin. Red leaves absorbed up to 17 % more PAR (400-700 nm) than green leaves of same species. The reflectance of red light was independent of leaf anthocyanin content. In Lactuca sativa, the absorption of light by anthocyanic cell vacuoles in the upper epidermis led to a reduction in the light incident on subjacent chlorenchyma. Under high irradiances, the dissipation of excess energy through non-photochemical processes (qNP) was lower in the red regions of the leaves than in the green regions. Red L. sativa, maintained higher photochemical efficiencies (0PSII), and had greater rates of photochemical quenching (qP) than the green tissues. Moreover, the cyanic areas were photoinhibited significantly less (7 %), as measured by levels of maximum PSII efficiency (Fv/Fm), than green areas during a high light treatment of 1300 mmol m-2 s-1. Chloroplast suspensions from shade adapted L. sativa generated less superoxide (O2 -) through the Mehler reaction and had reduced rates of chlorophyll bleaching, when irradiated with 300 mmol m-2 s-1 of red light rather than white light. These data demonstrated the impact of the light-filtering effects of anthocyanins on the photophysiology of the leaves. Complementary to their light-shielding functions, anthocyanins also demonstrated potent antioxidant capabilities at pH values typical of both the cytoplasm and the vacuole. The addition of cyanidin-3-malonylglucoside, which was colourless at the cytoplasmic pH, to a chloroplast suspension receiving high irradiance resulted in the significant scavenging of O2 -. The red, flavylium form of anthocyanin was also oxidised by O2 -. After 15 minutes, this oxidation equated to a 40 % reduction in antioxidant potential of the anthocyanin, as measured by cyclic voltammetry. The data suggested that anthocyanins could provide widespread cellular protection to cellular membranes, organelles, and DNA. Analysis of the overall antioxidant defence in red and green leaves of Elatostema rugosum, a shade-adapted herb native to New Zealand, and Quintinia serrata, a native tree found on exposed ridges, provided evidence for a photoprotective role of anthocyanins. Red leaves of E. rugosum were on average five-times more effective at scavenging DPPH radicals than were green leaves. The anthocyanins constituted the most active phenolic component, providing a greater relative contribution to the antioxidant pool than the flavones, flavonols, and hydroxycinnamic acids. In contrast, red and green leaves of Q. serrata exhibited comparable ranges in antioxidant activities. The data suggest that for some species, anthocyanins can supplement the pool of low molecular weight antioxidants but are not a prerequisite for protection from oxidative stress. It is likely that the localised accumulation of anthocyanins in the leaves of Q. serrata serves to shield photosynthetic tissues that are the more susceptible to photodamage. In conclusion, the accumulation of anthocyanins represents a multifunctional mechanism to; i) directly reduce ROS through scavenging and possibly metal chelation, acting in conjunction with other antioxidants, and ii) to shield photosynthetic processes experiencing excessive irradiances, thereby reducing the extent of photooxidation, photoinhibition, and wasteful dissipatory systems. Such protection may be vital for leaves experiencing stressful environments.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/497</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Packetised wireless communication systems in interference limited environments</field><field name="creator">Orange, Matthew</field><field name="description">There is a strong likelihood that future wireless communication systems will employ packetised transmission techniques. Such an approach would provide a number of benefits, including the ability to integrate with emerging wired systems based on Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM). In addition, packet-based wireless networks would allow for diverse traffic types and in particular, speech and data traffic, to be integrated more readily. This thesis presents theoretical models and performance studies for various interference limited, packet-based, speech and data wireless communication systems. Two packetised random access protocols are considered for investigation, namely Slotted ALOHA (S-ALOHA) and Packet Reservation Multiple Access (PRMA). The S-ALOHA protocol is designed specifically for data traffic, whereas the PRMA protocol is optimised for speech traffic, with the ability to also cater for data traffic. Previously published research into S-ALOHA and PRMA has generally focused on the performance of these protocols in idealised single cell systems, free from cochannel interference. Previous studies have normally only considered simple signal propagation models that give little or no consideration to signal variability. A common assumption made in previous studies assumes that all packets involved in collisions with other packets are lost, while those packets received in the absence of other packets are received successfully. In this thesis, the performance of S-ALOHA and PRMA in more realistic multiple cell configurations, namely the outdoor cellular and in-building pico-cellular environments, has been considered. The fluctuations in received signal strengths have been modeled in this thesis using narrowband statistical propagation models. In addition, the assumption relating to packet collisions has been reconsidered in this thesis because practical receivers are often capable of locking onto one packet in the presence of other intra-cell and inter-cell interfering packets, due to the receiver capture effect. A capture probability model has been developed in this thesis, which defines the probability of a desired packet capturing the central cell base station in the presence of both intra-cell and inter-cell interfering packets. Accompanying Markov analysis theory has been developed to analyse the performance of multiple cell S-ALOHA and PRMA systems. Having developed the necessary framework, it has been possible to successfully analyse various multiple cell S-ALOHA and PRMA systems. These include a multiple cell data-only S-ALOHA system, multiple cell speech-only PRMA systems with and without selection diversity and speech packet retransmission and an integrated speech-data multiple cell PRMA system with selection diversity and speech packet retransmission.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/498</field></doc><doc><field name="title">High-resolution splatting</field><field name="creator">Kulka, Peter</field><field name="description">Volume rendering is a research area within scientific visualisation, where images are computed from volumetric data sets for visual exploration. Such data sets are typically generated by Computer aided Tomography, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Positron Emission Tomography or gained from simulations. The data sets are usually interpreted using optical models that assign optical properties to the volume and define the illumination and shading behaviour. Volume rendering techniques may be divided into three classes: object-order, image-order or hybrid methods. Image-order or ray casting methods shoot rays from the view plane into the volume and simulate the variation of light intensities along those rays. Object-order techniques traverse the volume data set and project each volume element onto the view plane. Hybrid volume rendering techniques combine these two approaches. A very popular object-order rendering method is called splatting. This technique traverses the volume data set and projects the optical properties of each volume element onto the view plane. This thesis consists of two parts. The first part introduces two new splatting methods, collectively called high-resolution splatting, which are based on standard splatting. Both high-resolution splatting methods correct errors of splatting by applying major modifications. We propose the first method, called fast high-resolution splatting, as an alternative to standard splatting. It may be used for quick previewing, since it is faster than standard splatting and the resulting images are significantly sharper. Our second method, called complete high-resolution splatting, improves the volume reconstruction, which results in images that are very close to those produced by ray casting methods.  The second part of the thesis incorporates wavelet analysis into high-resolution splatting. Wavelet analysis is a mathematical theory that decomposes volumes into multi-resolution hierarchies, which may be used to find coherence within volumes. The combination of wavelets with the high-resolution splatting method has the two advantages. Firstly the extended splatting method, called high-resolution wavelet splatting, can be directly applied to wavelet transformed volume data sets without performing an inverse transform. Secondly when visualising wavelet compressed volumes, only a small fraction of the wavelet coefficients need to be projected.  For all three versions of the new high-resolution splatting method, complexity analyses, comprehensive error and performance analyses as well as implementation details are discussed.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Volume Rendering</field><field name="subject">Volume Visualization</field><field name="subject">Splatting</field><field name="subject">Wavelets</field><field name="subject">Ray casting</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/503</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Contracting Cost Determinants of the Accounting Change for Income Tax</field><field name="creator">Wong, Norman</field><field name="description">This thesis adopts a contracting cost perspective to examine the decision of firms in New Zealand to change their accounting policy for income tax. It uses efficient contracting theory to posit that firms change to new accounting procedures if they lead to firm value maximisation. Specifically, an empirical study and six case studies are presented. These examine the contracting cost determinants of the decision of firms to change from the comprehensive tax allocation procedure to the partial tax allocation procedure to account for income tax which has the effect of (a) reducing the income tax expense recognised in the statement of financial performance, thereby increasing earnings after tax, and (b) reducing the deferred tax liability reported in the statement of financial position. I hypothesise that, under the comprehensive tax allocation procedure firms experiencing growth in depreciable assets encounter economic "friction" (i.e., contracting costs that do not maximise firm value). This is because comprehensive tax allocation recognises deferred tax liabilities which may not result in cash outflows, thereby producing an unintended and potentially ever growing liability on the statement of financial position. Overstatement of these liabilities could result in inadvertent adverse consequences such as perceived increased risk, leading to higher borrowing costs and debt covenant violation which is costly. As a result, these firms are likely to switch accounting procedures to mitigate the friction. Further, these firms are also likely to recontract with debtholders to incorporate the new, more efficient accounting technology (i.e., the partial tax allocation procedure) for monitoring compliance with the debt covenants. The results suggest the following. First, the extent of investment in depreciable assets, which gives rise to depreciation timing differences thereby increasing deferred tax liabilities, is an important determinant in the firms' decision to change interperiod tax allocation policy to the partial basis. In particular, firms that change are more likely to have greater levels and rates of investments in depreciable assets than those firms that remain using the comprehensive basis. This is consistent with the efficient contracting argument. Second, firms that change to the partial basis are more likely to include partial deferred tax liabilities in their leverage ratio calculations by choosing to do one of the following: (l) companies change their accounting-based debt covenants to allow the explicit inclusion of partial deferred tax liabilities; or (2) companies do not need to change their accounting-based debt covenants to include partial deferred tax liabilities if the accounting-based debt covenants already allow this; or (3) companies do not need to change their accounting-based debt covenants to include partial deferred tax liabilities if the accounting-based debt covenants state that liabilities include those reported using the accounting policies in the financial statements. The specification of any of these policies in companies' debt contracts is the result of efficient contracting. All these options are written in debt contracts to enable the efficient accounting policy to be used in calculating the leverage ratio constraint when changing firm circumstances create unintended economic "friction" with the use of an inefficient accounting policy. While there is empirical support for the efficient contracting argument, the effect that opportunism may have on firms' decision to change to the partial tax allocation basis cannot be totally ruled out.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/520</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Influence of Environmental Factors on Reproduction and Recruitment of Macomona liliana (Class: Bivalvia) in Manukau Harbour, New ZeaLand</field><field name="creator">Taylor, Michael D.</field><field name="description">The tellinid bivalve, Macomona liliana, is important to the structure and organisation of intertidal sandflat communities in Manukau Harbour. This thesis reports on features of the reproductive, larval supply and recruitment biology of Macomona liliana in relation to environmental factors in the harbour. Macomona liliana is gonochoric. In a mid-tide population sexual maturity occurred in animals &#8805; 22 mm (shell length). Spawning is asynchronous and protracted from late November to March throughout the harbour and timing of the reproductive cycle is associated with seasonal changes in environmental variables: temperature, salinity and seasonal production of phytoplankton and benthic microalgae. A visual gonad index was useful for establishing the main periods of spawning activity. Favourable habitats are at mid-tide on the large exposed sandflats characterised by well sorted fine sands. Less favourable habitats are in sheltered bays characterised by moderate-poorly sorted sands. A delay in the onset of gametogenesis in small compared to large adults (July-August of. May-June) indicates size and/or age dependent resource allocation to growth and reproduction. Adult size classes are evenly represented in favourable habitats whereas in less favourable habitats size classes are dominated by small adults. Favourable habitats have an equal sex ratio or are biased towards females whereas in less favourable habitats the converse is true. Early life-history stages are described and techniques employed to facilitate their identification in plankton and sediment samples. A spatial Taylor's Power Plot (slope, b = 1.31) demonstrates thorough mixing of larvae in the main channels. Spatial autocorrelation models confirm that densities of larvae are higher to the south of Karore Bank than to the north. The recruitment period is December to early March but varies between successive years. Physical transport processes, post-settlement migration and high levels of mortality in Boccardia syrtis tube-mats dominate recruitment patterns in the high energy environments. Larval supply and active habitat selection by settling larvae may, however, be significant determinants of population structure in sheltered bays. Generalisations are made on the effect of habitat quality on the reproduction and recruitment biology of the Manukau Harbour metapopulation.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270700 Ecology and Evolution::270702 Marine and estuarine ecology (incl. marine ichthyology)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/521</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigations in Graphical Statistics</field><field name="creator">Murrell, Paul R.</field><field name="description">This thesis is concerned with the design and development of statistical graphics software &#8211; programs to help draw graphs.

Firstly, graphs are used for exploratory data analysis &#8211; for detecting the message in a set of data &#8211; and secondly, graphs are used for data display &#8211; for presenting the message in a set of data. The most important feature of software for exploratory data analysis is extensibility. This is the ability to quickly and easily develop new graphical images and is vital for being able to explore a data set in many different ways. The most important feature of software for data display is customisation. This is the ability to fine-tune a graphical image in great detail and is vital for the production of presentation-quality graphics. In both cases it is important that a graphical image should be constructed to best explore or show-off the peculiarities of a specific data set. A pervading theme of this thesis is that statistical graphics software should be flexible. The software tools described herin allow graphical images to be modified in arbitrary ways; the structure of graphical images is also arbitrary and not restricted to standard graph formats; a simple, coherent method, based on a general constraint system, for developing novel graphical images is explored; and a mechanism for specifying the arrangement of the components of a graphical image is introduced.

The underlying biochemical nature of these rhythms however, has remained a mystery. The primary objective of this thesis was therefore to investigate the molecular control of circadian rhythms in L. cuprina using an integrative approach. To these ends, a dynamic molecular simulation model for L. cuprina was formulated using existing biochemical data on insect circadian clocks. The validity of this simulation model was subsequently tested at both molecular and behavioural levels. The basic molecular assumptions of the simulation model were tested by cloning a full length L. cuprina per cDNA and analysing its mRNA and protein expression levels. Isolation of the 4 Kb L. cuprina per cDNA revealed the conservation of three functional domains known to be important for circadian clock function; namely the PAS dimerisation motif (with 92% identity to D. melanogaster at the amino acid level), and the cytoplasmic and nuclear localisation domains (with 85% and 80% identity respectively). A fourth domain, the threonine-glycine (TG) repeat region, was also found to be conserved, but severely truncated in L. cuprina. No length variation was found in the TG repeat of flies collected from several different latitudinal zones, and no correlation was detected between sequences flanking the repeat and latitude of collection of flies. Thus, the contention that the TG repeat region plays a role in temperature compensation of the circadian clock is cast in doubt. Expression analyses (using quantitative RT-PCR) showed per mRNA levels to undergo diel oscillations with a period (24 h) and peak phase (Zt 12) consistent with the Drosophila data. PER-immunoreactive protein oscillations were also demonstrated, with peak immunoreactivity lagging approximately 3 h behind peak mRNA levels. The behavioural predictions of the model were tested by recording adult locomotor activity under different light regimes. The simulation model successfully predicted free-run, entrainment, the effect of short light pulses, and the effects of constant lighting on behavioural rhythms. Disparities between the simulated and real phase response cnrves for L. cuprina are hypothesised to be indicative of an ealier nuclear entry time of the PER-TIM dimer in L. cuprina compared with D. melanogaster. The three different approaches of simulation modellingo molecular analysis and behavioural investigation are integrated in the discussion in order to help provide a comprehensive explanation of circadian function in L. cuprina. The benefits of an integrated approach to the analysis of circadian function are discussed, as is the relevance of the present findings to the development of a clock-based control strategy for this economically important pest species.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270500 Zoology::270505 Entomology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/518</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Hei tautoko i te reo : Maori language regeneration and wha&#772;nau bookreading practices</field><field name="creator">Hohepa, Margie Kahukura</field><field name="description">I nga rua tekau ma rima tau nei ka puta ake &#275;tahi kaupapa m&#257;tauranga hei whakaora i te reo t&#363;turu o Aotearoa, i te reo M&#257;ori me &#333;na tikanga.

In the last quarter of the twentieth century a number of educational initiatives have emerged aimed at regenerating M&#257;ori, the indigenous language of Aotearoa-New Zealand. This thesis explores the premise that in order for such educational initiatives to be effective, those who have intimate contact with students in their personal domains of life also need to be interacting with them in the target language. It examines interactions in family literacy practices as a constitutive context for adult M&#257;ori language elaboration and acquisition processes. 'Literacy' is conceived as providing tools within sociocultural practices to amplify M&#257;ori language regeneration and cultural persistence. Across two separate studies the home literacy practices of ten families with new entrant children in a M&#257;ori medium sclooling initiative, kura kaupapa M&#257;ori, are examined. The results of the studies indicate that specific literacy-related strategies sited in bookreading with 5 year olds can increase the use of M&#257;ori language within homes, thereby increasing the effectiveness of M&#257;ori language regeneration programmes and initiatives across school and family settings.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420300 Cultural Studies::420306 Maori cultural studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/517</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies in Marine Natural Product Synthesis, Isolation and Ecology</field><field name="creator">Lindsay, Brent Steven</field><field name="description">Previous studies indicated the marine pyridoacridone alkaloid ascididemin possessed a unique biological profile. Investigation of synthetic routes to ascididemin led to the discovery that ascididemin precursors possessed a wide range of biological activities. One precursor possessed hollow fiber in vivo antitumoral activity and continuing in vivo studies at the NCI, using subcutaneous xenograft assays, are in progress. A crystal structure of a precursor indicates that these tetracyclic heterocycles are planar, suggesting intercalation as a mechanism of antitumoral action. Ascididemin was synthesized by two novel ring E forming reactions. The superior methodology was also useful in the preparation of analogues, such as kuanoniamine A. Ascididemin possessed promising hollow fiber in vivo antitumoral activity but was poorly active in a subcutaneous xenograft study. Ascididemin was incapable of exerting antitumoral activity at a distance and further analogues were prepared to address this problem. Ten analogues were prepared, with all the non-bromine containing analogues selected for in vivo evaluation at the NCI. Two ring A analogues were prepared by a thennew synthetic route, including the antiviral natural product 11-hydroxyascididemin. 11-Methoxyascididemin was selected for hollow fiber evaluation. Two bromine containing ring D analogues were prepared, including the antifungal natural product 2-bromoleptoclinidinone. A crystal structure on 2-bromoleptoclinidinone was the first determined on a pyridoacridone alkaloid and the molecule was planar, further supporting an intercalative mechanism of action. Due to non-selective antitumoral cytotoxicity, ring D analogues are not useful antitumoral agents. Six carbon-based ring E analogues were prepared by novel methodology. All 6-substituted analogues assessed were selected for in vivo antitumoral evaluation. Hollow fiber antitumoral activity decreased with bulk of the substituent. 6-Methylascididemin has been selected for subcutaneous xenograft studies. The 5-substituted analogue prepared gave the best in vitro antitumoral profile of all alkaloids in this study and has been selected for in vivo evaluation. Ring E substituted N-8-deaza-ascididemin analogues possessed no antitumoral activity, highlighting the importance of the 1,10-phenanthroline-like bay region of ascididemin in antitumoral activity. Another four structurally novel, quinoid containing alkaloids have been selected tor in vivo evaluation. While ascididemin was the only compound capable of topoisomerase II&#945; cleavable complex stabilization, related alkaloids possessed a similar level of inhibitory action against this enzyme. This further supports intercalation as the dominant mechanism of action for pyridoacridone alkaloids. Ecological roles of four natural pyridoacridone alkaloids were assessed. Alkaloids were species specific antifeedant agents against important consumers. These alkaloids may have a long term detrimental effect on predator physiology, due to the well established ability of these alkaloids to interfere with cell proliferation. Ascididemin elicited avoidance responses in numerous marine species. Ascididemin has no antifouling activity against macrofoulers. Microbiological assessment of ascididemin, 11-hydroxyascididemin and 2-bromoleptoclinidinone indicated that modification of the ascididemin chromophore leads to the directing of antimicrobial activity towards a different phyla of parasites. Pyridoacridone alkaloids may be part of a non-antibody based immune system. All studies point to pyridoacridone alkaloids enhancing the eventual reproductive success of the organism. Biological and chemical evaluation of 29 New Zealand ascidians has been performed. Significant biological activity was detected in ten ascidians. Novel metabolites isolated were 2-(3'-bromo-4'-hydroxyphenol)ethanamine (Cnemidocarpa bicomuta) and 1,3-dimethylguanine (unidentified ascidian). Known metabolites isolated were 1,3-dimethylisoguanine (Cnemidocarpa bicomuta) and rubrolides A, B and C (unidentified ascidian). The survey highlighted the importance of overexpressed purine bases in ascidian metabolism. No physiological roles for these overexpressed purines are as yet apparent. Our study of NZ ascidians has led to the isolation of many compounds previously isolated from sponges. The widespread distribution of such metabolites gives credence to the theory that common metabolite-generating genes are present in both phyla, due to the evolutionary success of these genes. Two optically active 9-(5-S-methyl-5-sulfinyl-lyxofuranosyl)-9H-purin-6-amine (lyxosyl-MTAS) nucleosides were isolated from the nudibranch Doriopsis flabellifera. This is the first report of any lyxosyl-MTAS nucleoside as either a natural or synthetic product.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270700 Ecology and Evolution::270702 Marine and estuarine ecology (incl. marine ichthyology)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/509</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dipolarity and God</field><field name="creator">Brimblecombe, Mark D.</field><field name="description">The Christian doctrine of the Trinity is about one God in three divine persons, with one of these three becoming human (without ceasing to be divine) in Jesus of Nazareth. The concept of dipolarity is about the combination of complementary but opposite principles. The most widely recognised examples of this concept are one-many and being-becoming. But what is not so recognised is that these dipolarities are clearly illustrated in the Christian doctrine of God as Trinity. By contrast, philosophers and theologians throughout history have often attempted to reconcile or synthesise these dipolar 'opposites', or to place one over the other. This quest, enshrined in Neoplatonic philosophy, has influenced the development of the Christian doctrine of God (less so in regard to the particular doctrine of the Trinity just mentioned). Divine 'Oneness' and 'Being' have often been regarded as exclusive of 'many'and 'becoming'. But the theological insight that God the Trinity is a relational and active personal being, may be contrasted with this depiction of God as singular absolute and beyond becoming. From a trinitarian foundation, a theology of God can be developed which expresses both the being-becoming and one-many dipolarities. This means revising elements of traditional Christian theism, especially in regard to understanding the eternal and unchangeable God as also becoming and many (in relation).</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/567</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Effective Order of Singly-Implicit Methods for Stiff Differential Equations</field><field name="creator">Chen, David Jen Lung</field><field name="description">Singly-implicit Runge-Kutta methods (SIRK) are designed for stiff differential equations. The existing code STRIDE based on these methods has been shown to be efficient for stiff problems, especially for high dimensional problems. However, SIRK methods with order greater than 2 possess the undesirable property that some of their abscissae are outside the integration interval. In order to improve the numerical behaviour of SIRK methods, we need to overcome this drawback. While retaining the original advantages of SIRK methods as much as possible, it would be advantageous to have more free parameters in choosing the coefficients for these methods. Recently, two generalizations of SIRK methods were introduced to overcome this difficulty. One is the so-called "DESI" (Diagonally Extended Singly-Implicit Runge-Kutta) method in which some additional diagonally implicit stages are added to the corresponding classical SIRK method. It turns out that there is more freedom in choosing the abscissae because of these extra stages. The other generalization is the so-called "ESIRK" (Effective order Singly-Implicit Runge-Kutta) method which adopts the idea of "effective order" so that the desirable free parameters come from "perturbed" initial values. The first approach has been verified to be a successful generalization. The existing variable order code DESI was shown to be more efficient than STRIDE, and competes well with the BDF (Backward Differentiation Formulae) code LSODE for many stiff problems (Butcher, Cash, Diamantakis [24] 1996). For the second approach, the numerical behaviour of ESIRK methods with variable stepsize, is closely related to the choice of the abscissae. In this thesis, it is shown that the classical SIRK methods are not the best choice with respect to the local truncation error. We analyze the numerical behaviour of the ESIRK methods both theoretically and experimentally. The choices of the abscissae for these methods are investigated. It is found that except when s = 2 (s is the number of stages in the method), the numerical results obtained with equally spaced abscissae in [0,1] are better than the corresponding SIRK methods for s = 3,. . .,6,8. Several alternative choices are also given. Some experimental variable-stepsize ESIRK codes are designed and are compared with the famous IRK codes SDIRK4, RADAU5 and the BDF code LSODE. The numerical results show that ESIRK methods are successful generalizations of the SIRK methods and are good candidates as solvers for stiff problems. In attempting to increase the efficiency of ESIRK methods, the idea of adding some additional diagonal stages is proposed. The generalizations of the ESIRK methods, called "EDESI" (Effective order Diagonally Extended Singly-Implicit Runge-Kutta) methods, are shown to be promising in solving stiff problems and are also successful generalizations of DESI and ESIRK methods.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/508</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ripe for Harvest</field><field name="creator">Brailsford, Ian</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/516</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Occurrence and Characterisation of Enterococci in Terrestrial and Aquatic Environments</field><field name="creator">Anderson, Sally Ann</field><field name="description">The use of enterococci as a microbiological indicator of water quality requires an understanding of the sources, persistence, and ecology of this group of bacteria in the environment. This research describes a series of investigations undertaken to describe the abundance, occurrence, and diversity of enterococci from aquatic and terrestrial environments. A screening protocol for environmentally sourced enterococci was developed to describe species and sub-species variability. This protocol combined classical microbiological methods of selective culture and biochemical characterisation, with molecular techniques including gene probe screening for identity and RAPD-PCR for genotypic diversity. Preliminary studies on the occurrence of enterococci in terrestrial and aquatic environments suggested that these organisms are ubiquitous. However, abundance varied between individual samples taken from terrestrial (e.g. leaf litter, sand, seaweed, animal faeces) or aquatic (marine or freshwater) environments, complicating the ability to predict the enterococci load from these sources. Enumeration of enterococci from bathing beach environments indicated occasionally high levels from seaweed and sand, where levels of up to 660 CFU/100 g (wet weight) were recorded from aged and degrading seaweed but not from fresh seaweed samples. Restriction enzyme analysis (REA) of isolates from degraded seaweed indicated a dominance of clonal populations and supported the notion of replication or survival of strains. Laboratory studies conducted to investigate enterococci persistence and growth on seaweed were not conclusive, although there was some evidence to suggest enterococci replication was occurring. This was indicated by molecular fingerprinting (REA analysis), which showed that the inoculated strain persisted for the full duration of experiments (up to 28 days). The isolation of non-inoculum strains from seaweed treatments, combined with increased abundance of these strains with incubation, suggested the persistence or replication of enterococci that were naturally occurring on seaweed. To investigate the occurrence of enterococci in bathing environments a statistical analysis of Auckland Regional Council (ARC) bathing water quality data was undertaken. This analysis indicated a strong positive correlation between enterococci and turbidity, and hence turbidity may serve as a useful physical measure to indicate deteriorating water quality. Surveys of three marine bathing beaches on Auckland's North Shore (Long Bay, Mairangi Bay, and Rothesay Bay) indicated the abundance of enterococci in all bathing beach environments surveyed. These included marine and fresh water, sand, seaweed, and stream sediment, and a significant association between enterococci levels found in the sand and in the seaweed. Enterococci screening protocols were evaluated for use in describing enterococci species and sub-species diversity in bathing beach environments. This investigation showed a diversity of enterococci from all beach environmental sources, with highest levels of species diversity from marine and stream water. Enterococci diversity did not provide clues as to the sources in marine water samples. RAPD-PCR analysis and phenotypic screening of enterococci isolates did not indicate a pattern of niche-specific associations of enterococci strains, and there was no strong evidence from this study that enterococci sub-species associate with specific environments. However, the presence of identical genotypes indicated that enterococci can persist and possibly replicate in environments such as sand and seaweed. Calculation of similarity coefficients from Ent. faecalis and Ent. casseliflavus sub-species groupings indicated a greater level of sub-specific similarity between selected environments, for example, seaweed:sand, marine water:stream water, seaweed:marine water, although this was not a guarantee that environments were biologically or ecologically associated. Where an elevated level of enterococci is measured in the absence in identifiable pollution source the separation of pigmented from non-pigmented enterococci was proposed as an indicator of the environmental or faecal nature of the enterococci within the sample. Although not tested under controlled conditions, this concept was found to have good utility for discriminating sources from elevated marine bathing water samples. Enterococci from one of 13 elevated ARC marine water samples examined was shown to be environmentally derived, with 5 of the 13 samples attributed to putative human or animal faecal sources. With further validation, this concept may be a useful means of determining source.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270700 Ecology and Evolution::270702 Marine and estuarine ecology (incl. marine ichthyology)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/523</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The retention of picoplankton by the pacific oyster, Crassostrea gigas, and implications for oyster culture</field><field name="creator">Bell, Andrew Harwood</field><field name="description">Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas) farming in New Zealand has reached a point where the pressures on resources appear likely to constrain current, and future, development. To maintain industry growth, security of juvenile oyster (spat) supply and productivity gains within the existing farm leases, are becoming industry imperatives. The use of hatchery technology could achieve both of these requirements, but it is expensive to establish and maintain. The additional expense of a hatchery could be offset by the establishment of, for example, a selective breeding program to enhance oyster productivity and/or marketability. Consequently a pilot-scale oyster hatchery facility was constructed to investigate the potential for establishing hatchery production of Pacific oysters in New Zealand. This study showed that in the pilot-scale hatchery, oysters could be successfully spawned from in-season broodstock, the eggs fertilised and the resultant larvae reared through to settlement for on-growing to adult size. This process was successful for both oysters selected for morphological characteristics and those which were not. On-growing of the resultant stock indicated growth rate could be normal relative to wild caught oysters spat, although data was limited by the small scale of the experiment. However, an investigation of broodstock conditioning, to achieve out-of-season spawning, was less successful. Disease occurred and condition was lost in some broodstock, suggesting they were enduring stress within the conditioning system. The microalgal food supply was examined but the clearance rate of the microalgal species suggested they were an acceptable feed supply which agreed with previous reports of successful conditioning techniques. Comparing the pilot-scale facility in this study with descriptions of facilities which reported successful broodstock conditioning suggested that the use of a microfiltered recirculating water supply, as opposed to the more common flow-through, natural seawater systems containing a range of small size particles, limited necessary nutrient and/or maturation factors and may have had a significant impact on conditioning. The nanoplanktonic (&lt; 10 &#956;m), food resource, which includes key microalgal species such as Chaetoceros spp. and Isochrysis spp., is generally considered the primary food resource for suspension feeding bivalves, including C. gigas. However, the picoplanktonic fraction (&lt; 3 &#956;m) can provide the largest proportion of this food resource in the water column in terms of abundance and biomass. Consequently, an investigation of the in situ retention of picoplankton populations (picoeukaryotes, Synechococcus-type cyanobacteria and heterotrophic bacteria) by oysters was undertaken. Flow cytometry was used to quantify the picoplankton populations in water samples taken from the inhalant and exhalant feeding currents of individual oysters, allowing retention efficiency of the particles to be calculated. Five picoplankton populations were identifiable by flow cytometry (picoeukaryotes, heterotrophic bacteria and 3 populations tentatively identified as cyanobacteria) and accounted for a large proportion (up to 97 %) of the estimated available carbon (picoplankton + microalgae) in Kerikeri Inlet water. Generally the heterotrophic bacteria accounted for the largest proportion of the biomass with up to 564 &#177; 51 ng C ml-1. Retention of each picoplankton population was found to be variable and not directly related to particle concentration. Cyanobacteria (Cy2 population) were retained with the greatest efficiency (up to 42 &#177; 4.4 %), followed by heterotrophic bacteria (up to 38 &#177; 4.5 %) and picoeukaryotes (up to 12 &#177; 3.8 %). Overall more picoplankton biomass was retained during the summer months, of which the heterotrophic bacteria made the largest contribution in either cell number or estimated carbon retained. Tracking of the condition and constituent fractions (glycogen, lipid and protein) of the subject oysters showed that in the summer months, post-spawn, these levels were lowest, indicting a period of nutritional stress. This appeared to suggest that C. gigas was able to alter its retention efficiency to expand the range of particles captured, and consequently the available nutrient pool. The retention of greater quantities of heterotrophic bacteria may allow for the acquisition of essential nutrients required for growth and later gametogenesis (such as B vitamins). However, it is also possible that the heterotrophic bacteria mediate access to otherwise inaccessible, or inefficiently accessed, nutrient resources through their degradation of, for example, crystalline cellulose. Consequently, the microbial flora associated with the oyster gut was investigated. An initial investigation, cultivating bacteria from gut contents, showed considerable variability in the numbers of colonies present within and between samples, but was inconclusive for identifying differences in species diversity. Using culture independent histological and 16S rDNA PCR/RFLP techniques to investigate the oyster gut microflora a spirochaete flora, commonly associated with bivalve crystalline styles, was clearly present. Molecular analyses provided evidence of other bacterial in the gut. A signature RFLP band pattern was found in oysters at low tide and this generally reoccurred in oysters that had been immersed for varying lengths of time up to high tide. However, the signature RFLP pattern became more dilute as immersion time/potential feeding time extended. The isolation of culturable bacteria from the oyster gut allowed characterisation and identification of a subset of the oyster gut microflora. 16S rDNA sequence analysis from selected isolates showed a predominance of Vibrio spp. These bacteria had previously been associated with marine molluscs, including as symbionts. Characterisation of these and other isolates from oyster gut showed a diversity of attributes including the ability to degrade cellulose. This suggests the bacterial production of enzymes, such as cellulases, which have been reported by other researchers as being present in ineffectual or low native levels in oysters. Consequently the bacterial presence in the oyster gut may be essential to efficient nutrient acquisition. The results of these investigations have highlighted the potential importance of the heterotrophic bacteria to C. gigas. To date, bacteria have received relatively little attention in terms of their potential nutritive contribution to oysters, primarily due to observations that they are retained with low efficiency. However, even at low retention efficiencies the potential nutritive contribution is large due to the available abundances of heterotrophic bacteria. While the mechanisms and controls of bivalve suspension feeding have yet to be fully elucidated, the published literature indicates that selective mechanisms are available to bivalves including C. gigas and this current research suggests that even pico-sized particles, retained with apparently low efficiency, can be subject to selection. The importance of the heterotrophic bacteria to C. gigas requires further investigation as it will have implications for not only hatchery production, but also farm management, public health and environmental impact monitoring.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270700 Ecology and Evolution::270702 Marine and estuarine ecology (incl. marine ichthyology)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/504</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Calf Pregastric Lipase-A Kinetic Study</field><field name="creator">Manuel, Robyn Desma</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/519</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Molecular and Ecological Aspects of Heliothis Armigera</field><field name="creator">Waghorn, Tania Susanne</field><field name="description">The species status and host range of Heliothis armigera was investigated. DNA profiling, mitochondrial DNA sequencing, RAPD's, along with traditional morphological and crossing methods were used to investigate micro, macro and mega-population structuring. Thirty-six new host records were added, of which a number are important common weeds and crops. Mortality due to parasitoids and fungal infections were quantified on many host species. Genetic analysis of the COII and the AT-rich regions of the mitochondrial DNA showed very high levels of variation, as did the DNA profiling using the probes (CA)n and 33.15. The morphological analyses also showed variation, but to a lesser degree and without statistical significance. The variation found at all levels and in all aspects is discussed with respect to caterpillar host-plants and geographical location. All host-plant populations of caterpillars showed very high levels of genetic variability. However, the population of caterpillars found on Sulla (Hedysarium coronarium) was significantly more variable than those found on Lotus and Lucerne when compared using DNA profiling. The sequences obtained from the two mtDNA regions also showed considerable variation, a great percentage of which was uninformative. This variation did not allude to any structuring of caterpillar populations with respect to host-plant or geographical location. H. armigera is genetically a very variable species which does not equate with any population structuring present in the host-plant or geographical populations investigated here.

The last four decades have seen weather-modification oscillate wildly between pseudo-science, orthodox science, and now apparently, bad science. Paradoxically, widespread private scientific scepticism towards weather-modification has been matched by wholesale public belief in its efficacy. Weather-modifiers have been accused of causing drought instead of creating rain, of ruining harvests rather than encouraging cultivated wealth. Public groups have objected to this most social science on aesthetic, cultural, economic, environmental, legal and theological grounds. Far from being an interesting aside in meteorological history, weather-modification lurks perpetually on the policy horizon. To therefore ignore the circumstances under which weather-modification was first legitimised is foolish, since the recurrence of these material conditions could reinstate its scientific position despite scanty evidence of its efficacy. Not only is the current practice of weather-modification a waste of time and money, it postpones pressing decisions regarding water allocation and conservation, and it annoys a lot of people in the process. In the final analysis, attempts at weather-modification illustrate many key issues surrounding the relationships between and among science, technology and society, for the weather-modification story tells us important things about the problems that arise when there is no time lag between a supposed breakthrough and its subsequent application, the difficulties which scientists encounter when working in politically charged atmospheres, and the problems that follow when such work intrudes upon the public domain.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/575</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Trade Policy, Processing, and New Zealand Forestry</field><field name="creator">Gilbert, John</field><field name="description">The New Zealand forestry sector is well recognised as being amongst the oldest and most historically, politically, and economically significant sectors in this country's European history. In recent years, in particular those following the major restructuring of the industry which took place in the latter half of the 1980s, the forestry industry has come under increasing scrutiny for its potential as a major source of export revenue for New Zealand, as supplies have begun to vastly outstrip demand. The sector is also a significant employer, and contributor to national income. Moreover, it is an industry which has come to embody the current New Zealand debate on foreign ownership, environmental concerns, and in particular, the costs and benefits of encouraging the domestic processing of New Zealand's resources. However, despite its substantial importance to the New Zealand economy, surprisingly little extensive research has been undertaken on the forestry sector. This is particularly so with respect to trade policy aspects. It is a well accepted fact that there has been an imbalance of effort within New Zealand which has led to numerous models of the forest resource and limited attention to the market, and in particular models of the small open economy and international trade. This study partially corrects this imbalance. It identifies and examines three core issues with respect to the issue of  log export restrictions; the impact on processing and welfare; the effect of foreign ownership of the resource in respect of the income transfers which result from processing incentives: and the possibility of utilising export restrictions as a retaliatory strategy against escalating tariff structures. It also examines the impact of  liberalisation of forestry products trade on a region-wide basis. The methodology employed in this study is a combination of formal economic modelling, and counterfactual simulation using computable general equilibrium (CGE) modelling techniques. We make use of both our own purpose-built single country model, and the existing GTAP model in our simulations. The study makes a contribution to the existing literature by incorporating foreign ownership into a formal analysis of processing incentives, developing a new CGE model of the New Zealand economy which incorporates econometric estimates of key relational parameters, utilising this model to evaluate the costs of export restrictions - which are shown to be substantial, and utilising the GTAP to provide insights into the possible effect of the APEC Early Voluntary Sector Liberalisation strategy - where we find evidence to suggest that MFN liberalisation by APEC members may lower group welfare.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/515</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An evaluation of piano sound and vibration leading to improvements through modification of the material properties of the structure</field><field name="creator">Keane, Martin</field><field name="description">A study of vibrations and sound radiation in upright and grand pianos has been made to determine whether the piano may be improved by altering the materials of the component parts which are traditionally fabricated in timber.  Modal analysis and sound level measurements of an upright piano has shown that the radiation from the case is at least 20 dB lower than the radiation from the soundboard, and therefore the case is not a significant determinant of piano tone.  A method was developed for separating piano sound and vibrations into broadband and tonal components and used to compare the performance of upright and grand pianos. Using this method it was found that the broadband vibration level was twice as high in the uprights as in the grands.  A finite element model of an upright piano was developed and used to demonstrate that replacing the keybed with a higher impedance material than conventionally used would reduce the key vibration level, and hence bring the uprights closer in performance to grand pianos, and improve the 'feel' of the instrument for the player. The keybed of one of a pair of identical pianos was replaced with high density fibreboard, and subsequent objective measurements showed that the broadband component of key vibrations was reduced by 3.2 dB while the radiated sound was unchanged. A controlled subjective comparison between the modified and unmodified pianos undertaken by experienced players showed that a statistically significant number preferred the modified piano, and that the upright piano had been improved.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Piano</field><field name="subject">Pibration</field><field name="subject">Modal analysis</field><field name="subject">Finite element model</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1430</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Economic evaluation of active labour market policy in New Zealand 1989 to 1997</field><field name="creator">Perry, Geoffrey E</field><field name="description">Active labour market programmes are an important component of government labour market policy internationally and in New Zealand. The growth in unemployment, and in particular male and long term unemployment, since the mid 1980's in New Zealand have contributed to the enhanced role of active labour market programmes in government policy. In the early 1990's the New Zealand government introduced a menu of interventions including subsidy, work experience and training programmes. Concomitant with this development has been increased pressure from political, business and social groups to assess the effectiveness of this approach in lowering unemployment. The aim of this thesis is to evaluate the effect of active labour market policy utilised in New Zealand from 1989 to 1997. Whether or not these active labour market interventions were beneficial to those males who participated in them, the effect of treatment upon the treated, is the parameter estimated. The range of programmes makes it possible to analyse a number of programme evaluation issues. These include the overall question of the impact of subsidy, work experience and training programmes in general, but also other specific research questions. In particular the range of subsidy programmes makes it possible to identify that subsidies to private sector firms are more effective than those to public sector organisations. The effectiveness of start-up subsidies for the unemployed are also evaluated and found to be beneficial. The effects of participation upon selected education and ethnic groups are also estimated. Since there is no one estimation approach that works in all circumstances, both regression and matching estimators are used. In order to achieve this it is necessary to create two estimation datasets as the data requirements vary for each technique. The main findings from the research are that participation in active labour market programmes is beneficial in reducing the length of time that participants are registered as unemployed. Work experience programmes have the largest impact, followed by subsidies. The effect of training programmes is smallest. The major beneficial effect occurs in the year following participation and then reduces in subsequent years. There are also some important methodological findings, including the sensitivity of results to the time frame, to the datasets chosen, and to the estimation techniques used.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::340000 Economics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/525</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Novel Interferometric Techniques in Profilometry and Spectrometry</field><field name="creator">Helg, Tina Louise</field><field name="description">The work in this thesis is in the fields of profilometry and Fourier transform spectrometry. Deformation measurement of diffuse objects by phase stepping was achieved by thermal frequency drift in a HeNe laser. The system was easy to construct, required no specialised components, was immune to the effects of piezo-actuator hysteresis, and was capable of producing phase maps in which noise was less than 1/20&#955;. A method was proposed for measuring absolute surface profile by scanning frequency over the range of a white light source. The coincidence technique of coherence radar was used to measure surface profiles in three dimensions to micron accuracy. Spatial techniques were developed to process the large data set quickly and efficiently. A novel Fourier transform spectrometer was developed to measure the spectrum of narrowband light sources. Heterodyning techniques gave a resolution of 0.01nm with a free spectral range of =2.5nm. The Sagnac common path design afforded immunity to vibration. The mode structure and mode hopping characteristics of a typical laser diode were measured as a function of diode injection current. An improved Fourier transform spectrometer was developed. Based on a Michelson interferometer. The instrument could resolve to 0.013nm over a =3nm free spectral range. Instrument operation was simplified and functionality was extended to non point sources.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::240000 Physical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/603</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Novel Methods for the Removal of Colour from Pulp and Paper Mill Wastewater</field><field name="creator">Wingate, Kathryn G.</field><field name="description">Wastewater produced during pulp and paper manufacture is often highly coloured. Along with a decrease in the aesthetic appeal of the receiving water, the coloured material also reduces the penetration of the sunlight through the water which may decrease photosynthetic rates and affect aquatic productivity. As a result, there is strong pressure from environmental regulators for mills to reduce the colour of these wastewaters. Currently there is no sustainable colour removal technology available to remove this colour, predominantly due to economical restraints. The current study was undertaken with the aim of assessing novel and environmentally and economically sustainable technologies for the treatment of colour in pulp and paper mill wastewaters. A New Zealand softwood integrated bleached kraft mill was used for the technology assessment case studies. A synoptic survey of the mill was performed to locate the major sources of wastewater constituents and to select the most appropriate waste streams for application of these technologies. It was found that bleach plant wastewater was a significant source of colour (34% total mill load), dissolved organic carbon (DOC, 32%), and soluble chemical oxygen demand (sCOD, 25%), and was the predominant source of absorbable organic halides (AOX, ~100 %). Given these relative contributions, the concentrated flows arising from this source, and the relative case of retro-fitting a treatment process at full-scale, this wastewater was selected for remediation. The bleach plant wastewater is discharged in two waste streams, the acidic stream (pH 2) and the alkaline stream (pH 11). Two systems were investigated as colour removal tools; one chemical, the other biological. Both systems was chosen as suitable for the remediation of bleach plant wastewater (i.e. functioned in the required pH and temperature range), and because they were novel systems which had not been previously considered for removal of colour from wastewater. The first technology was an advanced oxidative process (AOP) which utilised macrocyclic tetraamide iron(III) complexes. These specially-designed complexes catalytically activate hydrogen peroxide and were developed by Collins et al., at Carnegie Mellon University. The activated complexes had previously been shown to be able to delignify and remove residual colour from kraft pulp. Preliminary trials indicated that these complexes would also have the potential to remove colour from pulp mill wastewaters. The second technology was an enzymatic treatment that utilised the enzyme cellobiose dehydrogenase (CDH). Although the broader purpose of these enzymes in biological systems has not been firmly established, previous studies have demonstrated that CDH reactions could reduce quinones. Quinones are highly coloured, lignin-related species produced during the bleaching of pulp that have been hypothesised to contribute a significant proportion of the colour found in bleached kraft mill wastewaters. It was therefore postulated that this enzyme could form the basis of a biological colour treatment for bleached kraft mill wastewaters, with particular focus on colour removal. Studies were undertaken to assess the effects of substrate concentrations, pH, temperature and time. As the AOP technology functioned best under alkaline conditions, it was selected to remediate the alkaline bleach plant waste stream. Optimal conditions were determined at pH 11,9 and 7. At pH 11 the optimal conditions were found to be an activator concentration of 2 &#181;M (0.9 mg L-1), a hydrogen peroxide concentration of 26 mM (0.75 g L-1), 40&#186;C and 4 hours. As the pH decreased to 9, and then 7, more activator and peroxide was required to remove similar levels of colour from the alkaline waste stream. Under optimal conditions, the AOP was able to remove 47% of the colour from alkaline stage bleaching wastewaters. Additionally, using these conditions the AOP could remove 25% of the chlorinated organic material (as AOX), however it had no effect on the sCOD of the wastewater. For the enzymatic treatment two strains of enzyme were assessed. One strain, purified from the soft-rot fungus Humicola insolens,preferred alkaline conditions and was used to treat the alkaline stage bleaching wastewater, and the other strain, purified from the white-rot fungus Phanerochaete chrysosporium, preferred acid pH and was used to remediate the acid stage wastewater. Conditions required for the enzyme strain that preferred alkaline conditions were 0.01 IU of CDH, 7 mM (2.4 g L-1) of cellobiose, 40&#186;C and 4 days at pH 7. The enzyme was able to remove 41 % of the colour from the waste stream, however the enzyme treatment had no effect on the chlorinated organic content or the sCOD of the wastewater. Due to a limitation in acidophilic enzyme, optimal conditions were not fully characterised. However, it was found that using 0.1 IU of CDH,40&#186;C and 4 days at pH 4.5 resulted in a colour removal from the acid stage bleaching wastewater similar to that achieved for the enzyme strain that preferred alkaline conditions when treating the alkaline stage bleaching wastewater. An investigation of the structural changes in the wastewater organic material during treatment indicated that the AOP predominantly removed phenolic structures from the wastewater, in addition to structures containing aliphatic double bonds and carbonyl groups. In contrast, CDH solely reduced quinone structures. These findings were supported by studies using model compounds. With AOP treatment there were reaction rate differences for a range of phenolic model compounds with the most reactive compounds being vanillomandelic acid and catechol. Both technologies were able to remediate wastewater from other sources around the mill, such as the combined whole mill wastewater and the post-secondary treatment system wastewater. Removal efficiencies under optimal conditions were in the range 55 to 65%. In addition to the removal of colour from wastewater produced during pine processing, both technologies could also remediate wastewater produced during the processing of eucalypt, a hardwood. In this case treatment efficiencies were somewhat lower (33 and 27% for the AOP and enzyme technologies, respectively) possibly due to the difference in the nature of the chromophores in the hardwood wastewater. An environmental risk assessment of both technologies was undertaken. The results from this assessment indicated that the AOP treatment did not improve overall biological treatability of the wastewater. The enzyme treatment improved treatability of the wastewater by 92%. when measured as oxygen uptake of a microbial population. An investigation of the molecular weight distribution found the molecular weight distribution of the wastewater was not altered during treatment with the AOP, however it was altered during enzyme treatment with a preferential decrease in material &gt; 30 000 Dalton. When wastewater which had been pre-treated with the AOP was subjected to biological treatment, the wastewater showed a small colour increase of approximately l5% whereas 96% of the colour removed during enzyme treatment reverted under model aerated lagoon conditions. This finding was consistent with other studies which showed that structures reduced by the enzyme (i.e. quinones) could be oxidised back into their original form. In comparison, the colour removed by the AOP did not revert, suggesting that chromophores altered by the AOP were unable to reform. MicrotoxTM studies showed that neither the AOP activator, nor the enzyme were toxic to the receiving environment. An economic study was carried out which found that although the activator is not yet commercially available, the AOP technology could be economically feasible as long as the price of the activator was reasonable. Inventors of the activator estimate that its actual cost would be between USD 100 and 500 per kilogram. Using a worst case scenario of USD 500 per kilogram. it was estimated that if the activator was installed for the remediation of the alkaline bleach plant wastewater at the case study mill it would cost 1% of the value of the bleached pulp production, and result in a 12 % colour reduction of final wastewater. The economic study found that the enzyme treatment was not feasible (cost relative to value of production was 8%) due to the high substrate concentrations required. Overall, the study found that the AOP was a promising colour removal technology for the remediation of the alkaline bleach plant waste stream. Pilot plant trials for wastewater remediation using the AOP technology are expected to commence in the near future.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/698</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Place as Occupational Histories: Towards an Understanding of Deflated Surface Artefact Distributions in the West Darling, New South Wales, Australia</field><field name="creator">Shiner, Justin Ian</field><field name="description">This thesis develops theoretical and methodological approaches to the investigation of deflated surface stone artefact scatters beyond those that emphasise synchronic behavioural interpretations. The study is undertaken on Pine Point and Langwell Stations, two adjoining pastoral leases south of Broken Hill in arid Western New South Wales, Australia. The main objective of the study is to investigate long-term accumulated patterns in stone artefact assemblage composition within archaeological deposits with known occupational chronologies. These are derived from the dating of charcoal from heat retainer hearths. It is argued that the Pine Point-Langwell assemblages represent multiple episodes of accumulation over the last 2,000 years. Therefore, the formation of the Pine Point-Langwell assemblages means they are ideal for the investigation of long-term accumulated patterns. To analyse the composition of the Pine Point-Langwell assemblages, the concepts of artefact use life, curation, the intensity of raw material utilisation and occupation intensity are used. These permit the investigation of assemblage accumulation as a temporal process. Assemblages are not thought of as synchronic functional sets but rather as the consequence of repeated and discontinuous discard episodes overtime. As occupation intensity increases, so does the intensity of raw material utilisation. Cores and tools will be worked more intensively and assemblages will be dominated by local raw material, as access to distant sources becomes restricted. Analysis of the composition of the Pine Point-Langwell assemblages indicates both consistencies and inconsistencies in the reduction and utilisation of lithic raw materials. Some of the consistencies are argued to reflect the character and distribution of the wider lithic landscape. In general, there is a distance decay relationship in the reduction of silcrete. This relationship is not evident in all measures of reduction intensity. Variation in measures of core reduction is interpreted to reflect the variable nature of occupation through time at each of the locations in both duration and frequency. Over the time span represented in the Pine Point-Langwell occupational chronology, multiple behavioural patterns result in internal assemblage variability. Environmental variability may also contribute to the formation of variable assemblage patterns. There is evidence from south western NSW for environmental oscillation over the period represented by the occupational chronologies in the Pine Point-Langwell study area. This is interpreted as a possible impulse for the punctuated record of human occupation in the area during the last 2000 years. Hiatuses in the occupational chronology provide further evidence of the variability associated with the formation of the assemblages. Finally, notions of continuity and discontinuity in assemblage formation are explored across the wider region of Western NSW. Late Holocene assemblages from Fowlers Gap and Burkes Cave are compared to the Pine Point-Langwell assemblages. It is concluded that the approaches to reconstructing past settlement systems in the Australian arid zone are based on a fundamental misunderstanding of the formation of deflated archaeological deposits. This in turn leads to the use of inappropriate interpretive frameworks for the archaeological record. These frameworks often ignore chronology and assume both contemporaniety and consistency in behaviour through time. This denies the opportunity to investigate the diachronic aspects of deflated deposits, both in terms of occupational chronologies and discontinuities in raw material management and reduction.

There have been fewer investigations to develop a comprehensive model that includes the effects of personal and environmental variables on both action and on the development of attitudes and personality traits related to motivated behaviour. This thesis aims to integrate several such approaches within the context of a developing model of action and personality (Krampen, 1988), the Rotter tradition of social learning theory, and Bandura's more cognitive approach to motivation. In order to explore the utility of this action-theoretical model of personality a number of measures of motivation, person and environmental variables were administered to a group of Year 12 students from 4 English classes in each of 3 different schools. These measures included a new multi-dimensional locus of control instrument which incorporates a measure of self-efficacy. These data were analysed for between-group differences by school, class-within school, sex, classroom climate and locus of control cluster. A major aim was to check for interaction effects between personality and environmental measures, particularly as they impact on motivated behaviour. The environmental factors had a more powerful effect on motivated behaviour than the personality measures. In particular that aspect of classroom climate measured by the 'affiliation' scale appears to be critical in relation to motivation. Results are discnssed in terms of their contribution to the further development of the proposed interactive model, and in terms of their implications for educational practice and further research.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/776</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Personal Constructs of Organisational Identity and Identification Following Education Reform in the New Zealand Polytechnic Sector</field><field name="creator">Conroy, Denise M.</field><field name="description">Organisations face massive changes as they adapt to mergers, takeovers, downsizing or simply adding .com to their name, and all of these changes challenge the organisation's identity. Despite this understanding, little research has been done in the area of how employees react to a change in their organisation's identity, and how such a change may impact upon their own identification. The New Zealand environment represented a unique opportunity to address this gap in the literature. Local expressions of worldwide economic reform have been swift and extensive, with the commercialisation of the tertiary sector presenting a rare opportunity for exploring how change impacts upon the organisation's identity and employees' identification. From this base, the following research question was developed: How do polytechnic tutors interpret the changes to their organisation's identity and their own identification, following education reform in the New Zealand polytechnic sector? A constructivist approach was used" utilising three means of inquiry. Firstly, three separate institutes were selected, with the business school being the site of inquiry for each Case. At each site, repertory grid interviews with long-term employees were conducted to generate data at the level of the individual, and at the level of the organisation. And finally, semi-structured interviews were undertaken with senior management to provide background information on strategic direction and vision. A content analysis of both the repertory grid interviews and the semi-structured interviews provided a rigorous process of analysis. Results from this research make several contributions to our knowledge of identity and identification. The data revealed that the organisation's identity consists of a plurality of identities, with one overarching Meta Identity. Whilst other aspects of identity may change to adapt to the demands of the external environment, the Meta Identity is far more resilient, or 'sticky.' In addition to revealing the hierarchical nature of organisational identity, the data also demonstrate evidence of two paths for employees 'becoming' identified, specifically emulation and affiliation. The findings also indicate that whilst change may not create a reduction in the strength of identification, it may create a change in the need it is serving for the employee. Such changes can be detrimental to both the employee and the organisation.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/749</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Mathematical Study of Calcium Oscillations and Waves</field><field name="creator">Tsaneva-Atanasova, Krasimira Todorova</field><field name="description">In this thesis we study theoretically the dynamics of the free cytosolic Ca2+ concentration. We construct a mathematical model of the Ca2+ dynamics in pancreatic acinar cells. Although this model refers to a particular cell type, it also allows us to study some aspects of Ca2+ signalling in general. We begin by analysing the dependence of the Ca2+ oscillations on the plasma membrane transport. Further we study the propagation of intercellular Ca2+ waves in a pancreatic acinus. It has been observed experimentally that, in many cell types, calcium fluxes across the plasma membrane affect inositol trisphosphate IP3-induced calcium oscillations. Since IP3-induced calcium oscillations involve the cycling of calcium to and from the endoplasmic reticulum, it is not well understood how they can be so strongly affected by membrane fluxes. We use a mathematical model to answer this question; a model that relies on the introduction of a slow variable, the Ca2+ load of the cell. Our model predictions are confirmed by experimental results. Since similar behaviour is observed in two other models of IP3-induced Ca2+ oscillations, it is possible that this bifurcation structure is a generic feature of Ca2+ oscillation models. The effect of intercellular coupling on the oscillatory dynamics is investigated theoretically. It is demonstrated that junctional calcium diffusion can account for the co-ordination and synchronisation of cytosolic calcium oscillations in a coupled triplet of cells under the assumption of constant IP3 concentration in each individual cell. Furthermore a two dimensional version of that model, where Ca2+ and IP3 are assumed to diffuse within as well as between the cells, has been studied numerically. Compared to the results from the analysis of the ODE model, the results from the analysis of the PDE model (in two spatial dimensions) reveal some interesting spatial effects of the diffusion, and of the geometry of the cells on the collective oscillatory behaviour of the systen. Based on this combined approach, a suggestion about the specific role of both Ca2+ and IP3 in the intercellular Ca2+ signalling has been made.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/606</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Organosilanes: Synthesis and Reactivity Directed Towards Annulations</field><field name="creator">Harris, Paul William Richard</field><field name="description">Ruthenium-catalysed coupling of alkenes (principally vinylsilanes) with the ortho C-H bond of a wide range of monocyclic, bicyclic and tricyclic aromatic ketones led to a high yield of ortho-alkylated adducts. A methoxy substituent located para to the directing carbonyl moiety had an activating effect while an ortho methoxy resulted in severe inhibition of the coupling reaction and methoxy cleavage was observed. However, an ortho TBDMS ether allowed the C-H/olefin coupling to proceed quantitatively, which was attributed to inhibition of catalyst quenching by preventing chelate formation. With a view to cyclopentaannulation, the adducts from the C-H/olefin coupling containing a ArCH2CH2SiMe3 side chain were functionalised by radical bromination leading to a 1,2-dibromo compound which was converted into a COCH3 by elimination and hydrolysis. An analogous sequence, when applied to a more complex substrate, gave products resulting from bromination and/or elimination at a different benzylic site. Attempted intramolecular aldol reactions of a 1,4-dicarbonyl compound failed and resulted instead in skeletal rearrangement. The carbon-silicon bond in ArCH2CH2SiMe3 could be converted into a silanol (RSiMe2OH) when treated with aluminium chloride, but attempts to oxidise the C-Si bond (to give an alcohol) in this compound were unsuccessful. Silicon-carbon bond oxidation in adducts containing a ArCH2CH2Si(OR)xMey side chain gave an ArCH2CH2OH fragment provided that a proximal ketone was converted to an alcohol prior to the oxidation to avoid unwanted Baeyer-Villiger reaction. The resultant 1,5-diols could not be oxidised directly to a 1,5-dicarbonyl compound, but were converted into a mono alcohol by ionic hydrogenation and subsequent deprotection in excellent overall yield. Successive benzylic and primary alcohol oxidation provided the required 1,5-dicarbonyl functionality, but this enone aldehyde was not suitable for cyclopentaannulation. Attempts to synthesise an alternative substrate (a keto aldehyde) via protection of the primary alcohol followed by benzylic oxidation were unsuccessful, but could be achieved by conjugate reduction of the enone. The ensuing pinacol coupling failed. The quassinoid ring system was accessed by functional group interconversion to yield a &#948;-keto ester, which underwent latonisation using SmI2. Coupling of alkynylsilanes with the ortho C-H bond of various aromatic ketones proceeded in high yield under ruthenium catalysis and resulted in the introduction of a vinyl group predominantly of E configuration. In contrast, the aromatic ketone 1-acetylnaphthalene, underwent cyclopentaannulation in a one-pot sequence under analogous conditions, which was confirmed by X-ray crystallographic analysis. This was proposed to occur via &#946;-silyl migration as a key step. Attempts to synthesise an alkynylsilane bearing alkoxy substituents failed and gave only a dialkyne, which underwent ruthenium-mediated C-H bond insertion cleanly. The resultant alkenylalkynylsilanes could not be oxidised to an aldehyde. Trimethyl orthoformate-promoted intramolecular cyclisation of the ortho vinylated aromatic ketones resulted in cyclopentaannulation in high yield. The newly formed 5-membered ring was confirmed by an X-ray structure of a diterpenoid analogue. Mono or tricyclic substrates produced benzofulvenes in high yield when the ketone was exocyclic, while a naphthalene derivative resulted in the isolation of methanol adducts. A diterpenoid containing a dihydrofuranyl ring could be synthesised via intramolecular Hg(II) cyclisation of an alcohol and a proximal alkene.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/699</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Partial Oxidation of Methanol to Formaldehyde Over an Electrolytic Silver Catalyst</field><field name="creator">Waterhouse, Geoffrey Ivan Neil</field><field name="description">The partial oxidation of methanol to formaldehyde over an electrolytic silver catalyst is a large-scale industrial process that provides the feedstock for the manufacture of synthetic resins, plastics and important chemical intermediates such as 1,4-butanediol and methylene diphenyl diisocyanate (MDI). The process is carried out at atmospheric pressure by passing CH3OH vapour, in the presence of air and steam, through a thin bed of electrolytic silver catalyst operating adiabatically at temperatures between 873-973 K. Process yields of CH2O may be as high as 88-90 %. Competing reactions lead to the formation of CO2, HCOOH and CO. The objective of this thesis was to gain a better understanding of the reaction mechanism and those factors which influence silver catalyst activity and selectivity to CH2O during CH3OH oxidation. Through the application of a variety of experimental techniques it is shown that the dissociative chemisorption of 02 activates electrolytic silver catalysts for CH3OH oxidation. Over the temperature range 448-1073 K, the oxygen inventory of silver catalysts comprises three distinct atomic oxygen species: two surface species (denote O&#945; and O&#947;) and a bulk-dissolved species (O&#946;). The surface species are distinguishable by their Ag-O bonding, thermal stability and reactivity differences. O&#945; is formed by the dissociative chemisorption of O2 on Ag(110) or Ag(111) planes. The species is weakly bound, possesses bridging Ag-O-Ag bonding and strong nucleophilic character, and opens reaction pathways towards CH2O, CO2 and HCOOH. Recombinative desorption of O&#945; as O2 commences at temperatures above 580 K. O&#947; formation occurs exclusively on reconstructed Ag(111) planes. The species possesses a highly covalent Ag=O bonding interaction and exists to temperatures in excess of 923 K in the presence of gas phase O2. O&#947; activates silver catalysts for the oxidative-dehydrogenation of CH3OH to CH2O + H2O, but shows no selectivity towards CO2 or HCOOH production. Bulk-dissolved oxygen (O&#946;) exchanges reversibly with the O&#945; and O&#947; species. The product distribution of CH3OH oxidation over electrolytic silver catalysts is controlled by the relative surface populations of the O&#945; and O&#947; states. Formaldehyde selectivity and yield increase with temperature up to 923 K, CH3OH/O2 feed ratio from 1.5-2.25 and catalyst grain boundary density, all of which reflect a corresponding increase in the surface O&#947; / O&#945; ratio on the catalysts. An optimum formaldehyde yield of 84.3 % was obtained during testing of the silver catalysts, under conditions close to those employed industrially (temperature = 923 K, molar feed composition CH3OH/O2/H2O/He = 2.25/1/1.7/20, GHSV = 1.25x105 h-1). Above 923 K, yields decreased due to the homogeneous decomposition of CH2O to CO + H2. Pronounced thermal and catalytic etching of the silver catalyst occurred during activation under conditions of industrial CH2O synthesis. Critically, structures created by these processes promote O&#946; and O&#947; formation, and improve catalyst performance. Results were used to develop comprehensive reaction schemes for CH3OH oxidation over electrolyic silver catalysts. The thermal decomposition of Ag1Ag111O2 in air was examined in relation to the industrial practice of adding silver oxides to silver catalyst beds to facilitate 'light off' during start up operations. Ag1AglllO2 was thermally reduced to metallic silver via two non-reversible steps, with the intermediate formation of Ag2O. The transformation of Ag1Ag111O2 to Ag2O occurred with heating in the 373-473 K region, while the product of this reaction remained stable to temperatures in excess of 623 K. Complete thermal decomposition of the Ag2O intermediate to Ag and O2 occurred at673 K. The oxidation of several silver substrates by reaction with ozone (5 mol % O3 in 02) was examined as potential route to the production of silver catalysts of high initial activity towards CH3OH oxidation. At 300 K, the Ag substrates were oxidised by O3 to yield Ag2O and monoclinic Ag1Ag111O2. The Ag1Ag111O2, formed at the gas/oxide interface, via the oxidation of Ag2O.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/700</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reciprocal Teaching as a School-Wide Inclusive Strategy</field><field name="creator">Westera, Wilhelmina Julia</field><field name="description">Informed selection, development and implementation of inclusive teaching practices are critical with the move towards more inclusive education evident in recent major policy changes in New Zealand. In this thesis, guiding questions for validating inclusive teaching practices were extended to include a school-wide approach. These questions guided a review of the literature on reciprocal teaching (RT), a metacognitive method for teaching reading comprehension, to examine its potential as an inclusive method. They were also used to examine the findings from two implementation studies using RT within inclusive and culturally diverse urban classrooms in a school-wide approach. In the high school study, RT was introduced after a systemic analysis showed the need for a school-wide approach to pervasive reading comprehension problems. In a collaborative effort between departments, English, social studies and learning support teachers were supported in incorporating RT into the regular curriculum and timetable. Four classroom teachers with two support teachers were trained and ran eight RT groups for the lowest reading comprehenders within seven classrooms. In the primary school study, RT was incorporated into four Year 4 and 5 inclusive classrooms at syndicate level. Half of each class (Group One) was matched on reading comprehension (high, medium, and low) and in prior experience of RT, with the other half of each class (Group Two). Group One completed the intervention in the first part of the year, whilst Group Two formed a no treatment comparison condition. Group Two completed the intervention in the second part of the year. In both studies, teachers and teacher aides were trained and supported into the use of the new procedure, including in-class observations, feedback and regular discussions during intervention. In the primary school study, specific adaptations to the RT method were also made by read aloud, tape-assisted, and prior repeated practice methods, for students new to the English language, and those with special needs. Statistically significant gains on reading comprehension scores were observed with the 20 high school students who received an extended RT programme (with 12 to 16 sessions), whereas no significant differences were observed with 26 students in the short programme (6 to 8 sessions) and control groups. Follow-up assessments of extended programme students showed maintenance of comprehension gains. This study highlighted the need to introduce preventative and inclusive metacognitive instruction methods not only at high school, but also earlier. With intervention in the primary school study, low comprehenders (n=41), including those who had prior experience with RT, made practically significant gains not only on reading comprehension, but also on decoding. Further, all students (n=103) made significant gains on a measure of metacognitive awareness of reading strategies, but not on measures of reading comprehension and reading attitudes. Analysis of data on programme adherence showed that students had high participation rates and regular use of all four cognitive strategies throughout the intervention. In terms of programme adherence by instructors during the group dialogue, there was an appropriate focus on idea rather than word level, but scaffolding was only partially evident. Teacher feedback in both studies supported the feasibility of the method for regular teachers working together with support staff during the introductory phase. The high school study also showed that this arrangement can work for several years, and that RT will be effective - if students are provided with more than 12 sessions, and if adequately sustained at a class teacher and school-wide level. Both studies contribute to our understanding of the potential of RT as an inclusive instructional procedure, illustrating that RT can be incorporated at a school-wide level as a means of early intervention to address widespread reading problems and facilitate more inclusive practises between regular teachers and special needs staff. Implications are also discussed in terms of strategic resourcing for remediation, value for staff development in inclusive methods, and school commitment to sustaining inclusive and early intervention within a school-wide approach.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/767</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Groundwater Regime of the Waihi Basin, North Island, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Ling, Lim</field><field name="description">The study seeks to understand the complex groundwater systems within Waihi Basin (Coromandel Area, North Island, New Zealand), a river basin covering c.140km2 which is drained by a single river, the Ohinemuri River. These groundwater systems are hosted by rather shallow, fracture ignimbrite aquifers and deeper andesite rocks infilling the basin down to depths of c.2km. All groundwaters are found to mix freely with infiltrating meteoric water throughout the whole basin. Because of the favourable river basin setting, all existing meteorological and hydrological data collected during 1992 to 1996 were analysed in terms of the mass balance components. Incomplete data sets only allowed the assessment of the three major components for the year 1994, namely total precipitation (0.22km3/yr), total evapotranspiration (0.1lkm3/yr) and total stream discharge (0.13 km3/yr). The ratio of these major components in the other years appears to be similar. Other smaller components in the mass balance were assessed by numerical modeling. For this, the whole basin was subdivided into numerous blocks and three layers with the intersection of the blocks reflecting gross tectonic structures. The observed piezometric levels of the groundwater wells intersecting the two top layers were used as matching parameters retaining infiltration (recharge) as an unknown parameter. The best fit numerical models points to a rather small annual recharge of the groundwater in the basin amounting to c.l% of the volume of the total annual precipitation (0.002km3/yr). The best fit basin model also predicts a somewhat smaller stream discharge (0.1Okm3/yr) than that observed. The difference can be interpreted in terms of change in storage and a discrepancy factor which might reflect the uncertainty in the observed total stream discharge. There is no evidence for any significant in- or outflow beneath the catchment boundaries. Most waters from groundwater wells in the Waihi Basin exhibit a very low mineralisation as shown by their average value of total dissolved solids (TDS) of c.110mg/kg. Significantly higher values (&gt;3,000mg/kg) occur only within and around the workings of the old Waihi Mine. The waters with low mineralisation can be classified as sodium-bicarbonate waters of low ionic strength. Despite the low strength, their cation ratios are controlled by fluid-rock interactions which fingerprint different types of volcanic host rocks (i.e. rhyolite, ignimbrite, andesite) and traces of distinct alteration minerals (i.e. kaolinite, montmorillonite, illite). The geochemical constituents in the groundwater vary throughout the year with silica sodium and TDS showing the smallest changes. Their concentration patterns across the whole basin points to the occurrence of slightly higher mineralized, dilute thermal waters in the axial and central part of the basin which discharge in a few wells as artesian flow with slightly elevated (a few degrees only) temperatures. Using a 2-D numerical simulation model, derived in part from the earlier numerical basin model, the associated advective flow of slightly heated deeper groundwater could be modelled using the near-surface discharge temperatures of artesian wells and their location as a matching parameter. It was found that a deep terrestrial heat flow of c.90mW/m2 is required to initiate convection and advective flow. This points to a deep basin temperature of c.118 degrees C at 2km depth. The best fit model points to a discharge centre not only in the basin centre but also to a smaller one lying outside the SE-basin divide. The probable sources for the anomalous terrestrial heat flow are most likely related to paleo-subduction and associated paleo-volcanic processes. The numerical models simulating the groundwater flow in the Waihi Basin also allow an assessment of the local groundwater anomaly caused by the pumping and dewatering of the Waihi open cast which started in 1990. The decline in waterlevel in the centre of the open pit in the old No.7 shaft was used as matching parameter in modelling the local groundwater flow around the mine. The actual pumping rates were poorly known and were treated as an unknown parameter. The best fit model provides extreme values for the pumping rates in 1997 with a mean of 60 &#177; 30 kg/s; this agrees with the actual mean annual pumping rates of c.55 kg/s for 1997 and allows the prediction that the deep piezometric level within the andesites around the mine has been depressed to mean sea level and affects an area within a radius of at least 0.5km around the centre of the open cast mine. The average hydraulic conductivities of the rocks within and beneath the cone of depression are also one order of magnitude lower than conductivities in adjacent blocks reflecting presumably the accumulated effects of older and present day blasting activities. The study has shown that detailed simulation of groundwater flow is required to understand the actual flow regimen of a groundwater basin even in an ideal setting such as the Waihi river basin.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/777</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Educating About Asia in New Zealand Secondary Schools in The 1990s Contesting Policy Curriculum and Practice</field><field name="creator">Pang, David Nui-Nyen</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/641</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Roles for Cation-Chloride Cotransporters in Maintenance of Lens Volume &amp; Transparency</field><field name="creator">Chee, Kaa-Sandra Nardia</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/830</field></doc><doc><field name="title">On the Borders of Consciousness</field><field name="creator">Fairhall, Scott Laurence</field><field name="description">The neural mechanism by which the brain creates conscious awareness remains unknown. The present thesis employs electroencephalography to investigate these neural substrates of conscious awareness through an investigation of the distinctions between neural activity associated with conscious awareness and neural activity which is not accompanied by conscious awareness. The temporal dynamics and the complexity of content during the unconscious processing of information are assessed in the first two chapters using the masked presentation of word stimuli. Results reveal that abstract information is extracted from unconsciously presented stimuli more rapidly than is usually associated with the neural indices of the conscious representation of information. It is also shown that the delay between the processing of different elements of word stimuli is such that some form of stable reentrancy is likely established during unconscious neural activity. The third experiment investigate the oscillatory event related beta desynchrony (ERD) preceding movement with and without awareness of the impending movement. The results show that beta ERD, unlike the evoked EEG response, reflects the awareness of the intention to move. It is argued that beta ERD allows the establishment of reverberating neural assemblies that are thought to be necessary for conscious representation. The final experiment uses a binocular rivalry paradigm to investigate the role of synchronous oscillations in determining the contents of consciousness. It is argued on the basis of this chapter that synchrony reflects the reorganisation and coordination of neural activity but is not, in itself, a mechanism for the binding of neural assemblies. The results are  discussed in relationship to the distinction between conscious and unconscious cognition existing across a spectrum rather than representing qualitatively different neural states.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/613</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Confronting Barriers to Ecological Information Transfer in New Zealand's Fisheries Management System: Towards Developing a Trajectory for Trans-disciplinary Inquiry</field><field name="creator">Massey, Edwin John</field><field name="description">Confronting Barriers to Ecological Information Transfer in New Zealand's Fisheries Management system: Towards Developing a Trajectory for Trans-disciplinary Inquiry This thesis confronts barriers to ecological information transfer in New Zealand's fisheries management system. The investigation reveals a wider problematic within the governmental institutions of the fisheries milieu. The thesis deploys Callon's (1991) concept of translation to ask new questions regarding the conduct of fisheries science and management, which since the introduction of the Quota Management System in 1986, has been defined through the practices of commercial stakeholder groups. These stakeholders enrol ecological information through a narrowly defined and non-reflexive discourse of sustainable utilisation to serve specific purposes that suit their own needs. The thesis uses imaginaries to illustrate how sustainable utilisation has marginalised those stakeholders with different views on how ecological information could be used in fisheries management decision making. Moreover, the thesis contends that the milieu's hegemonic ontological environment prevents translation by mitigating the potential for dialogue between stakeholder groups. The thesis engages with a wide range of literature and cuts through established modes of thinking, developing a trans-disciplinary discourse that re-conceptualises the fisheries management problematic in process terms. The thesis demonstrates how trans-disciplinary dialogue that might transcend the current impasses in the New Zealand fisheries milieu will only develop through a network of previously unconnected groups. The thesis proposes a series of policy and behavioural interventions aimed at shifting the existing hierarchies of power and realigning established networks to ensure such dialogue is possible.

Pulsed electric field (PEF) is an emerging technology for non thermal food pasteurisation. Using this technology, enzymes, pathogenic and spoilage microorganisms can be inactivated without affecting the colour, flavour, and nutrients of the food. PEF treatment may be provided by applying pulsed electric field to a food product in a treatment zone between two electrodes at ambient , or slightly above ambient temperature. Exposure of microbial cells to the electric field induces a transmembrane potential in the cell membrane, which results in electroporation (the permeabilization of the membranes of cells and organelles) and/or electrofusion (the connection of two separate membranes into one) of the cells. An innovative pulsed electric field (PEF) unit was designed and constructed in the University of Auckland using modern IGBT technology. The system consists of main equipments, the high voltage pulse generator and the treatment chambers.  The main focus of this work was to design an innovative PEF treatment chamber that provide uniform distribution of electric field, minimum increase in liquid temperature, minimum fouling of electrodes and an energy efficient system. Four multi pass treatment chambers were designed consisting of two stainless steel mesh electrodes in each chamber, with the treated fluid flowing through the openings of the mesh electrodes. The two electrodes are electrically isolated from each other by an insulator element designed to form a small orifice where most of the electric field is concentrated. Dielectric breakdown inside the chambers was prevented by removing the electrodes far from the narrow gap. The effect of the chambers different geometries on the PEF process in terms of electric parameters and microbial inactivation were investigated. Electric field intensity in the range of (17-43 kV/cm) was applied with square bipolar pulses of 1.7 &#181;s duration. The effect of PEF treatment on the inactivation of gram-negative Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 suspended in simulated milk ultra-filtrate (SMUF) of 100%, 66.67% and 50% concentration was investigated. Treatments with the same electrical power input but higher electric field strengths provided larger degree of killing. The inactivation rate of E coli was significantly increased with increasing the electric field strength, treatment time and processing temperature. Morphological changes on E coli as a result of PEF treatment were studied under transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Significant morphological changes on E coli after PEF treatment were observed. The TEM studies suggested that the microbial inactivation was a consequence of electroporation and electrofusion mechanisms. Kinetic analysis of microbial inactivation due to PEF and thermal treatment of E coli suspended in SUMF were also studied. Comparison between measured (experimental) and predicted (theoretical) variation of E coli concentration with time following the PEF treatment was discussed, taking into consideration the recirculation mode of the PEF treatment. The treated liquid was circulated more than once through the treatment chamber to provide higher microbial inactivation. Arrhenius constants and activation energies of E coli inactivation using combined PEF and thermal treatment were calculated and generalized correlation for the inactivation rate constant as a function of electric field intensity and treatment temperature was developed.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Non thermal pasteurisation</field><field name="subject">Pulsed electric field</field><field name="subject">New treatment chamber design</field><field name="subject">Microbial inactivation</field><field name="subject">E coli ATCC 25922</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/543</field></doc><doc><field name="title">High Valent Early Transition Metal Complexes as Catalysts for Organic Transformations</field><field name="creator">Glenny, Mark W.</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/651</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Manipulation of Dietary Fatty Acids and Soluble Fibre: Controlled Intervention Trials Investigating Cardiovascular and Type 2 Diabetes Risk</field><field name="creator">Keogh, Geraldine F.</field><field name="description">Cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes mellitus are two of the leading causes of death in developed countries and the prevalence of these integrally linked disease states continues to grow. A number of modifiable risk factors contribute to the development of cardiovascular disease including raised blood cholesterol, hypertension and obesity, the latter also being an important modifiable risk for type 2 diabetes mellitus. Diet is also a critical factor underpinning the development and progression of these adult-onset diseases, however the complete role of diet in modifying risk has not yet been fully ascertained. This thesis describes a series of randomised, controlled cross-over intervention trials that have investigated the potentially beneficial effects of alterations in the macronutrient composition of the diet, specifically lipid and carbohydrate composition, in relation to both cardiovascular and type2 diabetes risk. Trial 1 investigated whether modifying the fatty acid profile of a bovine butter-fat, using simple feeding methods to substitute a moderate proportion of the saturated fatty acids with mono- and polyunsaturated fatty acids, could improve blood lipid profile and haemostatic clotting factors in 20 healthy men following a tightly controlled dietary regimen in which butter-fat was incorporated into a typical Western diet. Results showed that the inclusion of the modified butterfat led to a clinically significant reduction in serum total (P &lt; 0.05) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (P &lt; 0.01) without a concomitant reduction in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. The 7% decrease in serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, achieved with only a small alteration in the fatty acid composition of the total diet, would represent a significant reduction in cardiovascular risk if applied across a whole population. The sub-study of Trial 1 investigated changes in erythrocyte membrane fatty acid composition during a period of controlled fat feeding in order to assess whether dietary change could alter membrane fatty acid composition over a 3 week period, and hence determine whether it may be a useful short-term biomarker of dietary compliance. The results showed some significant changes in erythrocyte membrane saturated, mono- and polyunsaturated fatty acids within 3 weeks following alterations in dietary fatty acid composition. All fatty acids changed in parallel with diet but in this group of 20 men only C18:0 and C18:1 had altered significantly (P &lt; 0.05) by 3 weeks. The results of this trial suggest that the measurement of erythrocyte membrane fatty acid composition may be a valuable, independent, qualitative measure of dietary compliance in short-term intervention trials that currently rely on self-reported intake data, however they can provide no quantitative information. Trial 2 assessed postprandial metabolic outcomes associated with cardiovascular risk, including triacylglycerol, triacylglycerol-rich lipoproteins, cholesterol-rich lipoproteins, haemostatic clotting factors, glucose, insulin and amylin, using the high saturate and high mono- and polyunsaturated fatty acid butter-fat as the fat challenge. The study, carried out in 18 healthy men, showed a significant increase in plasma triacylglycerol in the 3 hours immediately following ingestion of the high mono- and polyunsaturated fat feeding compared with the high saturated fat (P &lt; 0.05). No other differential effects were observed. When both treatment groups were combined the total lipaemia induced by an acute fat bolus caused a delayed and prolonged increase in serum cholesterol and cholesterol-rich lipoproteins, confirming evidence from previous trials that fatty meals may cause cholesterol to be elevated for many hours postprandially and thereby confounding measures taken in the fasted state. Trial 3 investigated the effects of adding a highly enriched barley-derived &#946;-glucan (75% w/w) into a typical Western diet, in 18 'at risk' hypercholesterolaemic men following a highly controlled dietary protocol. The addition of lOg/day &#946;-glucan to the diet failed to demonstrate significant improvements in lipid or glucose control, and hence no evidence of improvement in cardiovascular disease or type 2 diabetes mellitus risk. The inability to reduce serum cholesterol may have been a consequence of structural changes that occurred during the enrichment process converting the natural barley cereal into a high &#946;-glucan product, as has been shown during similar enrichment processes of oat &#946;-glucan. These trials have demonstrated that under strictly controlled experimental conditions changes in the fatty acid composition of the diet can lead to improvement in cardiovascular disease risk, as measured by alterations in serum lipids, over a 3 week period. However, beneficial changes in postprandial markers of cardiovascular disease were not observed, nor were markers of type 2 diabetes risk in this group of individuals with normal lipid and glucose metabolism. The measurement of erythrocyte membrane fatty acid composition identified some potentially useful biomarkers of dietary compliance that may be useful in short-term trials. The dietary fibre manipulation described did not result in any significant improvements in cardiovascular disease or type 2 diabetes risk factors and raised important issues regarding the physiological activity of highly processed soluble fibre products, and highlighted the fact that not all &#946;-glucan products have beneficial cholesterol-lowering properties.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/690</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Methods of Direct Image Transmission</field><field name="creator">Somervell, Andrew Robert Donald</field><field name="description">Two interesting new methods for direct image transmission via optical communication channels are presented. In the first of these, the images are transmitted via a serial optical link using phase only encoding and decoding of the image. This is achieved by encoding the image using a set of binary phase sequences and sending the sum of the field from all the pixels through the link. The image is reconstructed by first spatially separating the beam into output pixels and impressing phase sequences conjugate to those used to encode the image onto each pixel. Then the output pixels are combined with a coherent reference beam and the resulting intensities are averaged over the length of the sequences to recover the image. This method is discussed theoretically and it is shown that the number of image pixels able to be transmitted is limited by the dynamic range of the system. An experiment performed to demonstrate the principle of this technique is presented. This is done by transmitting a sixteen pixel image using a liquid crystal spatial light modulator to impart the phase sequences. Reasonably good image transmission is observed. In the second image transmission technique the image is sent directly through a multimode optical waveguide. In this method the amplitudes of the waveguide modes are matched to those of the image pixels by sampling the image correctly and performing an appropriate transform. At the output, the waveguide modes are spatially separated into discrete pixels with amplitudes proportional to those of the original image pixels. This is done by performing another transform and sampling appropriately. Image transmission through a perfectly reflecting slab waveguide and a dielectric slab waveguide is discussed theoretically. Experiments which demonstrate image transmission using this technique and highlight the difficulties encountered are also presented.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/691</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Nonmetrisable Manifolds</field><field name="creator">Greenwood, Sina Ruth</field><field name="description">Nyikos has defined a tree, denoted T, associated with any given Type I space. This thesis examines the properties of an T-tree if the space is a Type I nonmetrisable manifold. It is shown that a tree, T, is an T-tree of a Type I manifold iff T is a well-pruned &#969;1-tree. Furthermore, if T is any well-pruned &#969;1-tree, there are 2N1 different Type I manifolds for which T is the T-tree. The relationships between the properties of a Type I manifold and the properties of its T-tree are examined. It is shown that whenever a Type I manifold contains a copy of &#969;1, its T-tree must contain an uncountable branch. The thesis then addresses the problem of whether or not an arbitrary tree T admits a Type I manifold which is &#969;1-compact. If T does not contain an uncountable antichain, or a Suslin subtree, then there exists a Type I manifold with T-tree T. If T contains an uncountable antichain, then whether there exists an &#969;1-compact Type I manifold with T-tree T is undecidable. (*) implies there does not exist such a tree while &#9674; implies that there does. If we assume &#9827;+, then at least one such manifold exists. &#9674; also implies that if T contains a Suslin subtree, then there exists an &#969;1-compact manifold with T-tree T. Nyikos has recently defined a Type II space. We may associate an T-tree with such a space. This thesis shows that a Tree, T, admits a Type II manifold iff T has height not greater than &#969;1, and each level has cardinality no greater than c. The final chapter examines the relationship between microbundles and fibre bundles over nonmetrisable manifolds. In 1964 Milnor defined the notion of a microbunble. He ceased developing the theory of microbundles when later in the same year Kister showed that a microbundle over a metrisable manifold is equivalent to a fibre bundle. This thesis proves that the tangent microbundle over a manifold is a fibre bundle iff the manifold is metrisable. As a consequence of this we obtain further properties equivalent to metrisability in a manifold.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/697</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sulfur Compounds in the Environment</field><field name="creator">Li, Kwong Chi</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/770</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies of osmium and ruthenium complexes with ligands featuring group 14 and 15 donor atoms</field><field name="creator">Woodgate, Scott Darren</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the preparation and chemistry of osmium and ruthenium complexes with ligands featuring the group 14 donor atoms carbon and silicon, and the group l5 donor atom phosphorus. Aryl, alkenyl, and alkynyl complexes of osmium and ruthenium, prepared via mercury reagents, are discussed in Chapter One. 5-Coordinate 2-halophenyl complexes M(C6H4X-2)CI(CE)(PPh3)2 (M = Os; X = C1, Br; E = O, S; M = Os; X = I E = O; M = Ru; X = CI, Br, E = O) were synthesised by reaction of organomercury reagents Hg(C6H4X-2)2 (X = C1, I, Br) with MHC1(CO)(PPh3)3: (M = Os, Ru). Os(C6H4X-2)C1(CO)(PPh3)2 (M = Os; X = C1, I, Br) were characterised structurally and the interaction between X and M examined. Attempted benzyne syntheses using these complexes were not successful. 6-Coordinate complexes M(C6H4X-2)C1(CO)(CE)(PPh3)2 (M = Os, X = C1, E = O, S; Br, E = O, S; M = Os, E = O, X = I; M = Ru, E = O, X = C1, Br) were prepared by the addition of carbon monoxide to the corresponding 5-coordinate precursors. Approaches towards reduction of these complexes are discussed. The structure of Os(C6H4C1-2)C1(CS)(CO)(PPh3)2 revealed that the thiocarbonyl and the aryl halide ligands were cis and therefore in an ideal geometry to rearrange and form a substituted thioacyl ligand. Indeed, on heating Os(C6H4X-2)C1(CS)(CO)(PPh3)2 (X = C1, Br) the corresponding thioacyl complexes Os(&#951;2-CS{C6H4X-2})C1(CO)(PPh3)2 (X = C1, Br) were formed. The decreased electron density in the halo aryl rings of these thioacyl complexes, combined with the fact that the halide substituents were no longer bonded to the metal, enabled facile lithiation of the aryl rings, even at low temperature. Quenching the appropriate lithiated intermediate with Bu3SnC1 gave Os(&#951;2-CS{C6H4SnBu3-2})C1(CO)(PPh3)2. These results suggested that M(C6H4{CH2X}-2)C1(CO)(PPh3)2 (M = Os, Ru) were worthwhile target complexes for lithiation studies. To this end, Hg(C6H4{CH2OH}-2)C1 was prepared but attempts to convert the alcohol into a tosylate (for subsequent reaction with LiX) were unsuccessful and so this chemistry was not pursued further. Hg(C6H4{CH2OH}-2)C1 transferred the benzylic alcohol groups to osmium and ruthenium, albeit in low yields. Oxidation of Hg(C6H4{CH2OH}-2)C1 with PCC provided the benzaldehyde-containing mercury complex Hg(C6H4{CHO}-2)C1, symmetrization of which gave Hg(C6H4{CHO}-2)2. The latter compound was used to prepare aldehyde complexes of osmium and ruthenium, as well as mercury(II) benzaldoxime and benzaldimines. The aldehyde oxygen atoms in the osmium and ruthenium complexes were bound to the metals and were unaffected by amines, and by attempts to displace them from the metals. The addition of dimethyldithiocarbamate to Ru(C6H4{CHO}-2)C1(CO)(PPh3)2 displaced a triphenylphosphine ligand and Ru(C6H4{CHO}-2)(CO)({CH3}2NCS2)(PPh3) was formed. Transfer of the benzaldoxime ligand, and various benzaldimine ligands [C6H4{C[H]=NR] R = Me, CH2CH2NEt2, CH2CH2NMe2], to osmium or ruthenium gave M(C6H4{C[H]=NR}-2)C1(CO)(PPh3)2 (M = Ru, R = OH; M = Os, Ru; R = Me, CH2CH2NEt2;M= Ru, R = CH2CH2NMe2). The derived cationic complexes Ru(C6H4{C[H]=NCH2CH2NHR2}-2)C1(CO)(PPh3)2]BF4 (R - Me, Et) were prepared by protonation of the benzaldimine complexes with HBF4+ and Ru(C6H4{C[H]=NCH2CH2NR2}-2)(Co)(PPh3)2]BF4(R = Me, Et)were prepared by addition of AgBF4. Bromination of Ru(C6H4{C[H]=NMe}-2)C1(Co)(PPh3)2 gave Ru(C6H3{C[H]=NMe}-2, Br-4)C1(Co)(PPh3)2 which was lithiated at low temperature. The aryllithium was quenched with Bu3SnC1 to give Ru(C6H3 { C[H]=NMe}-2,SnBu3-4)C1(CO)(PPh3)2. The reaction of alkynylmercury reagents with osmium and ruthenium complexes are discussed in the following sections. Treatment of RuHCI(CO)(PPh3)2 with Hg(C&#8801;CPh)2 has been reported previously, the result being formation of an &#945;-phenylethynyl-trans-&#946;-styryl ligand. However, the corresponding reaction with OsHCI(CO)(PPh3)3 resulted in catalysed coupling of the alkyne. This reaction was re-examined and the 6-coordinate &#945;-phenylethynyl-trans-&#946;-styryl osmium complex was prepared by direct reaction of the 5-coordinate complex with acetate ion. A dicarbonyl complex containing the &#945;-phenylethynyl-trans-&#946;-styryl ligand, Os(C{C&#8801;Ph}=CHPh)CI(CO)2(PPh3)2, was prepared by the addition of carbon monoxide in the presence of LiC1 to the acetate complex. Thiocarbonyl complexes containing an &#945;-phenylethynyl-trans-&#946;-styryl ligand were prepared. Addition of carbon monoxide to solutions containing these complexes gave the thioacyl analogues M(&#951;2-CS{C[C&#8801;CPh]=CHPh})C1(CO)(PPh3)2 (M = Os, Ru). The remaining sections in Chapter One examine the reactions of mercury(II) reagents with the osmium(O) complexes Os(CO)2(PPh3)3 and OsCI(NO)(PPh3)3. Oxidative addition of the mercury-carbon bond of HgR2 (R = C6H4CH34, C&#8801;CPh, trans-CH=CHPh) to Os(CO)2(PPh3)3 gave OsR(HgR)(CO)2(PPh3)2. Reaction of the acetylide or styryl complexes with iodine resulted in cleavage of the osmium-mercury bond and yielded either Os(C&#8801;CPh)I(CO)2(PPh3)2 or Os(trans-CH=CHPh)I(CO)2(PPh3)2. Similar complexes were not accessible from reaction of the osmium(II) complex OsHC1(CO)(PPh3)3 with the appropriate mercury reagent. Whereas the mercury reagents reacted with Os(CO)2(PPh3)3 to give the simple oxidative addition products, the corresponding reactions of OsC1(NO)(PPh3)3 with HgR2 did not always give the analogous products OsR(HgR)C1(NO)(PPh3)2. Addition of Hg(C6H4CH3-4)2 to OsC1(NO)(PPh3)3 gave a mixture of the bis(p-tolyl) complex Os(C6H4CH3-4)2C1(NO)(PPh3)2 and the mono(p-tolyl) complex Os(C6H4CH3-4)CI2(NO)(PPh3)2. The structure of the bis(p-tolyl) complex revealed that the p-tolyl ligands were trans and the metal-carbon(aryl) bond lengths were extremely long. Addition of pyridine to the bis(p-tolyl) complex gave Os(C6H4CH3-4)2(C5H5N)CI(NO)(PPh3), which contained two cis p-tolyl ligands. The reactions of Hg(C6H4C1-2)2 and Hg(C&#8801;CPh)Ph with OsCI(NO)(PPh3)3 gave complexes containing a single organic ligand. In contrast, treatment of OsCI(NO)(PPh3)3 with either Hg({C4H4S-2})2 or Hg([C4H4SMe-5]-2})2 gave the dithienyl complexes OsR2CI(NO)(PPh3)2 [R = (C4H4S)-2, ({C4H4SMe-5})-2. Furthermore, the reaction of Hg(CF3)2 with OsC1(NO)(PPh3)3 gave Os(CF3)(Hg{CF3})CI(NO)(PPh3)2. Treatment of OsCI(NO)(PPh3)3 with Hg(trans-CH=CHPh)2 gave Os(trans-CH=CHPh)CI2(NO)(PPh3)2 and an osmaindene complex, Os(C6H4CH=CH)H(NO)(PPh3)2, which in turn gave Os(C6H4CH=CH)Cl(No)(PPh3)2 on treatment with HCl. Chapter Two examines osmabenzene chemistry. Spectroscopic data were collected for the known complexes Os(&#951;2-C[S]CH=CHCH=CH)(CO)(PPh3)2, and Os(C[SH]CH=CHCH=CH)(cis-CI)(CO)(PPh3)2. Oxidation of the osmabenzene thiol to a sulfinic acid was attempted. Methylation of the parent complex, Os(&#951;2-C[S]CH=CHCH=CH)(CO)(PPh3)2, gave the product of kinetic control as Os(C[SMe]CH=CHCH=CH)(cis-I)(CO)(PPh3)2, reported previously, which rearranged on heating to give the trans isomer, Os(C[SMe]CH=CHCH=CH)(trans-I)(CO)(PPh3)2. Approaches to auration of the sulphur in Os(&#951;2-C[S]CH=CHCH=CH)(CO)(PPh3)2, are described. Although the metallabenzenes reported previously have physical properties comparable with those of benzene itself, little evidence has been reported to suggest that the chemical reactivity of metallabenzenes is similar to that of benzene. The research described in this chapter provides the first example of a metallabenzene complex that undergoes aromatic electrophilic substitution. Thus, the metallabenzene complex Os(C[SMe]CH=CHCH=CH)(cis-I)(Co)(PPh3)2was brominated, chlorinated, and even iodinated. Crystal structure determinations and NMR studies showed that C5, which was activated by the thioether functionality, was the preferred site of electrophile attack. Even more significantly, Os(C[SMe]CH=CHCH=CH)(cis-I)(Co)(PPh3)2 was nitrated with either Cu(NO3)2/acetic anhydride, or with the more potent reagent NO2CF3SO3.CF3SO3H. The site of nitration was identical with that of halogenation, namely, C5. Previous syntheses of metallabenzenes had reported the use of the simplest alkyne, ethyne. This chapter describes the first metallabenzene complex prepared from propyne, giving the metallabenzene Os(&#951;2-C[S]C{CH3}=CHCH=C{CH3})(CO)(PPh3)2 and the oxidative addition product Os(C&#8801;CCH3)H(CO)(CS)(PPh3)2. Ten of the metallabenzene complexes were characterised structurally and the significance of the carbon-carbon bond lengths in the metallacyclic rings are discussed. The complete characterisation of these complexes by NMR spectroscopy revealed that the ring protons in the metallabenzene complexes, excepting H6, were at chemical shifts similar to those expected for normal aromatic carbons. Chapter Three examines the coordination of the strongly &#1495;-accepting tris(N-pyrrolyl)phosphine ligand to osmium. Two tris(N-pyrrolyl)phosphine complexes of Os(II), OsHCI(CO)(PPh3)2(P{NC4H4}3) and OsH(C6H4CH3-4)(CO)(PPh3)2(P{NC4H4}3), were prepared. Both of these showed significantly higher infrared carbonyl stretching absorptions than the analogous triphenylphosphine complexes, reflecting the &#1495;-acceptor nature of the tris(N-pyrrolyl)phosphine ligand. The osmium(O) complexes Os(CE)(CO)(PPh3)2P(NC4H4)3 (E = O, S) were prepared and the carbonyl complex was characterised structurally. The osmium-phosphorus(pyrrolyl) bond length of this complex was relatively short. The tris(N-pyrrolyl)phosphine ligand was in the equatorial plane as were the two carbonyl ligands. Chapter Four examines silyl and siloxane complexes of osmium and ruthenium. Although triethoxysilyl complexes of ruthenium have been prepared previously through ethanolysis of the coordinated SiCl3 group, the osmium analogues could not be prepared this way. It was found that Os(Si{OEt}3)CI(CO)(PPh3)2 could be prepared successfully by direct treatment of Os(Ph)Cl(CO)(PPh3)2 with triethoxysilane. Addition of carbon monoxide to the 5-coordinate triethoxysilyl complex afforded the dicarbonyl complex. The triethoxysilyl nitrosyl complex, OsH(Si{OEt}3)CI(NO)(PPh3)2, was prepared by oxidative addition of triethoxysilane to OsCI(NO)(PPh3)3, and the siloxane nitrosyl complex, Os(O[Si{OEt}3])CI2(NO)(PPh3 )2 was also characterised fully. Prior to this work only a single silatranyl complex was known. This chapter reports fifteen new silatranyl complexes and examines the unique properties conferred upon the silatrane by coordination to the metal. The silatranyl-containing complexes OsH(Si{OCH2CH2}3N)CI(No)(pph3)2 and OsH(Si{OCH2CH2}3N)(CO)2(pph3)2 were formed by oxidative addition of silatrane to the appropriate osmium(O) complex. Neither was suitable for further research because the chloro nitrosyl complex ejected silatrane in the presence of oxygen, and the dicarbonyl complex was isolated as a mixture of three isomers. In contrast, the unsaturated complexes M(Si{OCH2CH2}3N)C1(CO)(PPh3)2 (M = Os, Ru) were excellent materials for further study. The crystal structures of both of these complexes reveal typical metal-silyl distances with atypical silatranyl N&#8594;Si bond lengths. In both cases the N&#8594;Si bond length is elongated, the nitrogen is planar, and the cage is best described as quasi-silatranyl. The unsaturated nature of the metal in Os(Si{OCH2CH2}3N)CI(CO)(PPh3)2 offered access to derived complexes. The &#1495;-acid carbon monoxide added to the vacant site forming Os(Si{OCH2CH2}3N)C1(co)2(pph3)2. Methylation of the 5-coordinate silatranyl complexes, gave [M(Si{OCH2CH2}3NMe)CI(CO)(PPh3)2]CF3SO3(M = Os, Ru). This reaction has not been achieved previously for silatrane derivatives. These methylated complexes have the longest recorded N&#8594;Si distances for any silatrane derivatives, and display a tetrahedral bridgehead nitrogen which points out of the cage at the methyl substituent. Protonation of the 5-coordinate silatranyl complexes gave [M(Si{OCH2CH2}3NH)CI(CO)(PPh3)2]CF3SO3 (M = Os, Ru). The thiocarbonyl-containing derivatives Os(Si{OCH2CH2}3N)CI(CS)(PPh3)2 and [Os(Si{OCH2CH2}3NMe)CI(CS)(PPh3)2]CF3S03 were prepared and these complexes showed spectroscopic properties similar to those observed for the carbonyl-containing analogues. The 5-coordinate silatranyl-thiocarbonyl complex rearranged in the presence of carbon monoxide to form Os(&#951;2-C{S}Si{OCH2CH2}3N))CI(CO)(PPh3)2, which did not contain a metal-silicon bond. The silatranyl cage in the structure of this complex showed a very short N&#8594;Si bond with the nitrogen centre tetrahedral and pointing into the cage and towards the silicon atom. The osmium(IV) complex OsH3(Si{OCH2CH2}3N)(pph3)2 was prepared from OsH4(PPh3)2 and silatrane. The structure of this complex showed that the hydride ligands were oriented trans to a single triphenylphosphine in each case. Treatment of this complex with methyl iodide gave the quaternary salt [OsH3(Si{OCH2CH2}3NMe)(PPh3)3]I, and protonation gave [OsH3(Si{OCH2CH2}3NH)(PPh3)3]CF3SO3.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/531</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Putative Mucin-degrading Operon and a 6-Sulfo-N-Acetyl-&#946;-D-Glucosaminidase in Prevotella Strain RS2</field><field name="creator">Wright, Damian Paul</field><field name="description">A protective layer of mucus lines the surface of the gastrointestinal tract. Agents or processes that interrupt the continuity of this layer can potentially compromise the integrity of the mucosa, causing disease. The anaerobic bacterium Prevotella strain RS2 utilises the major structural component of the mucus layer, the mucous glycoprotein or mucin, as an energy source. Prevotella strain RS2 possesses a novel mucin-desulfating sulfatase (MdsA) which removes the protective sulfate ester group from N-acetyl-&#946;-D-glucosamine-6-sulfate sugar residues of mucin oligosaccharide side chains. The desulfation of sulfated sugar residues in mucin is thought to be the rate-limiting step in mucin degradation. The gene sequence for MdsA has previously been determined. The 4650 bp of genomic DNA downstream of the gene encoding MdsA was amplified by inverse PCRs and sequenced. Two complete open reading frames, mdsC and mdsD, were identified and are predicted to encode putative proteins of 362 and 1073 amino acids respectively. The deduced MdsC protein exhibited homology to the catalytic domain of aminoglycoside phosphotransferases and may perform a similar function. The deduced MdsD protein is predicted to be transported to the periplasm and/or outer membrane, and based on homology, may have a multiprotein proteolytic function similar to the tricorn protease. Northern and Western blot analyses suggest mdsA, mdsC and mdsD are coexpressed and their expression is increased when Prevotella strain RS2 is grown on mucin. This work is the first mucin-degrading operon of genes to be described. Also during the course of this research, a novel desulfating enzyme, 6-sulfo-N-acetyl-&#946;-D-glucosaminidase(6-SNG) was discovered in Prevotella strain RS2. The enzyme can remove intact N-acetyl-&#946;-D-glucosamine-6-sulfate residues from sulfated sugar substrates and is different to MdsA which removes the sulfate ester group. A procedure for the partial purification of active 6-SNG has been determined. The 6-SNG is predicted to corresponded to a 67.0 kDa SDS-PAGE protein band though several isoenzymes or fragmentation products were detected during the purification. The 6-SNG is located in the periplasm of Prevotella strain RS2 and is expressed at increased levels when grown on mucin. Inhibition studies for the partially purified enzyme have identified a number of potential enzyme inhibitors. This work represents the first 6-SNG to be described that may play a role in mucin-desulfation.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/607</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Building Institutions for Sustainability: A New Zealand Case Study</field><field name="creator">McKenzie, Stephen Peter</field><field name="description">One of the most important challenges facing Western capitalist societies at the beginning of the 21st century is how to achieve sustainable economic, social and environmental futures. The successful translation of the principles underpinning sustainability into concrete outcomes is dependent on the institutional context within which political contests over alternative futures take place. It is as important to build an institutional fabric that preserves sustainability options for future generations as preserving the environment itself. The importance of aligning juridical-political institutions with the principles of sustainability has become embedded in international political agreements, global action plans such as Agenda 21 and national and international policy discourses. Yet little attention has been paid to investigating the impact of juridical-political institutions on the achievement of sustainable futures let alone implementing these recommendations. Between 1984 and 1991 New Zealand actively reconfigured its juridical-political environmental institutional fabric. The reform process was driven by a desire to create a new market based long wave of economic growth and to actively incorporate the principles underpinning sustainability into the juridical-political institutional fabric. The reforms involved the restructuring of the national state's environmental bureaucracy, the reorganisation of regional and local government and a comprehensive review of environmental and planning legislation that resulted in the enactment of the Resource Management Act l99l (RMA). This dissertation aims to test common assumptions about the importance of juridical-political change for sustainability. It investigates the extent to which juridical-political institutions help to secure sustainable outcomes drawing on a geographically inspired, theoretically informed investigation into recent attempts to manage the water quality of New Zealand's largest lake, Lake Taupo. The dissertation argues that juridical-political institutions for sustainability have a regulatory role and a governance role. In the former instance, they attempt to redefine the relationship between economy, society and environment in a manner that supports continued capitalist accumulation. In the latter instance, they establish the rules within which particular contests over environmental futures are fought. The precise outcome of contests over the environment depends on the complex interaction of institutions, material factors, actors, strategies and discourses. Juridical-political institutional change may help to steer society towards sustainability. It does not, however, guarantee sustainable outcomes. While it is important to build juridical-political institutions that incorporate the principles underpinning sustainability the process of achieving sustainability requires also requires reflexive political action and value change through society. Key words: juridical-political institutions, sustainability, regulation, governance, water resource management, New Zealand, Resource Management Act 1991.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/635</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterization of the Plant CXE Carboxylesterase Family</field><field name="creator">Marshall, Sean D.G</field><field name="description">A large family of plant carboxylesterase genes (CXEs) has been identified, which may encode enzymes involved in secondary metabolism (among other potential functions) in higher plants. CXE family members were identified from the model plants Arabidopsis thaliana (20) and Oryza sativa (48), from the commercial fruit crops Actinidia spp. (12), Malus pumila (12), and Vaccinium corymbosum (1), plus several CXEs previously identified from a variety of other plant species. Plant CXEs share conserved sequence motifs and secondary structure characteristics with members of the &#945;/&#946; hydrolase fold superfamily. Phylogenetic analysis of the plant CXE genes distinguishes eight distinct clades. Detailed examination of the A. thaliana genome reveals that the AtCXEs are widely distributed across the genome, being present in four out of five chromosomes. Of the inter-chromosomal duplication events, two have been mediated through newly identified partial chromosomal duplication events that also include other genes surrounding the AtCXE loci. Eighteen of the 20 AtCXE genes are expressed over a broad range of tissues, while the remaining two unrelated genes are expressed only in the flowers and siliques. Four plant CXE carboxylesterases (A. thaliana CXE18, 20, Actinidia spp. CXE1, and M. pumila CXE1), representing two separate phylogenetic clades (clades II and IV), were recombinantly expressed in bacteria. The expressed CXEs were inhibited by organophosphates. Kinetic analysis with a series of 4-methyl umbelliferyl esters showed that substrate affinity for all four CXEs increases as the acyl chain length increases. Reaction efficiency of the plant CXEs is split along clade boundaries, with the two clade II enzymes preferring short acyl chain esters (acetate to butyrate), while the two clade lV enzymes prefer mid to longer acyl chain esters (heptanoate to laurate). A large number of volatile esters commonly found in plants can be hydrolyzed by these CXEs. Substrates utilized range from simple straight chain hydrocarbons (e.g. butyl acetate, hexyl hexanoate) to esters possessing more complex branched (e.g. linalyl acetate) and aromatic structures (e.g. methyl salicylate), suggestive of a spacious active site. Preliminary metabolic profiling of four AtCXE T-DNA insertion mutants reveals subtle differences in metabolite levels when compared to wildtype plants. This initial characterization of the CXE family provides a foundation for future structural studies as well as hypotheses for the role(s) these enzymes play in plants.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/636</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Flexible Mixed Models: Regression Splines and Thin-Plate Regression Splines in a Mixed Model Framework</field><field name="creator">Mackenzie, Monique L.</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/650</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Johann Jacob Bodmer, Interculturalist Cultural Realignment in the 18th Century and the Role of a Zurich Translator</field><field name="creator">Baumer, Helen</field><field name="description">Johann Jacob Bodmer stands at the beginning of a new era that saw the establishment of major English literary influences in Germany along with the rise of English to become a language of importance of the European stage. The particular importance of this eighteenth-century Zurich translator and literary scholar lies in his translation of a canonical work of English literature, Paradise Lost, and in his tireless efforts to develop appreciation of this work in the German debate on aesthetics and translation of the 1730s. Bodmer was strongly opposed by scholars wishing to establish in Germany the neoclassical aesthetic conventions prevailing in France, then the hegemonic power in Europe. By overcoming the advocates of French literary models he paved the way for the widescale translation of English authors such as Shakespeare, and the adoption of English models. As a translator, Bodmer advocated norms of faithful translation that deviated from those advanced for Germany by the advocates of French literary models. This study explores the origin of the new Zurich ideas, and outlines the extensive debate on translation conducted in Germany in the 1730s, in which Bodmer and his colleague Johann Jacob Breitinger overturned the arguments of Johann Christoph Gottsched and his supporters. In a number of respects, Bodmer and Breitinger's ideas on translation can be seen as precursors of the 'foreignising' approach to translation developed by German thinkers such as Friedrich Schleiermacher at the end of the eighteenth century. My study also investigates Bodmer's translation practice in detail, based on analyses of his German translations of Paradise Lost. It gives particular attention to the way in which the debates of the 1730s prompted changes in his thinking on translation. Of especial interest here are his ideas on the translation of metaphor, to which he appears to have devoted more attention than any thinker before him. My study applies a new approach to studying translation history currently being developed by translation scholar Anthony Pym. Pym's 'professional interculture' ideas focus particular attention on individual translators and groups of translators, and the importance of their debates and discussions for negotiating translation norms.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bodmer, Johann Jakob</field><field name="subject">Translating and interpreting</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/653</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Knowledge and Vital Piety: Methodist Ministry Education in New Zealand from the 1840s to 1988</field><field name="creator">Thompson, Susan J.</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the history of Methodist clergy training in New Zealand from the 1840s, particularly as it was carried out at Trinity College between 1929 and 1988. It explores the way Methodist theological educators struggled with the tensions between a focus on active piety and practical training on the one hand, and intellectual and academic scholarship on the other. The thesis gives a chronological account of the work of Trinity College and the training ventures that preceded it, and reflects upon the main emphases of ministry education throughout the period. Changes in the relationship between academic, practical and spiritual aspects of preparation are discussed in detail through a study of the curriculum, skill development opportunities and community life of the theological institutions. In considering the interweaving forces that shaped Methodist training, the thesis notes the critical influence of the aims and vision of the college's principals, and of the needs and concerns of New Zealand Methodism as a whole. It explores the implications for ministry education of internal tensions and shifts in emphasis within the denomination, which produced among Methodists differing priorities for church life and ministry. These factors are viewed within the context of world-wide trends in ministry training, and of social, political and economic changes often arising out of the New Zealand setting. The interaction between such imported and local forces points towards aspects of Methodism's sense of self-understanding as a church with a New Zealand ethos. The thesis reflects upon some of the outcomes of Methodist preparation, both in terms of the kind of ministry it produced, and in the way training emphases helped to shape the direction and identity of the denomination. It explores the creative, yet sometimes divisive, effects of college initiatives in such areas as biblical scholarship, worship, and pastoral understanding. The thesis also examines the particular impact of ministry education upon Methodism's Maori, women and Pacific Island students, arguing that the theological institution often struggled to acknowledge the distinctive needs of these groups. The thesis concludes that the history of Methodist ministry education from the 1840s to 1988 has been one of shifting emphases and varying combinations of priorities as, in each period, Methodists have struggled to embody in training programmes just what it means to reflect a Methodist identity.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/689</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Practical Light Field Rendering</field><field name="creator">Van der Linden, Jarno</field><field name="description">Light field rendering is an image-based rendering method first explicitly described in 1996. The light field function determines the radiance, or colour, seen along any ray into or out of a scene. It is a function over a 4D space of directed lines. With some restrictions on the placement of the eyepoint, almost any view of the scene can be recreated by sampling the light field function for every ray that goes through the eyepoint and the scene. In practice, the light field function consists of discrete samples obtained either photographically using a calibrated camera setup, or from computer-generated imagery. Light field rendering is a purely image-based rendering technique. No geometric information about the scene is required or derived in the process. Although potentially capable of creating photorealistic renderings quickly, light field rendering has seen little use in either the research community, or the wider graphics world. The reasons may be traced to a number of weaknesses and limitations in the method, which make its use impractical. This thesis explores and improves upon several aspects of light field rendering, with the aim of making it a more practical means of image-based rendering. The main contributions are: &#8226; Better interpolation using a focal distance for improved rendering quality. &#8226; Incorporating depth information in the light field. &#8226; A light field parameterisation which encompasses the entire light field scene within a single structure. &#8226; Creation and rendering of compressed light fields using the standard MPEG video encoding scheme. &#8226; Use of light fields as a scene element in combination with polygon rendering. The most important contribution of this thesis is the use of light field rendering in combination with another rendering method, namely polygon rendering. A scene can be composed using both polygon objects and light fields. Light fields can intersect with other light fields or with polygonal objects, and still be rendered in a consistent manner from all view directions. This demonstrates, for the first time, that light fields can be used as part of a general rendering system in a practical manner.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/762</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Turf Wars in Environmentalism: Competing Discourses in Hydroelectric and Nuclear Power Campaigns in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Wilson, John Francis Hamilton</field><field name="description">This study examines the role of environmental movement organisations in New Zealand during the early years of the 1970s. The study takes a comparative case study approach that examines the way competing discourses were used by these organisations to oppose construction of two hydroelectric power schemes and a nuclear power proposal. Based in frame analysis, the aim of the study is to examine the mobilisation of discourse as an indicator of the ability of environmental concern to politicise the energy policy domain. Research is performed in three areas: identification of the interpretive packages and discursive frames that delineate environmental discourse up to 1976, measurement of these discourses mobilised by environmental movement organisations, and an assessment of the influence this mobilisation had on the politicisation of the energy policy agenda. The study uses both qualitative and empirical methods. Qualitative research is performed to identify the discursive interpretive packages and frames through a hermeneutic analysis of the literature on the history of the environmental movement. This analysis shows that three historically distinct environmental movements can be identified up to the mid-1970s. These are the conservation, preservation, and political ecology movements whose discourses can be analysed in terms of three culturally resonant frames. The study finds that these interpretive frames - the rational, the moral and the aesthetic - offer similar but competing understandings of the environment. The empirical research is based on three data sets - the submission records presented to three commissions of inquiry held between 1970 and 1976. These samples are used to estimate and compare the mobilisation of positions taken by a diverse range of environmental movement organisations. The results of this analysis suggest that, to varying degrees, these competing discourses help to politicise the energy policy domain. Conservationism was found to be the least mobilised environmental discourse by environmental organisations. Nevertheless, it provided institutional energy policy actors with a rhetorical strategy in an interpretive arena in which resource development claims could be presented and defended. Environmental organisations were found to be important political actors not just because of their ability to mobilise organisational resources, or take advantage of political opportunities, but as engaged in discursive attempts to set the frames in which public discussion about energy policy issues took place. The study concludes that this political role may ensure the environmental movement remains an effective and non-transitory new political actor able to compete politically with, rather than for, party attention. It is the discursive ability of environmental movement organisations that allows them to compete in an increasingly politicised discursive sphere.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/693</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Costs and Benefits of Alternative Employment Structures: A Comparison of Employees and Contractors</field><field name="creator">Peel, Simon Mark</field><field name="description">Managers make choices regarding the types of employment structures that meet the needs of the firm, and workers make choices regarding the type of arrangement that meets their needs. Various streams of literature (for example, economics, human resource management, industrial relations, and organisational/industrial psychology) offer perspectives on why an employment relationship or a contractual relationship might be preferred under particular circumstances. However, it is often the needs of the firm that are deemed of primary importance, and it is the perspective of the firm that dominates the analysis. This kind of single perspective weakens our understanding of the employment relationship. It jacks recognition of the importance of matching the needs of the worker with the needs of the business. This thesis brings together the employer perspective and the worker perspective in an attempt to deepen our understanding of core/periphery preferences in today's labour markets. The research utilises a multiple case study design to investigate managers' decisions to use self-employed contractors or employees for particular jobs, and workers' decisions to seek or accept organisational employment or self-employment (contracting). Field research resulted in the development of seven case studies, encompassing two very different industries, and two very different groups of workers. The thesis attempts to build theory through explaining management 'analyses' of the factors relevant in the decision to employ or contract, and worker decisions to prefer employment or contractor status. In examining employer and employee 'employment structure choice', the thesis seeks to deepen our understanding of the interactional dynamics of employment relationships. It concludes that managers and workers who more carefully assess the extent to which a particular employment structure best meets the needs of both parties are better placed to build highly effective relationships.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/774</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Assessment in a Pre-Service Teacher Education Programme: The Rhetoric and the Practice</field><field name="creator">Hawe, Eleanor M.</field><field name="description">This study investigates how students, lecturers and others involved in a teacher education programme at a large metropolitan college of education experienced and interpreted assessment. To understand the actions and associated meanings of participants, the researcher worked 'in the field' (Burgess, 1984). Fieldwork was conducted over a period of forty months while the researcher was employed as a lecturer at the college. In addition to being a full participant /opportunistic complete member (Adler &amp; Adler, 1987, 1994; Riemer, 1977), the research roles of observer-participant and participant-observer (Adler &amp; Adler, 1987, 1994) were assumed. Each role provided access to different sources of data. Prolonged engagement in the field generated a detailed, rich data base that reflected the everyday lived experiences of participants. Data gathering techniques centred on observation, informal listening, formal interviewing and the study of documentary evidence. Analysis and organisation of data were informed by the constant comparative method (Glaser &amp; Strauss, 1967) and analytic induction (Denzin, 1970). These processes resulted in the development of a number of conceptual categories and related properties (Glaser &amp; Strauss, 1967) which represented the interpretations and understandings of participants. Students were found to have expectations regarding the outcomes of assessment, they reacted emotionally to these outcomes and attributed both success and failure, in the main, to external factors (Weiner, 1985). Assessment was perceived by them as a highly subjective activity and they personalised the assessment process. Game playing, negotiation of outcomes and cue seeking were common practice among the student population. Assessors also personalised the assessment process, using criteria and standards they considered important, to judge the student. Assessor personalisation was linked to a reluctance to award fail grades. Thus a marked disjuncture was apparent between the assessment rhetoric of the institution and both assessor practice and student behaviour. Two class based case studies provided additional insights into the meaning that assessment held for participants and highlighted the complex interrelationship between assessment, learning and teaching.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/632</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Prophecies of the Great Canyon of Toi: a history of Te Wha&#772;iti-nui-a-Toi in the western Urewera Mountains of New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Wiri, Robert K.J.</field><field name="description">This doctoral thesis is a social history of the lands and people Te Wh&#257;iti-nui-a-Toi, also known as The Great Canyon of Toi, a small isolated valley located on the western borders of the Urewera mountains of New Zealand.

In Part I of the thesis, chapters four to six, the mana M&#257;ori model is presented, which proposes the view that there is a peculiarly M&#257;ori way of knowing the social history of Te Wh&#257;iti-nui-a-Toi. Part I is divided into three domains of the spiritual, human and earthly authorities. In Part II, chapters seven to nine, the mana P&#257;keha model is presented, which argues that there is a peculiarly P&#257;keha way of knowing that same social history. Part II is divided into the three domains of initial alienation, legal imperialism, and neo-colonialism. Part III, chapter ten, analyses the power-struggle between the models of mana M&#257;ori and mana P&#257;keha and explores the dynamics of the relationship between M&#257;ori and P&#257;keha ways of knowing the social history of Te Wh&#257;iti-nui-a-Toi. The title of this thesis, 'The Prophecies of the Great Canyon of Toi', is a direct reference to a song composed by Te Kooti at Te Wh&#257;iti-nui-a-Toi in 1884. The lyrics of this song form a theoretical framework for this thesis and the song provides a new and fresh way of seeing the history of New Zealand. Finally, the events foretold in the song have all been fulfilled and are confirmed by historical events that are explained throughout the body of the thesis.

Given the nature of the phylogenetic model, it is expected that phylogenetic analyses only work well on populations that have stopped sharing biological information. This is particularly pertinent when looking at phylogenies of Pacific populations. This thesis presents a unique biological approach to the study of human settlement and population mobility in Polynesia, focusing on an animal that was transported through the Pacific by the ancestral Polynesians. I argue that analyses of genetic variation of the Polynesian rat (Ratus exulans) are appropriate for a phylogenetic model of human colonisation and mobility. DNA phylogenies derived from 132 mitochondria1 control region sequences of ratus exulans from East Polynesia are - presented. These results (1) identify a Southern Cook/Society Islands origin for all East Polynesian R. exulans populations, (2) indicate dual origins for Hawaiian R. exulans, and (3) indicate multiple origins for New Zealand Ratus exulans. These results are inconsistent with models of Pacific settlement involving substantial isolation following colonisation, and confirm the value of genetic studies of commensals for human prehistory.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420300 Cultural Studies::420307 Pacific cultural studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/597</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Phenology and frugivory of large-fruited species in northern New Zealand and the impacts of introduced mammals</field><field name="creator">Dijkgraaf, Astrid Cora</field><field name="description">This thesis investigated the reproductive phenology, fruit features, dispersal and seed predation of native New Zealand fleshy-fruited species, concentrating mainly on fruits larger than 10-mm in diameter borne by trees.  There are several species with large tree-borne fruit in New Zealand and they currently only have one seed disperser (kereru, Hemiphaga novaeseelandiae).  Historical evidence suggests that kereru might have been the sole effective disperser for most of the Quaternary.  Thus the New Zealand large-fruited frugivore system is relatively simple.  It might, therefore be possible to test whether competition amongst large-fruited species for dispersers has resulted in character displacement in the timing of ripe fruit presentation.  With this in mind I examined the timing of ripe fruit presentation &#8211; the phenological patterns &#8211; and nutrient complementarity of fruit species known to contribute to the kereru diet.  Introduced mammals have impacted significantly on New Zealand forest ecosystems, including fruit production.  An experiment was designed to measure the level of mammalian fruit consumption.  Three paired forest patches, with similar topography, aspect and forest type, were selected.  Mammalian pests were suppressed in three forest patches, but left unchanged at the paired site.  This allowed comparison of fruit production and fruit phenology at sites with and without pest suppression.  The effects of mammal pests on kereru, other bird species and some insect species were also investigated.    Showing that phenological patterns have statistically significant character displacement has proved difficult in the past.  It was considered that significant differences might be obtained if phenological patterns were broken down in to the most important character displacement attributes.  These were thought to be: (1) order of ripe fruit presentation amongst species; (2) peak fruit production should be greater than could be expected by chance; (3) synchronicity of fruit production within species; (4) lack of significant overlap between species competing for the same resource.  The two sites with the longest phenological record and best level of pest suppression were used to investigate whether character displacement occurs amongst large-fruited species.  The fruiting pattern of large-fruited species in northern New Zealand was more akin to tropical forests with year round fruit supply, than to temperate forest with more seasonal fruiting.  The order of fruiting tended to be consistent between years at both sites.  Fruit was not produced throughout the year by individual species, but tended to occur in defined peaks.  A combination Simpson Index and Monte Carlo parametric bootstrap method was used to confirm that the fruiting peaks were non-random.   The theory of competitive displacement amongst co-existing species requires that little or no overlap should occur in the production of ripe fruits by competing species.  This means that the period of ripe fruit presentation for one species should not overlap significantly with ripe fruit production of another species.  This was tested by modifying a formula developed by Augspurger (1983) that considers the phenological state of an individual in the context of what all other individuals of that same species (for synchrony) or other species (for overlap) are doing over the same period.  A further development was the generation of critical values against which the values for individual species could be compared.   Species tended to be more synchronous than asynchronous in the presentation of ripe fruits but only one species was consistently more synchronous than the calculated critical value at both sites.  Two other species at Whitford Bush exceeded the critical synchrony value and several other species from both sites came close to exceeding the synchrony value.  Despite synchrony values being generally smaller than expected species tended to not overlap significantly with other species in some or all years.  Character displacement, in the form of timing of ripe fruit presentation, was demonstrated for most species.  However, it is not possible to conclude that this has come about through co-evolution, solely, with the frugivorous kereru.  Fruit nutritional analysis of a range of (mostly) large-fruited species gave rise to six &#8216;fruit types&#8217; that clustered on size, lipid content, sugar and moisture content, carbohydrate or protein content.  These categories and the nutritional values obtained for New Zealand fruits tended to agree with overseas studies.  Compared to overseas fruits, a generalist description of New Zealand fruits could be &#8220;relatively small, moist, fibrous but nutritionally poor fruits&#8221;.  In the forests of Auckland, fruit is available throughout the year.  Reasonable quantities of high-lipid fruits are available throughout most of the year, except for parts of summer, and there is little overlap between lipid-rich species.  High-sugar fruits are most common during summer and autumn.   Kereru were shown to use fruit species as they become seasonally available.  However, they preferred large lipid-rich fruits, which can amount to 40% or more of the diet at one time and possibly up to 80% of the diet fed to chicks.  Taraire (Beilschmiedia tarairi) and nikau (Rhopalostylis sapida) were the most preferred of the lipid-rich fruits.  Nikau is also a calcium-rich fruit.  Puriri (Vitex lucens), a large sugar-rich fruit, was a common dietary item, eaten throughout the year, even when the fruit was relatively scarce.  Kahikatea (Dacrycarpus dacrydioides; small and sugar-rich) was eaten by kereru when large quantities of ripe fruit were available.  The timing and nutrition of the fruiting species was generally complementary, with different nutritional components available from species fruiting simultaneously.  Observational data indicate that kereru generally prefer large-fruits over small fruits.  The greatest numbers of feeding observations were of kereru taking fruits that were too large to be taken by other extant bird species.   Fruit species were available and eaten throughout the period that foliage (e.g. kowhai Sophora spp.) was also eaten.  Kowhai leaves and other sources of foliage have higher concentrations of nitrogen than most fruits.  Thus perhaps a switch to utilizing foliage is not so much due to a lack of food but more an issue of nutrient complementarity, during the periods of egg development and nesting.   Possum (Trichosurus vulpecula) and rodent (Rattus spp., Mus musculus) control was reflected in the number of possums and/or rodents caught in forest patches at the end of the study.  Long-term pest mammal suppression resulted in no trappable possums, rats or mice.  Sites lacking mammal suppression had moderate to high numbers of possums and rodents.  Possum numbers were lower at one site with partial possum suppression but lacking rodent suppression.  Rodent (rats and mice) numbers were generally too low to make valid comparisons but appeared somewhat elevated at the site with partial possum suppression.   Possum droppings were more frequent in seedfall traps at sites with no systematic possum suppression.  Rodent droppings had less clearly defined patterns and showed more seasonal variability than possum droppings.  The data for number of pest-mammal droppings in seedfall traps generally support the mammal trapping data.   Possums and rodents had adverse effects on fruit production at sites without pest suppression.  Suppression of possum and rodent numbers resulted in more fruit production, less fruit damaged, more fruits maturing and more fruits consumed by birds that void the seed unharmed.  Pest suppression also ensured that ripe fruits were available throughout the year, supporting resident native frugivores.  Partial possum control resulted in both the production of more fruits and proportionally more possum and rodent damaged fruits.  Mammal pests showed preference for energy rich fruits such as taraire, and nikau, which are also preferred by kereru.  Pest suppression generally increased the number of traps with insect or kereru droppings, except at the site with partial pest suppression where the occurrence of insect droppings was relatively low.  It is not possible to determine whether the benefits to these species are solely through a reduction in possum numbers or through a combination of reduced possum and rodent numbers.  Bird encounter rates were generally greater at sites where pest-mammals were suppressed, especially for frugivorous birds.  This increased encounter rate is unlikely to be solely due to behavioral changes in the bird population since the proportion of consumed fruits also increased.  Other factors, such as forest patch size and forest patch isolation, are also thought to be important in determining bird numbers.  Some forest patches seemed to have insufficient kereru to consume and disperse available crops of large fruit.  The timing of fruit production and the nutrient content of the fruits resulted in some fruits being more attractive (e.g. high energy food source, or important seasonal nutritional component) to frugivores than others.  These fruits were consumed more often by both seed dispersers (kereru) and seed predators (possums and rodents).  Predation of fruits has negative consequences for the survival and fecundity of the kereru and long-term implications for the survival of these large-fruited tree species.   The interrelationships between ripe fruit production, disperser availability and predator impact has implications for managing forests and pest and kereru populations.  Management will also need to consider the plant species composition since there are fewer large-fruited species at southern latitudes and higher altitudes.  At northern latitudes pest suppression may be less successful because fruit is available virtually throughout the year and pest species may not be not food limited.  Fewer large-fruited species are found at more southerly or higher locations and might result in &#8216;windows&#8217; of food shortage that can be utilized for delivering toxic baits.  Being able to predict unusually large or small fruiting events would thus be very useful for conservation management.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/605</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Laser pyrolysis of selected halogenated compounds with W(CO)6</field><field name="creator">Allen, Grant Richard</field><field name="description">The pyrolysis of selected halogenated compounds in the absence and presence of W(CO)6 has been investigated using infrared laser powered homogeneous pyrolysis (IR LPHP). The chemistry of these compounds in the absence of W(CO)6 is dominated by the themes of dehydrohalogenation (where available) and C&#8211;X bond homolysis (where X = halogen). The pyrolysis of W(CO)6 in the gas phase at moderate temperatures leads to unsaturated W(CO)x species; these prove to be very effective and selective abstractors of Cl and Br atoms from the selected halogenated compounds. The subsequent chemistry is dominated by the resulting organic radical moiety; observed end products are ascribed to disproportionation, combination, addition, rearrangement, abstraction and fragmentation of this species. The results pertaining to the pyrolysis of several of the oxygen-containing halogenated compounds in the presence of W(CO)6 suggest that unsaturated W(CO)x species are also effective abstractors of atomic oxygen.

Accumulating evidence shows that the injured brain produces growth factors as an endogenous protective and regenerative mechanism. Several of these factors have been identified and include insulin-like growth factor-I, transforming growth factor and fibroblast growth factor. Recent work in our laboratory has shown that the growth hormone axis is also upregulated following hypoxic ischemic injury to the juvenile rat brain. Importantly, central treatment with growth hormone offered strong neuroprotection in this model. In vitro studies reported in this thesis have confirmed the neuroprotective properties of growth hormone. Growth hormone-induced neuroprotection occurs via a neuronal brain-specific growth hormone receptor, which behaves differently from that found in the periphery. Whereas both ligands are strongly somatogenic in the periphery, rat but not bovine growth hormone had strong neuroprotective, neurotrophic and gliatrophic effects in cortical primary cultures. This distinct ligand specificity agrees with previous in vivo studies in our laboratory. Further, I show for the first time that the prolactin axis, which is closely related to the growth hormone axis, is also upregulated within the injured brain. Surprisingly, central treatment with prolactin failed to offer neuroprotection. Immunohistochemistry however showed that prolactin and its receptor were strongly and primarily upregulated on reactive glia in the penumbra, with limited staining on neurons. This neuronal staining contrasts with a persistent and intense staining for the growth hormone receptor and the growth hormone binding protein on these cells. The lack of any neuroprotective effect of prolactin in vivo was confirmed using primary cortical cultures. In these cultures, prolactin had only gliatrophic effects. These findings indicate a primary role for prolactin in glial wound responses following brain injury. Furthermore, the prolactin axis was upregulated in the neurogenic subventricular zone and dentate gyrus following hypoxia ischemia. In a spatio-temporal fashion, the increased prolactin and prolactin receptor immunoreactivity was specifically associated with an increased neuroblast proliferation and migration within the neurogenic regions. A strong association between the prolactin axis and neuroblast activity was also seen in neuroblast migration routes. Interestingly, subsequent in vitro studies by T. Gorba in our laboratory confirmed that PRL has strong and direct proliferative and migratory effects on neural stem cells. In summary, these findings show for the first time that the growth hormone and prolactin axes i have distinct roles in the injured brain. The growth hormone axis provides neuroprotection through a distinct neuronal growth hormone receptor. In contrast, the prolactin axis is associated with glial wound repair responses, post-injury neurogenesis and neuroblast emigration. Since this prolactin-associated neuroblast activity was bilateral, prolactin may mediate distal processes such as the transfer of function to the uninjured hemisphere. In conclusion, the growth hormone and prolactin axes have distinct neuroprotective and restorative roles in the injured brain respectively. Activation of both systems may therefore benefit neurological outcome following injury.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/612</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Discourses of research policy in New Zealand, 1984-2005 neoliberalism, tertiary education and national science</field><field name="creator">Harvey, Sharon</field><field name="description">This thesis analyses research policy in the fields of New Zealand tertiary education and national science in the period 1984 - 2005. It poses the question: How has what can be done, said and written in tertiary education and science research shifted and how have shifts been constituted in policy and related texts? In addition, the study considers the overlapping and increasing convergence of research policy between the two fields (tertiary education and national science) as an example of what happens to previously discrete areas of policy development and their constitutive discourses under a state logic (and pervasive discursive formation) of neoliberalism. The key hypothesis is that the economic genre has come to dominate research discourses and related practices with increasingly problematic effects. The study is underpinned by a poststructuralist/postmodern philosophical position which seeks to interrogate, historicise, problematise and politicise dominant research policy discourses. Jean Francois Lyotard&#8217;s prophetic work, The Postmodern Condition: A Report on Knowledge (1984) is mobilised to argue that since at least the 1950s, the western world has been moving into a recognisably different mode of societal organisation and production. In the 2000s the role of technology and particularly computerisation in shaping our societies, identities and, as Lyotard argued, knowledge itself, is indisputable. Lyotard&#8217;s analysis of the growing importance of innovation and &#8216;techno-science&#8217; in the regeneration of international capital is highly pertinent to this study, as is his problematisation of notions of western &#8216;progress&#8217; principally through a theorisation of the metanarrative of performativity. The thesis is also strongly informed by Michel Foucault&#8217;s work. Of particular interest is his work on the imbrication of power and knowledge, the value of close historical investigations and how subjects become governed and govern themselves through the (usually unconscious) uptake of circulating discourses. For both Foucault and Lyotard the study of ruptures, continuities, emergences and descents in institutional discourses provides evidence on which to base judgements about the limits of what can be said in the institution at any one time. They both advocate studying &#8216;what we know so well&#8217; and &#8216;rendering the normal strange&#8217; in order to consider how the contours of dominant discursive formations might be constituted and to generate the intellectual resources to explore how matters might be organised otherwise.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/654</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Orca (Orcinus orca) in New Zealand waters</field><field name="creator">Visser, Ingrid</field><field name="description">Orca (Orcinus orca), also known as killer whales, are more widely recognised than other marine mammals. Although they have been reported from all oceans of the world, including the seas around New Zealand, information above anecdotal notes exists for only a few places. Orca are an apex marine predator that exhibits cultural differences in diet, vocalisations, and behaviour, between and within populations. This study was established to determine baseline information on New Zealand orca and to provide recommendations for future management and conservation. The conservation status of orca worldwide is poorly known, although two populations of the Pacific North West Coast of North America have recently been classified as &#8216;Threatened&#8217; and &#8216;Vulnerable&#8217;. Photo identification was used to determine the population size, distribution around New Zealand waters, as well as range use and association among individuals. The total New Zealand orca population is small (range 65-167 animals, with 115 calculated alive in 1997). Resighting rates were high, with 75 % (n = 88) of the animals seen on more than two occasions. The mean number of sightings for the 117 photo-identified animals was 5.4, the mode was one sighting, and the median 9 &#8211; 10 sightings. One orca was photographed over a 20 year period. Population structure, frequency of association with others, and other social behaviours were used to determine population demographics. The New Zealand orca population appears to be made up of at least three sub-populations based on geographic distribution (North-Island-only, South- Island-only and North+South-Island sub-populations). Preliminary mtDNA analysis supports the hypothesis that some New Zealand orca do not mix. The mean Association Indices within the North-Island-only and South-Island-only sub-populations are significantly greater than within the North+South-Island sub-population. Those animals sharing food had higher Association Indices than those who did not share food. Sex ratios appear similar within each sub-population and calves were present in each, suggesting all sub-populations are breeding. Feeding behaviour was observed to assess habitat use and differences between foraging strategies and prey preferences. Twenty four different species of prey have been recorded in the New Zealand orca diet. Of these, ten have not been recorded elsewhere. The prey consists of four types; rays (the most common food type), sharks, fin-fish and cetaceans (pinnipeds have not been identified as a prey source). Foraging strategies were different for each prey type, with benthic foraging for rays in shallow waters the most diverse strategy used in New Zealand. Food sharing was observed for all prey types. One of the three proposed New Zealand subpopulations appears to be generalist or opportunistic foragers, feeding on all four prey types, another sub-population slightly less so, feeding on three prey types, and the third sub-population appears to be a more specialist forager, only recorded taking one prey type (cetaceans). Potential threats to orca, in addition to small population size, such as bioaccumulation of toxic chemicals, oil spills, boat strikes and shootings are considered and recommendations for conservation and future management are offered. Whether the three sub-divisions within the New Zealand orca population are reproductively isolated and hence require separate management, and whether there is further sub-division within the proposed North+South-Island sub-population, requires further study including genetic analysis. Some level of ongoing monitoring is recommended to ensure that the population of New Zealand orca does not decline. In addition, records of stranding locations and details of strandings are appended. Twenty-four live strandings occurred, involving 63 killer whales, of which 17 animals were successfully refloated and two of these resighted. One was seen after three years (nine resightings) and the other after four months (10 resightings). Refloating stranded orca is recommended.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270700 Ecology and Evolution::270702 Marine and estuarine ecology (incl. marine ichthyology)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/614</field></doc><doc><field name="title">In vivo confocal microscopy of the cornea in health and disease</field><field name="creator">Patel, Dipika</field><field name="description">The cornea is the transparent structure forming the anterior eye. Principal functions include: transmitting and focusing light onto the retina, containing intraocular pressure, and providing a protective interface with the environment. The specialized microstructural organization of the cornea is key to these functions and maintenance of corneal integrity. In vivo confocal microscopy enables examination of the living human cornea at the microstructural level. This technique, in combination with computerized topography, corneal aesthesiometry and other clinical assessments has been utilized in a series of inter-related studies of the human cornea. Both slit scanning and laser scanning in vivo confocal microscopes were used and the attributes and performance of the two types of microscope were compared, demonstrating marked differences. Quantitative analysis of the sub-basal nerve plexus in the normal cornea and the inherited ectatic condition of keratoconus was correlated with central corneal sensitivity, revealing that nerve density does not change with increasing age and that nerve density is positively correlated with corneal sensitivity. However, in keratoconus, central corneal sensation, sub-basal nerve density, and basal epithelial density are all significantly lower than normal. A novel technique developed to map the corneal sub-basal nerve plexus enabled elucidation of the previously enigmatic architecture, revealing an overall radial pattern with a clockwise whorl at the area of convergence, inferior to the corneal apex. Keratoconic corneas demonstrated gross abnormalities of the nerve plexus even in mild cases. A two-dimensional reconstruction of the inferior limbus was also produced using this method. IV Analysis of the corneal endothelium in posterior polymorphous dystrophy revealed that endothelial density does not correlate with the clinical severity of this dystrophy. Key observations included hyper-reflective endothelial nuclei and apparent aggregation of keratocytes around the endothelial lesions. Investigation of hyper-reflective corneal endothelial nuclei per se, revealed that these are not seen in the normal cornea but are associated with endothelial trauma, intraocular surgery or disease states that primarily affect the endothelium. In conclusion, using in vivo confocal microscopy, these studies have provided important qualitative and quantitative data that add to our knowledge of the human cornea, at the microstructural level, in health and disease states.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/615</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A prospective investigation of cognitive-behavioural models of irritable bowel and chronic fatigue syndromes: implications for theory, classification and treatment</field><field name="creator">Spence, Meagan</field><field name="description">The purpose of this study was to prospectively evaluate the application of the cognitivebehavioural model to two common functional somatic syndromes: irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). A range of predisposing, precipitating and perpetuating variables operationalised from this model were assessed in two acutely ill samples. The significance and relative importance of these variables with regard to the development of post-infectious IBS and CFS were then examined. At the same time, information was gathered to assess the appropriateness of an overall conceptualisation for the functional somatic syndromes. Similarities and differences between the two syndromes were investigated, and the impact of differing thresholds and disability criteria were compared to determine the utility of current diagnostic criteria. Patients with a positive laboratory test result for Campylobacter gastroenteritis or glandular fever were recruited through general practitioners. A total of 1018 participants completed a baseline questionnaire at the time of infection which included measures of anxiety, depression, perfectionism, somatisation, perceived stress, acute illness perceptions and illness related behaviours. Those previously diagnosed with CFS or IBS were excluded, along with participants experiencing any medical condition known to impact on fatigue levels or bowel function (n=183). Participants completed follow-up questionnaires at three (93% response rate) and six months (90% response rate) post-infection. At each point, cases of IBS and CFS were identified using published diagnostic criteria. Results indicated that a range of cognitive, behavioural, physiological and emotional variables were significantly related to the development of both IBS and CFS. Whilst there were some similarities between the two conditions, there were also some key differences. Depression and somatisation were significant predisposing variables in the development of CFS, but not IBS, for which anxiety was a key predictor. Perceived stress and the type of acute infection were more important as precipitants of IBS than CFS. Campylobacter was a significant predictor of IBS at both timepoints, whilst the presence of this illness type also strengthened the association between IBS and the psychological variables. In contrast, glandular fever was a significant predictor of CFS at three months only, and this iii association was outweighed by the inclusion of the psychological variables. With regard to perpetuating factors, negative illness perceptions at the time of acute infection were significantly related to both conditions, and all-or-nothing behaviour was also associated with IBS. When CFS and IBS cases at six month follow-up were compared, CFS cases had higher levels of disability, but not health care utilisation. Finally, when subthreshold cases of IBS and CFS were compared to their diagnosed counterparts, on the whole they did not differ with regard to the psychological risk factors, disability or health care utilisation. These results support the application of the cognitive-behavioural model to IBS and CFS as a useful explanatory tool and guide for treatment. The results provide a degree of empirical detail that has previously been lacking with regard to these models. Comparing the application of the model to two separate conditions has demonstrated subtle but important differences between the development of post-infectious IBS and CFS. These findings suggest that an overall conceptualisation for the functional somatic syndromes may not be capable of determining and addressing such differences for individual conditions. With regard to the diagnostic criteria for IBS and CFS, results suggest that the current criteria may be unnecessarily restrictive and complex. Simplification or the formalised addition of subthreshold conditions may result in more widespread usage and clinical applicability of these criteria.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/616</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Qualitative topological coverage of unknown environments by mobile robots</field><field name="creator">Wong, Sylvia</field><field name="description">This thesis considers the problem of complete coverage of unknown environments by a mobile robot. The goal of such navigation is for the robot to visit all reachable surfaces in an environment. The task of achieving complete coverage in unknown environments can be broken down into two smaller sub-tasks. The first is the construction of a spatial representation of the environment with information gathered by the robot&#8217;s sensors. The second is the use of the constructed model to plan complete coverage paths. A topological map is used for planning coverage paths in this thesis. The landmarks in the map are large scale features that occur naturally in the environment. Due to the qualitative nature of topological maps, it is rather difficult to store information about what area the robot has covered. This difficulty in storing coverage information is overcome by embedding a cell decomposition, called slice decomposition, within the map. This is achieved using landmarks in the topological map as cell boundaries in slice decomposition. Slice decomposition is a new cell decomposition method which uses the landmarks in the topological map as its cell boundaries. It decomposes a given environment into non-overlapping cells, where each cell can be covered by a robot following a zigzag pattern. A new coverage path planning algorithm, called topological coverage algorithm, is developed to generate paths from the incomplete topological map/slice decomposition, thus allowing simultaneous exploration and coverage of the environment. The need for different cell decompositions for coverage navigation was first recognised by Choset. Trapezoidal decomposition, commonly used in point-to-point path planning, creates cells that are unnecessarily small and inefficient for coverage. This is because trapezoidal decomposition aims to create only convex cells. Thus, Choset proposed boustrophedon decomposition. It introduced ideas on how to create larger cells that can be covered by a zigzag, which may not necessarily be convex. However, this work is conceptual and lacking in implementation details, especially for online creation in unknown environments. It was later followed by Morse decomposition, which addressed issues on implementation such as planning with partial representation and cell boundary detection with range sensors. The work in this thesis was developed concurrently with Morse decomposition. Similar to Morse decomposition, slice decomposition also uses the concepts introduced by boustrophedon decomposition. The main difference between Morse decomposition and slice decomposition is in the choice of cell boundaries. Morse decomposition uses surface gradients. As obstacles parallel to the sweep line are non-differentiable, rectilinear environments cannot be handled by Morse decomposition. Also, wall following on all side boundaries of a cell is needed to discover connected adjacent cells. Therefore, a rectangular coverage pattern is used instead of a zigzag. In comparison, slice decomposition uses topology changes and range sensor thresholding as cell boundaries. Due to the use of simpler landmarks, slice decomposition can handle a larger variety of environments, including ones with polygonal, elliptical and rectilinear obstacles. Also, cell boundaries can be detected from all sides of a robot, allowing a zigzag pattern to be used. As a result, the coverage path generated is shorter. This is because a zigzag does not have any retracing, unlike the rectangular pattern. The topological coverage algorithm was implemented and tested in both simulation and with a real robot. Simulation tests proved the correctness of the algorithm; while real robot tests demonstrated its feasibility under inexact conditions with noisy sensors and actuators. To evaluate experimental results quantitatively, two performance metrics were developed. While there are metrics that measure the performance of coverage experiments in simulation, there are no satisfactory ones for real robot tests. This thesis introduced techniques to measure effectiveness and efficiency of real robot coverage experiments using computer vision techniques. The two metrics were then applied to results from both simulated and real robot experiments. In simulation tests, 100% coverage was achieved for all experiments, with an average path length of 1.08. In real robot tests, the average coverage and path length attained were 91.2% and 1.22 respectively.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/619</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A qualitative study of emotional experiences during the pre-psychotic period</field><field name="creator">Watts, Peter Murray</field><field name="description">Psychosis typically emerges after a heterogeneous range of premonitory symptoms. This has been labelled the &#8216;pre-psychotic period&#8217; (PPP). Emotional disturbances are prominent features of this state and have shown to be risk factors for psychosis. The present study had two interrelated aims: to explore in-depth the experiential nature of the emotional changes that occur during the PPP; and to examine whether there are similarities between these pre-psychotic emotional changes and the concept of delusional atmosphere. Twelve men experiencing first-episode psychosis with delusional thought content were recruited for the study. Information regarding their emotional experiences during the PPP was gathered using a semi-structured interview format. Corroborating information about observable changes in the men&#8217;s behaviour during the PPP was also gathered from a family member or friend of theirs who had close contact with them during this time. The data was analysed using interpretative phenomenological analysis. A variety of strong emotional changes were reported during the PPP, including depression, anxiety, anger, and guilt, as well as love and happiness. Negative emotions were prominent during this time, but positive emotions were also found to be a feature of this state for some people. Overall, the PPP was characterised by an increase in distress over time. Features of delusional atmosphere that were evident during the PPP included: experiences of derealisation and the environment feeling different; anxiety and confusion and a drive to find and explanation for the changes that were being experienced; and a sense of apprehension that something significant was about to happen. The relevance of these findings to researchers and clinicians working in this area is discussed.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology::380107 Health, clinical and counselling psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/620</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of Argentine Ant (Linepithema Humile) on Arthropod Fauna in New Zealand Native Forest</field><field name="creator">Haw, James</field><field name="description">Although Argentine ant(Linepithema humile), a highly invasive ant species, has been in New Zealand for at least l4 years, little is known about their ecology and potential for invasion. Increasing spread and establishment of populations throughout New Zealand is disturbing because of the devastating impacts documented on native invertebrate biodiversity overseas. The primary aim of this study was to determine the impacts of Argentine ants on arthropods in native forest habitats in west Auckland. Pitfall traps at invaded and uninvaded sites were used to quantify ant and non-ant arthropod faunas. Argentine ants did not adversely affect native host ant communities. Moreover, two ant species appeared to be resistant to invasion. Argentine ant invasion reduced the abundance of a few orders of invertebrates while several taxa were more abundant in the presence of Argentine ants. Distribution and foraging activity of Argentine ant populations were monitored in this study from 2000-2003. Also, rate of spread was investigated to evaluate whether native forest habitats would be at risk from invasion. Measurements of foraging ant trails on monitored tree trunks revealed seasonal distribution patterns involving high activity in summer/autumn and low activity in winter/early spring. Argentine ants were found to be established primarily along the edge of the forest and did not invade into the interior of the forest during the study period. An Argentine ant poisoning operation on Tiritiri Matangi Island in January 2001 provided the opportunity to document the results of the eradication trial. In addition, pitfall traps placed at two treated sites and one untreated site were used to compare pre-poison and post-poison effects on ant and non-ant invertebrate communities. Fipronil baiting at 0.01% effectively reduced Argentine ants at the study sites and very few ants were observed in both tree count and pitfall trap recordings two months after poisoning. The invasion of Argentine ants on Tiritiri Matangi Island decimated native host ants and no recovery was detected throughout the study. Several groups of invertebrates appeared to benefit from the removal of Argentine ants while a few showed no detectable changes. Conservation implications resulting from the findings of this study are discussed Also, potential future research involving Argentine ants are outlined.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270500 Zoology::270505 Entomology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/625</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A grounded theory of international information systems</field><field name="creator">Lehmann, Hans</field><field name="description">This research project establishes theoretical foundations for a better understanding of the factors that influence the design, creation and implementation of international information systems (IIS). Three cases of multinational companies - in 9 locations on 3 continents - were investigated to that end, using a grounded theory methodology. Grounded theory was chosen because the paucity of research into international information systems means that there is an insufficient base for verification-t1pe research approaches' The traditional grounded theory approach was extended to work with cases, whilst fully preserving the principles ofjoint coding and collection, constant comparison and theoretical sampling. After every case, the relationships between categories were formally subsumed into theoretical frameworks. As a final step, a substantive theory of the factors influencing IIS was formulated. It explains the specific nature and architecture of international information systems, what affects the way in which they are built and why their users will accept or reject them. The theory defines a generic architecture, specific for international information systems, consisting of a 'Central' part, containing shared systems, and 'Local' systems that are unique for each site. Synchronicity, the degree to which systems require same-time use of identical data and information, determines the central and local applications. It further governs the configuration and technical architecture of the IIS. The 'CentraI'/'Local'debate can become embroiled in antagonistic politics, acted out in an ever-present 'Force Field'. Two variables influence the intensity of the Force Field interactions: o Utitity of the system's functionality lowers the conflict potential all around; . using the IIS to increase central Control intensifies local management's resistance against invasion of their'turf . Acceptance or Rejection of an intemational information system depends on the net-balance of these opposing forces. At a more sophisticated level, User/IT Consensus Processes are effective instruments for neutering faction politics and maximising the Utitity of the resulting system, substituting 'Coutrol' conflict with rational dialogue or amicable persuasion. Most of the theory can be directly translated into a practical methodology for designing, building and implementing international information systems. Manyparts of the theory, however, are still in an 'approximate' state and point to several future research projects- They will be concemed with refining concepts, constructs and their relationships as well as further adapting and improving the extended grounded theory methodology used in this study.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/626</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Biophysical and Institutional Challenges to Management of Dairy Shed Effluent and Stream Management Practices on New Zealand Dairy Farms</field><field name="creator">Blackett, Paula Elizabeth</field><field name="description">New Zealand dairy farmers have been accused in a national 'dirty dairying' campaign of 'selfishly destroying the community's natural water resources' (Fish &amp; Game 2001, pg l) through a combination of point and diffuse source pollution and habitat modification. The dirty dairying debate in response to Fish &amp; Game's campaign is about the conflicts that arise through differing values of rural water resources in New Zealand. That farming practices affect freshwater ecosystems is broadly recognised but poorly understood. The problems encountered in New Zealand's dairy sector, however, are exacerbated by the nature of relationships between dairy industry actors, gaps in information and provision of environmental advice to farmers. This thesis examines aspects of the debate through scientific and social frameworks using three strongly interrelated investigations situated in the laboratory, field and social environment. Each investigation adds further levels of complexity providing potential biophysical solutions as well as insights into the challenges facing those seeking to manage the effects of dairy farming practices. Investigations focused mainly on dairy effluent and stream ecology in the Waikato and Taranaki areas. The research showed that both dairy shed effluent (DSE) dilution in stream flow and stream management practices, particularly riparian shading, were important in reducing the effects of discharges to stony stream communities. In some situations, diffuse inputs from stream management practices had already degraded stream communities, making them less sensitive to discharges. However, significant adverse effects on stream benthic invertebrates were observed for oxidation pond discharges at 338-fold and below, but not at 1000-fold dilution. Significant improvements in rural water and habitat quality are unlikely to be achieved under the regulatory regime in place at the time of the interviews carried out in this research. DSE discharges are controlled through statutory regulation, but in many cases the permitted dilution rates are too low. Controls on diffuse pollution and habitat modification are voluntary, and undertaken by some farmers. Improvements in rural water and habitat quality are constrained by a lack of clear understanding by farmers on the importance of DSE treatment and stream management practices and a lack of impetus to act. Contributing to this is limited availability, transfer and often misalignment of information between dairy industry actors involved in environmental management. However, enhanced information provision alone is unlikely to lead to improved rural water and habitat quality and Fonterra's Clean Stream Accord (May 2003), while contentious, represents a potentially effective way forward for stream management in New Zealand. Success of this Accord depends on all dairy industry actors (including farmers) working together and combining their strengths in order to generate useful, practical information and solutions to achieve improvements in rural water and habitat quality.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/634</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Factors influencing entry to residential care among older people</field><field name="creator">J&#246;rgensen, Diane Mary</field><field name="description">With the population increasing, and the occupancy and dependency levels of older people in residential care rising, it is essential to examine the factors surrounding admission. The reasons for an older person choosing to move to residential care in New Zealand are not well documented, and little evidence surrounds the process. Clearly there is interplay of many factors, such as risk mitigation by health professionals, co-morbid disease, and concerns of the family. Objective: To seek out the significant factors and influences which persuade an older person to enter residential care, and the subsequent satisfaction. Design: Longitudinal mixed methods design (N = 31), using interviews with older people who were referred by the Needs Assessment Services Co-ordination (NASC). Also interviewed were caregivers, NASC managers, and the Multidisciplinary team. This research, called Older People Entering Residential Accommodation (OPERA) was a sub-study of the Assessment of Services Promoting Independence and Recovery in Elders (ASPIRE) trial (N=569). The data from ASPIRE was also available for use in the analysis. Face-to-face or telephone interviews were held with older people in three cities who needed substantial levels of support. Findings: The most significant factors for increasing the likelihood of residential care entry were: to have the potential care-giving child living far away, and needing a lot of support with the higher level daily living tasks. Also significant was the older person being home alone for long periods. It was clearly shown that while the doctor had the most influence over the person&#8217;s entry into residential care, the older person had the most influence with the decision to stay at home. The vast majority of the older people staying at home were happy with their decision to stay there, but unfortunately the vast majority of older people who entered residential care were unhappy with their decision to move there. Conclusions: This study demonstrated who was at risk of residential care entry, who had the controlling influence, and the subsequent older person satisfaction. Also highlighted was the need for improved communication to the older person, with improved community support and more customer-focused residential care.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1762</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Collecting and Dividing : on the diversity of particulars and the framing of kinds</field><field name="creator">Moffatt, Barry</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/637</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Entrepreneurial Action: Casting the Entrepreneur in the Market Process</field><field name="creator">Woods, Christine</field><field name="description">The entrepreneur has been cast in many different roles in economic theory. Studies have highlighted the various roles and functions of the entrepreneur within the economic system, leaving entrepreneurial behaviour largely unexplored. This work examines entrepreneurial action in more detail, focusing on the decision-making process informing the entrepreneurial act: constructing the ends-means framework. An Entrepreneurial Decision-making Cast (EDC) is developed from theoretical work in four areas: i) contextualism; ii) the Kirznerian entrepreneur; iii) rationality and decision-making; iv) Personal Construct Psychology (PCP). A behavioural approach to entrepreneurial action, located within a contextualist framework, offers the opportunity to extend the Kirznerian notion of alertness and elucidate distinctive aspects of entrepreneurial decision-making. An Entrepreneurial Decision-making Model (EDM) is constructed drawing on the theoreticalfoundations of PCP and illustrative empirical research. lt is established that profit opportunities are not discovered. The entrepreneur subjectively construes an opportunity for gain based on a store of knowledge, as represented by a construct system. Furthermore, entrepreneurs adopt methodological pluralism when assessing constructed opportunities. Any change in knowledge, any revision of a constructed opportunity, is equivalent to learning. The EDM draws-out dimensions of entrepreneurial action, illustrating how endogenous change may occur in the market process. Entrepreneurial action transcends the traditional type cast role of the entrepreneur in economic theory. The entrepreneurial act unfolds in the market process and potentially arises from action taken by any of the four traditional categories of economic actor. The EDC extends our knowledge of entrepreneurial behaviour, casting entrepreneurial action as a central feature of the market process.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/642</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Invasion ecology and genetics of Norway rats on New Zealand islands</field><field name="creator">Russell, James</field><field name="description">Introduced rats have invaded over 80% of the world&#8217;s oceanic island groups, with devastating consequences for the endemic biota. Techniques developed in New Zealand allow rats to be eradicated from very large islands, enabling conservation of biodiversity. However even when rats have been eradicated, it is possible that they can reinvade islands. Current scientific and technological methods have failed markedly in preventing reinvasion. It is unknown why difficulties in preventing reinvasion are encountered, but it has been postulated that this is due to a change in behaviour at low density that has management implications. Norway rats (Rattus norvegicus) are particularly adept island invaders, due to their propensity to swim, and so experimental releases of of adult male Norway rats on to small forested rat-free islands in northern New Zealand were used to study the behaviour of invading rats and assess management methods. Currently management of islands to prevent reinvasion is undertaken without a standard framework or knowledge of the suitability of many control devices. Without testing devices under realistic field trials of single invading rats, it can not be guaranteed that they will successfully prevent reinvasion. Permanent island biosecurity systems performed better than contingency responses which evoked enhanced neophobia in invading rats. Invading rats were reluctant to interact with any artificial devices, particularly bait stations. An integrated approach using multiple devices including traps, poisons and trained rodent dogs was consistently the best approach to detect and eliminate invading rats, which can have high individual variability in behaviour. When animals arrive in a novel environment their behaviour will change, with particular focus on spatial exploration in order to acquire a cognitive representation of their new environment. Rats usually remained around release sites for three days, changing den site often, before establishing a stable den site and exploring the entirety of small islands in the first week. Prevailing nightly ranges were between 0 &#8211; 5 hectares, with at least 35% of any given nightly range not having been visited the previous night. Nightly ranges were constrained by den sites, which acted as central foraging locations. Invading rats could move over a kilometre in one night. A recent island invasion was used to collect samples of an invading Norway rat population prior to its eradication. Studies of small populations with only a single opportunity to collect specimens result in sparse data. Population genetic methods provide additional information which can be used in investigating a population. The effective population size is one such population biology summary parameter, and data on linkage disequilbrium can be used from a single sample to estimate effective population size. Simulated populations were used to assess the precision and accuracy of the estimator relative to true demographic values. Recent trends in census population size, as well as the mating system and sample size relative to effective population size, all have substantial effects on the bias of the estimate. It remains unclear how invasive species overcome bottlenecks from colonisation. Ecological and genetic methods were used to investigate a recently colonised small island population of Norway rats. Multiple genetic methods all detected a clear bottleneck signal, and parentage assignment revealed a promiscuous mating system. Norway rats are highly capable invaders of islands who have evolved life-history strategies allowing them to rapidly establish a large population, Recommendations are finally made for island biosecurity to prevent rat invasion. These recommendations are based upon consideration of dispersal and invasion rates, and methods of detection and prevention. If island biosecurity is conducted regularly with proven tools, it should be possible to maintain large islands free of rats even when a high invasion rate is present.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1205</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Influences on Midwifery Practice for the Management of Women in Labour</field><field name="creator">Freeman, Lesa Maree</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/652</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effect of AAV1/2 mediated delivery of brain-derived neurotrophic factor and fibroblast growth factor-2 on adult rodent neurogenesis</field><field name="creator">Henry, Rebecca Ann</field><field name="description">Neurogenesis is the process by which functionally integrated neurons are generated from progenitor cells.  In the adult mammalian brain two sites of high density cell division have been identified that contain neural progenitor cells retaining the ability to generate new neurons:  the subgranular zone of the hippocampus (SGZ) and the subventricular zone (SVZ) lining the lateral ventricles in the forebrain.  Several studies have suggested that SVZ neural progenitor cells in the adult brain can migrate into regions other than the olfactory bulb after either administration of growth factors, induction of neuronal cell loss or injury.  Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and fibroblast growth factor (FGF-2) play major roles in regulating the survival and fate of progenitor cells in the adult mammalian brain.  To determine the effect of BDNF or FGF-2 on neurogenesis in the injured adult brain, BDNF or FGF-2 were over-expressed in the subventricular zone (SVZ) via recombinant adeno-associated virus (AAV1/2) delivery and newly generated cells were identified using bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU; 150mg/kg intraperitoneal) labelling.  Selective striatal cell loss was induced in a subgroup of rats by unilateral striatal injection of the excitotoxin quinolinic acid (QA) 21 days after AAV1/2 injection and 24 hours prior to BrdU labeling.  The results of this thesis demonstrate that BDNF augments the recruitment, neuronal differentiation and survival of progenitor cells in both neurogenic and non-neurogenic regions of the unlesioned or QA lesioned brain.  BDNF also appears to contribute to the persistence of newly generated neurons in the QA lesioned striatum.  Our results provide the first evidence demonstrating the neurogenic effect of BDNF on compensatory striatal neurogenesis in the injured adult brain and suggest that enhanced BDNF expression may be a viable strategy for inducing or augmenting endogenous neural progenitor cell neurogenesis.  Unlike the effect of BDNF, FGF-2 appears to have no effect on proliferation and/or survival of neural progenitor cells in either the normal or damaged brain.  FGF-2 appears to be unable to act as a positive mediator of SVZ progenitor cell proliferation and neurogenesis in this study.  However, FGF-2 may be having an inhibitory effect on progenitor cell differentiation.  The negative result of the FGF-2 study may be of major significance in indicating the potential requirement of additional factors interacting with FGF-2 to influence neurogenesis.  The results from the FGF-2 study contribute to the research field in highlighting the complexity of the mammalian neurogenic process.  This thesis highlights the need for further investigation into multiple factor interactions, tighter regulation of the transgenic protein expression from the AAV1/2 delivery vector or alternative progenitor cell labelling paradigms.  However, it does show that if neurogenesis can be induced or augmented exogenously, neural progenitor cells may provide a substrate for repair in the adult brain and dramatically change therapeutic approaches towards the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Neurodegenerative Diseases</field><field name="subject">neurogenesis</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1492</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Teacher-Learners&#8217; Conceptions of Learning: The Impacts of Further Formal Study</field><field name="creator">Cliff, Alan Frank</field><field name="description">This thesis reports the results of a longitudinal study of the conceptions of their own learning of a group of educators (n=14) involved in further formal study at graduate level. Previous studies of conceptions of learning from the perspective of the learner him/herself have been conducted in a wide variety of contexts. This present study was an attempt to explore this phenomenon from the perspective of a group of New Zealand educators individually representing early childhood, primary, secondary and tertiary education sectors. The study had two aims: (1) the exploration of the phenomenon of learning conception at different points during and after these educators' engagement in graduate study; and (2) the investigation of change and stability in these learning conceptions, as well as those academic context features that might be said to be associated with that change or stability. The current study was substantively based on previous descriptive classifications of learning conception, derived from a phenomenographic methodology. Abstract classifications of learning conception using phenomenography have typically identified two discrete categories of conception, namely quantitative and qualitative conceptions. These categorisations have been viewed as hierarchically related to one another. The present study was directed towards the exploration of maximal variation in learning conception amongst this particular group of educators. Findings from this study suggest that there are complex inter-relationships between quantitative and qualitative conceptions, and that these conceptions are constitutive of cognitive, affective, social and moral dimensions. Furthermore, the findings suggest that change in conception is most powerfully influenced by courses in which course presenters adopt radical approaches towards content, methodology and assessment. However, change in conception does not necessarily result in change to these educators' professional practice. The conclusion to this thesis addresses the extent to which findings from this study might be said to be unique to this group of learners as adult learners. The conclusion also suggests that the manner in which learners' conceptions are viewed may be influenced by the particular paradigmatic view that the researcher adopts in exploring the phenomenon. Finally, the study concludes that the degree to which change in conception might be said to be long-lasting depends upon the relationship between the learning context and the work context in which the particular learners are operating.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/852</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characteristics of Nitrogen- and Iron-Limited Growth in the Diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum, and in Natural Phytoplankton Populations.</field><field name="creator">Grant, Coral M.</field><field name="description">The biochemical pathways involved in nitrogen (N) utilisation by marine phytoplankton have received considerable attention over the last forty years, but our understanding of these processes, and how they are affected by environmental change is still far from complete. This study investigates N metabolism in marine phytoplankton in both a controlled laboratory environment (using the coastal marine diatom Phaeodactylum tricomutum), and in the open ocean (e.g. Jellicoe Channel and the Subtropical Convergence Zone, New Zealand). Although the characteristics of ammonium uptake have been extensively studied in marine phytoplankton, comparatively little information exists on rates of assimilation. In this study, a robust method for measuring the rate of ammonium assimilation after a transient addition of ammonium is described. The method relies on the measured ability of the protonophore carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) to release unassimilated ammonium from the cell and prevent further assimilation. There was little or no correspondence between the rate of ammonium assimilation and rates of ammonium uptake or maximum glutamine synthetase (GS) activity in Phaeodactylum tricomutum. Moreover, in N-limited cells maximum GS activity was a poor measure of N incorporation under steady-state conditions. However, GS activity did provide reliable information on N status (e.g. increased GS activity with increased N-limitation). Comparisons of the effects of varying N-source suggest that nitrate-grown cells are not disadvantaged under conditions of N-limitation due to the extra costs associated with nitrate reductase (NR) and nitrite reductase (NiR) activity. The metabolic costs of growth on nitrate may be significantly increased under iron (Fe)-limitation, as both NR and NiR require Fe. Fe-limited chemostat cultures excreted nitrite and ammonium when grown on nitrate. This release is probably a response to insufficient photoreductant under Fe-limited conditions. However, under Fe-limitation cellular N and C was similar to that of Fe-replete cells, suggesting that the N-source used for growth (nitrate or ammonium) did not influence N-assimilation (i.e. that nitrate-grown cells were able to secure the extra reductant required to support growth) under Fe-limited, light saturating conditions. The Gln:Glu ratio (an index of the cellular N-status) was significantly reduced under N-limitation, but not under Fe-limitation. Measurement of several biochemical indicators of the physiological state of phytoplankton cells (e.g. Gln:Glu ratio, GS activity, and Fv/Fm ratio) permitted the nutrient status of phytoplankton populations to be investigated during the NIWA Ocean Fronts programme over the Subtropical Convergence Zone, New Zealand. Low Gln:Glu ratios suggested that phytoplankton in both Subtropical and Subantarctic waters were N-limited, with a marked increase in this ratio when Fe was added to Subantarctic phytoplankton. The temporal utilisation of N by neritic phytoplankton was also investigated in Jellicoe Channel, northeastern New Zealand. Again, several biochemical indicators (e.g. Gln:Glu ratio, GS activity, and Fv/Fm ratio) were used to identify the N-status of this neritic phytoplankton assemblage both during bloom and non-bloom periods.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270700 Ecology and Evolution::270702 Marine and estuarine ecology (incl. marine ichthyology)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/909</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Learning about Multiplication: An Interpretation of a Transition</field><field name="creator">Ell, Fiona Ruth</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/919</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Rock of Ages or the Winds of Change? The Impact of World War Two on the Anglican Church in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Haworth, Geoffrey M. R.</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the impact of World War Two, a period of dislocation and turbulence, on the Anglican Church in New Zealand. It does so in terms of the tension between a desire to defend and preserve the Church's assumed identity and role, and a positive acceptance of the possibilities for change that the war brought. This tension, between "holding the line" until peacetime, and welcoming changes that might benefit the Church's role and image in the community and witness to the "unchurched" is examined in a number of key areas of the Church's life. Wartime brought both challenge and opportunity to the Church in the areas of leadership, military chaplaincy, the Church Army, the role of women in Church and society, ecumenical initiatives, the regular life of parishes and other ministry units, pacifism, and endeavours to reflect theologically. In each area, the Church was facing questions about its identity, and therefore about its role in society. This thesis examines the thematic tension between the forces of stasis and of change with regard to the social backdrop of contemporary New Zealand society, where wartime was stimulating both a climate of change, and an attitude of resistance to change. Voices within the Church echo this ambivalence. Comparisons are also made with the wartime Church in England, which to most Pakeha New Zealand Anglicans was still the "Mother Church", and to some extent with the Church in Australia. Part of an emerging debate within the Church concerned whether it should continue with its self-identification as a quasi-English ecclesiastical outpost, or become a Church with a distinctive New Zealand identity, able to acknowledge and value its bi-cultural nature. This thesis concludes that, during the war and in the five years afterwards, the voices promoting stability and "business as usual" in existing structures and functions usually prevailed over those advocating structural and attitudinal change. Like the rest of the country, the Church was reacting to more than a generation of instability. After two world wars and the Great Depression, for the most part the Church wished to present itself as a "Rock of Ages", symbolising continuity, authority, and close identification with the political status quo. This self-image was challenged by those eager to see wartime developments become part of long-term change. When the war ended, the Church was not ready to fully face the implications of these factors for change. Until the 1960s and 1970s, an era of social upheaval, the Church wished to expand its existing operations to cope with population increase, rather than to question and redefine its own structures and identity.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/915</field></doc><doc><field name="title">White Light Feedback Interferometry for Aberration Correction, and Near-Real-Time Phase-Difference Amplification</field><field name="creator">Bold, Geoffrey Terence</field><field name="description">There has recently been much interest in the use of adaptive optics systems for automatic aberration correction in applications such as astronomical and line-of-sight imaging. The background of aberration correction is presented, reviewing applications of adaptive optics systems, and commonly used wavefront sensing and correcting techniques. Aberration correction systems use a variety of correction elements including liquid crystal devices and segmented mirrors. Clearly, characteristics such as response time, phase vs. drive voltage, and sensitivity to wavelength and polarisation state of input light are important to system performance. The characteristics of two liquid crystal spatial light modulators, pertinent to aberration correction, are initially investigated. Research on a novel white light feedback interferometric technique that can be used for aberration correction is then presented. Using this technique, a phase proportional to the interferometer output intensity is applied to a modulator within the interferometer to achieve automatic phase correction. The interferometer operates in white light. A theoretical analysis of white light feedback interferometry is given along with simulated and experimental results. The results show that aberration correction can, in principle, be achieved using the technique. Liquid crystal spatial light modulators suffer from relatively slow response times and a limited phase modulation range. Segmented mirrors have much faster response times, and a much larger phase modulation range, but are prohibitively expensive. Therefore, we decided to construct a 3x3 segmented mirror for use in aberration correction systems. The construction, testing, housing and mounting of the segmented mirror purpose built for aberration correction is then discussed. Phase-difference amplification is a technique that can be used for high accuracy phase measurement. Using this technique a diffraction grating is constructed using the interferogram of a test wavefront. The &#177;n orders diffracted from the grating are interfered together to form a phase-amplified interferogram from which a phase map of the test wavefront can be recovered. In the future, phase-difference amplification may be a very useful technique for aberration correction systems. Conventional systems use time consuming and inconvenient photographic techniques to construct the grating. The second part of this thesis describes several phase-difference amplification systems where the diffraction grating is written on a liquid crystal spatial light modulator. The liquid crystal devices, which have a high resolution and much faster response times than the photographic development time, make the systems convenient and allow near-real-time operation. A phase map of the test object is retrieved using phase stepping techniques. Experimental results for each system are presented and compared. They show that amplification factors of up to 6 are easily achievable.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/855</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Function of Reciprocity in the Histories of Herodotus</field><field name="creator">Paterson, Daphne</field><field name="description">This thesis is an inquiry into the function of reciprocity in the Histories of Herodotus of Halicarnassus. It examines the complex ways in which the historian weaves reciprocity into his stories of kings and tyrants, citizens and slaves, city-states and empires, men and gods. It investigates the way he records relationships of personal, political and religious reciprocity, positive, negative and retaliatory reciprocity to illustrate his themes, explain the cause of events and characterise individuals and city-states. And it explores how he uses language to emphasise the significance of the obligation of reciprocity in his Histories. Herodotus explains the cause of events in terms of the personal obligation of reciprocity. He moves his narrative forward through interlinking chains of reciprocal action and reaction to show that the obligation to take revenge and repay favours is a catalyst for historical action. Herodotus uses reciprocity for the purpose of characterisation. He characterises individuals through his stories of their observance or transgression of the obligation of reciprocity, he contrasts good men with bad by recording their actions of reciprocity, and he characterises city-states through his accounts of the reciprocal actions of their people. Through this use of reciprocity, Herodotus imposes upon his audience a picture, either positive or negative, of the men, women, and city-states whose stories he tells in his Histories. This thesis is an examination of reciprocity in literature. It is a study of reciprocity as it is presented by a master story-teller whose literary representation of reciprocity is more complex and more interesting than reciprocity as it is presented in the writings of behavioural scientists. It is an investigation into the way reciprocity functions in the work of a man whose stories have entertained and charmed his readers for centuries.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/914</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Genetic Engineering: The New Zealand Public&#8217;s Point of View</field><field name="creator">Gamble, Joanna</field><field name="description">In order to understand the New Zealand public's perceptions and attitudes towards genetic engineering of plants and plant-based products, an integrated set of seven studies was conducted with a total of 1158 people between March 1998 and May 2000. The first four studies concentrated on gaining qualitative, in-depth information that could be built on in later quantitative studies. Studies 1-3 involved focus groups conducted with the 'general consumer', Buddhists, and the environmentally concerned. Issues of concern included food safety, the desire for choice, failure of genetically modified products to offer benefits to the consumer, lack of trust in corporate and government motives and deep-seated moral objections to the technology. Study 4 involved attending a hui with Ngati Whatua of Orakei to explore Maori attitudes towards the technology. The relationship Maori had with food and the land, and the need to be consulted over issues to do with genetic modification were the two key areas that differentiated these people from the previous focus groups. Drawing on the belief that genetic engineering had nothing to offer to the consumer, study 5 explored the relative importance of price, benefit and technology on the purchase decision of consumers using conjoint analysis. Price was a key issue for many consumers. However, a significant segment had moral concerns about genetic engineering and their choices influenced by the technology used to produce the product, regardless of product category, price or benefit. For the most part, none of the health benefits played a role in the purchase decision for any of the consumers, but one segment of environmentally conscious consumers responded to pesticide-free tomatoes. One final segment of consumers could be described as relatively neophobic, preferring specific guarantees that the product was not genetically modified. A survey was distributed throughout New Zealand, based on Fishbein's multiattribute attitude model, and Azjen's theory of planned behaviour. The approach aimed to determine the important factors involved in acceptance of genetic engineering in food production, and predict likelihood of purchase of genetically modified tomatoes or jeans made from genetically modified cotton. Behavioural intention could be seen as requiring a two dimensional understanding: assessment of the risk-benefit trade-off involved in determining acceptance of genetic engineering in food production (influenced by general attitudes towards nature, and perceptions of own and authority's knowledge); and a measure of the social pressure and moral obligations associated with avoidance or purchase of a genetically modified product. Finally, the impact of information provision and debate on psychology students' acceptance of genetic engineering was assessed using a repeated measures intervention study. Although students who participated in the debate became more accepting of the benefits the technology could offer, little impact was made on perceptions that the technology was 'natural' or 'interfered with nature' &#8211; an interesting finding given those drawn from the previous study that revealed the importance of the moral dimension in determining acceptance. Students who were exposed to debate became more confident in their answers, while those who did not became less confident. They were also more likely to discuss the topic with family and friends, and become more aware of articles on the topic. The findings overall suggest that New Zealand consumers are currently unaware of, or disbelieving in, the benefits that genetic engineering can offer. Educating the public about these benefits will not necessarily make people more positively inclined towards the technology overall however. Rather, applications that will prove more universally acceptable will be those that either offer benefits that compensate for perceived risks and moral concerns of the application, or address those moral concerns directly.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/863</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Unit Standards and the University</field><field name="creator">Curzon-Hobson, Aidan</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the possible effects of the NZQA unit standard approach on the pursuit of higher learning. Through a critical examination of the debate concerning this issue, an argument is mounted that the key questions were left unanswered about the implications of unit standards. This is because the NZQA and the academic community failed to clearly define and defend a notion of higher learning, and in turn, why its pursuit should or should not be considered an integral practice and responsibility of universities in New Zealand. The initial focus of this thesis is a critical examination of the debate emanating from NZQA's decision to include unit standards in universities. In working through these issues within this debate, this thesis engages with the broader issue of how we ought to conceptualise the notion of higher learning, the role, ideals and values of a university, and the pedagogical implications of such a position. This discussion critically engages with the work of Ronald Barnett, Paulo Freire and Martin Buber. It develops and defends a notion of higher learning and elucidates why this form of learning is, and ought to be, considered a role and responsibility of contemporary universities. The key aim of this notion of higher learning is the development of a critical stance or critical being which is oriented towards all realms of experience. Thus it is a pedagogy that seeks to challenge students to understand their interrelationships with one another, knowledge and the world, and is underpinned by a critical, dialogical learning environment. It is a learning process that continually challenges students and teachers to confront the becoming, unfinished nature of reality, and perceive and create in the milieu of fragility and potentiality. Given this notion of higher learning, and having established its presence and role within universities in the New Zealand context, the thesis then examines what effects unit standards might have had upon its pursuit. It is argued that the inclusion of unit standards would have restricted key facets of this learning pursuit.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/711</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Synthetic Studies Towards Antibiotics Containing Phthalide Moieties</field><field name="creator">Sidford, Matthew</field><field name="description">An investigation into the synthesis of several analogues of antifungal agents related to the papulacandins was undertaken. Retrosynthetic analysis of these analogues identified phthalide (261) and allylstannane (278) as key intermediates in the synthesis of analogues of type (284). The key step in the synthesis of phthalide (261) was the ortho formylation via ortholithiation of amide (255). The synthesis of phthalide (261) was carried out over five steps in 35% overall yield from (255). Synthesis of the allylstannane intermediate from alcohol (351) proved problematic thus preventing further progress in this area of research. Synthetic studies toward the anti-helicobactericidal phthalides CJ-12,954 (56), CJ-13,014 (57), CJ-13,015 (58), CJ-13,0102 (59), CJ-13,103 (60), CJ-13,104 (61), and CJ-13,108 (62) were undertaken. CJ-12,954 (56) and CJ-13,108 (62) were chosen as initial targets. Retrosynthetic analysis identified phthalide (288), spiroketal ylide (297) and ylide (468) as key intermediates for the synthesis of the natural products (56) and (62). The synthesis of spiroketal epoxide (300) was successfully achieved in fifteen steps starting from materials (386) and (381) in an overall yield of 87o. Unfortunately all attempts to effect ring opening of epoxide (300) were unsuccessful. The racemic synthesis of phthalide (288) was carried out in six steps starting from material 2,4-dimethoxybenzoic acid (296) in 33% overall yield. Wittig coupling of ylide (468) with phthalide (288) allowed complete total synthesis of racemic CJ-13,108 (62) from (288) in 42% overall yield.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/917</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Choice Behaviour: Short- and Long-Term Effects of Reinforcers</field><field name="creator">Landon, Jason</field><field name="description">Behaviour was analysed at a number of levels in two series of concurrent-schedule experiments. In the first, six or seven concurrent-schedule components, each of which could have a different reinforcer ratio in it, were arranged in each session. In the canonical arrangement these components were separated by l0-s blackouts. Across conditions, the reinforcer ratios arranged in components were varied. The overall rate of reinforcement was constant throughout, and each condition was in effect for 50 sessions. The second series of experiments used a conventional switching-key concurrent-schedule procedure in which a single reinforcer (or reinforcer-magnitude) ratio was in effect for 65 sessions. Experiment 1 showed that behaviour adjusted very quickly to the rapidly changing contingencies. Sensitivity to reinlbrcement reached higher levels when the range of reinforcer ratios arranged was greater. More detailed analyses suggested that the variables controlling behaviour operated at a number of levels. First, each individual reinforcer had an effect on subsequent behaviour. Second, successive reinforcers obtained at the same alternative ("confirmations") had cumulative effects that were evident when behaviour was examined as a function of time since reinforcement (i.e., the change in behaviour after the third successive confirmation at the left alternative was greater than that after the second). Third, when these sequences of confirmations occurred more frequently, their behavioural effects were again increased. Finally. "disconfirmations" (a reinforcer obtained from the other alternative following a sequence of confirmations) had comparatively very large effects, and returned preference to levels controlled by the molar or sessional reinforcer ratio. Experiment 2 showed that the local effects of reinforcers evident in Experiment 1 were also present in steady-state data. Effects of individual reinforcers on behaviour were evident, as were longer-term effects of aggregations of reinforcers. Preferences were again more extreme in response to sequences of confirmations when those sequences occurred more frequently. Similarly, disconfirmations had comparatively very large effects, and returned behaviour to levels controlled by the molar reinforcer ratio. Moreover, these local effects of reinforcers were similar when either the reinforcer-frequency ratio or the reinforcer-magnitude ratios were varied. The present data question the commonly held assumption that behaviour is controlled by large aggregations of reinforcers. Control was evident at a number of levels, and attempts to model concurrent-schedule data are likely to require processes operating at multiple levels. The present data also suggest that the frequency with which sequences of confirming reinforcers occurred was central, and longer-term processes might be updated with the delivery of a disconfirmation. Moreover, different concurrent-schedule arrangements might result in these frequencies differing substantially with the same reinforcer ratio arranged. An increased focus on detailed data collection using relatively standard manipulations of reinforcer frequency, magnitude, and other independent variables that are known to affect choice, is recommended.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/912</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Different Realities: Challenging Conventional Ways of Conceptualising Delusions and Hallucinations</field><field name="creator">Aschebrock, Yasmin</field><field name="description">Delusions and hallucinations are typically regarded in contemporary Western societies as signs of serious mental illness - that is, as essentially meaningless surface expressions of a biological process, that are almost invariably distressing and harmful to those experiencing them. However, these conventional ways of conceptualizing delusions and hallucinations are increasingly being contested (by critical psychologists and by some of those who experience these kinds of phenomena). As part of this trend, this thesis highlights the need to move beyond traditional ways of construing delusions and hallucinations and to open up new ways of thinking about them. In Part One, I present analyses from an international survey of 58 mental health practitioners and researchers, which I conducted to investigate their understandings of delusional and hallucinatory content. I explore their views concerning the importance of attending to the content of delusions and hallucinations, and a possible relation between gender and the content of these phenomena. In Part Two, I present analyses of interviews with 11 women who have experienced delusions and hallucinations. I explore the linguistic resources available to those who experience delusions and hallucinations for talking about these kinds of phenomena, and the ways in which they may attempt to make sense of such experiences. I illustrate some of the challenges to traditional ways of conceptualising delusions and hallucinations by drawing upon the accounts of five of the women I interviewed. I aim, in this thesis, to question and disrupt conventional understandings of delusions and hallucinations and to increase the availability of some alternative (marginalised) ways of construing them. I emphasise the need to consider (and critically examine) the potential practical and moral implications of various ways of conceptualising delusions and hallucinations.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/916</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Partially Supervised Texture Segmentation and Retrieval</field><field name="creator">Yu, Linjiang</field><field name="description">Partially supervised texture segmentation/retrieval aims to detect regions similar to a given texture in an arbitrary background. Such one-class texture detection has many important practical applications to identify regions of interest in remote sensing, medical diagnostics, industrial vision, or content-based image retrieval (CBIR). At the same time it differs from and cannot be performed with conventional supervised or unsupervised segmentation/retrieval techniques. This thesis develops a novel partially supervised approach to segmentation and retrieval based on an original local-to-global texture descriptor. This latter exploits a distribution of distances between local and global frequencies of particular texture features. The empirical frequency distribution of the feature collected over the whole training texture globally characterises the texture. The similar distributions but collected within a moving window of a fixed size centred at each particular position in the image describe its local characteristics. The local-to-global distance distribution over a training texture provides a natural self-similarity threshold for separating the desired texture from each arbitrary background. The thesis investigates capabilities of characteristic translation invariant pair-wise interactions of pixel-wise colours as the texture features. The interactions are analysed using a generic Gibbs random field (GGRF) image model that produces a set of characteristic colour co-occurrence histograms (CCH) as generalised texture features. These latter are compared experimentally to other known features such as the marginal colour histogram (CH), the coordinated clusters representation (CCR), and the Tamura's features popular in image retrieval. Experimental investigation of the proposed approach was conducted with large large texture databases (e.g. the CUReT database containing more that 200 images for each of 61 natural textured surfaces, MIT Vis Tex database with more than 165 textured images, and Brodatz's texture database with more than 100 images). These experiments confirm effectiveness of our approach for different types of textures. Moreover, the proposed local-to-global texture descriptor can be easily used with different features. This allows for selecting most appropriate pixel-wise features ensuring better performance in each particular application problem relating to single texture segmentation or retrieval.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/918</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Spectroscopic and Conductivity Studies of Doping in Polythiophene and Poly(3,4-Ethylenedioxythiophene) and their Applications as Gas Sensors</field><field name="creator">Chiu, William Wen-Chao</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/920</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Molecular Genetics of Type 2 Diabetes in New Zealand Polynesians</field><field name="creator">Poa, Nicola</field><field name="description">The risk of developing type 2 diabetes is four fold higher in New Zealand(NZ) Polynesians compared to Caucasians. Hence diabetes is more prevalent in Maori (16.5% of the general population) and Pacific Island people (10.1%) compared to NZ Caucasians (9.3%). It is generally accepted that type 2 diabetes has major genetic determinants and heterozygous mutations in a number of genes have previously been identified in some subsets of type 2 diabetes and certain ethnic groups. The high prevalence of diabetes in NZ Polynesians, when compared with NZ Caucasians, after controlling for age, income and body mass index (BMI), suggest that genes may be important in this population. Therefore, the prevalence of allelic variations in the genes encoding amylin and insulin promoter factor-1 (IPF-1), and exon 2 of the hepatocyte nuclear factor-1&#945; (HNF-1&#945;) gene in NZ Polynesians with type 2 diabetes was determined. These genes are known to produce type 2 diabetes in other populations. The genes investigated were screened for mutations by PCR amplification and direct sequencing of promoter regions, exons and adjacent intronic sequences from genomic DNA. DNA was obtained from 146 NZ Polynesians (131 Maori and 15 Pacific Island) with type 2 diabetes and 387 NZ Polynesian non-diabetic control subjects (258 Maori and 129 Pacific Island). Sequences were compared to previously published sequences in the National Centre for Biotechnology Information database. Allelic variations in IPF-1 and exon 2 of the HNF-1&#945; gene were not associated with type 2 diabetes in NZ Polynesians. However, in the amylin gene, two new and one previously described allele was identified in the Maori population including: two alleles in the promoter region (-132G&gt;A and -215T&gt;G), and a missense mutation in exon 3 (QlOR). The -215T&gt;G allele was observed in 5.4% and l% of type 2 diabetic and non-diabetic Maori respectively, and predisposed the carrier to diabetes with a relative risk of 7.23. The -215T&gt;G allele was inherited with a previously described amylin promoter polymorphism(-230A&gt;C) in 3% of Maori with type 2 diabetes, which suggests linkage equilibrium exists between these two alleles. Both Q10R and -132G&gt;A were observed in 0.76% of type 2 diabetic patients and were absent in non-diabetic subjects. Together these allelic variations may account for approximately 7% of type 2 diabetes in Maori. These results suggest that the amylin gene maybe an important candidate marker gene for type 2 diabetes in Maori.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321200 Public Health and Health Services::321207 Indigenous health</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/692</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mujer, Historia Y Sociedad: La Dramaturgia Femenina De La Espana Contempor&#225;nea</field><field name="creator">Zaza, Wendy-Llyn</field><field name="description">This study examines contemporary Spanish women's theatre through three main inseparable themes: woman, history and society. Written from a feminine perspective, the works discussed contest a canonical History which marks the dawning of western civilization. It is then that the Judeo-Christian religion and ancient Greek thought create foundational "sins" which relegate woman to a condition of inferiority. Within a patriarchal structure, she is confined to a private sphere of action. Consequently, a public female presence implies adopting "masculine" values and any possibility of an autobiographical life is thus sacrificed. The woman who dares oppose patriarchal authority becomes, in the context of twentieth-century Spain, a symbol of a people in ideological confrontation with the authorities in power and condemned to a real or figurative death. The prologue to the Civil War is grounded in a conflict of class, with rural areas pitted against central government and proletariat against bourgeoisie. The war itself, together with the postwar period until General Franco's death, constitute an ideological confrontation portrayed through the principal foci of action and from within the prison. The end of the conflict only comes with the restoration of democracy in Spain, a period which coincides with an increasing sociocultural awareness regarding the situation of women. On the one hand, the works analysed reflect this awareness of woman as a class in accordance with Marxist-feminist thought. On the other hand, they are witness to an internal process, which the woman experiences as an individual, and through which she gradually becomes an autonomous subject. The political changes wrought in Spain in 1975 bring about new concerns, arising particularly from irreconcilable differences between the manner in which the country presents itself and its daily reality. The works pertaining to post-Francoist society denounce a resistance to change on the part of State and cultural structures. This study analyses these concerns within the context of sociopolitical hopes and aspirations leading up to the threshold of the twenty-first century.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">es</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/694</field></doc><doc><field name="title">New Zealand Ascidians: Masters of Amino Acid-Derived Secondary Metabolites</field><field name="creator">Pearce, Allison Norrie</field><field name="description">A survey of 34 New Zealand ascidians was performed for the purpose of investigating the biological and chemical properties of ascidians from New Zealand waters. The crude extracts were assayed for biological activity and were also analyzed by HPLC with photodiode array capability for comparison of absorption spectra. In this manner, biological profiles of the cytotoxicity and antimicrobial activities of the crude extracts were obtained, as well as a UV metabolic profile. The (-)-enantiomer of the known compound 1,2,3-trithiane was isolated from the ascidian Hypsistozoa fasmeriana, and the (+)-enantiomer from the ascidian Distaplia stylifera, a member of the same family (Holozoidiae). The (+)-enantiomer was originally isolated from the New Zealand ascidian Aplidium sp.D and appears to be unique to New Zealand waters. A new class of compound, the fasmerianamines A and B, derivatives of 1,2,3-trithiane, were isolate from a second collection of Hypsistozoa fasmeriana. Another new class of metabolite, the fluorescent, biologically inactive distomadines A and B were discovered in the ascidian Pseudodistoma aureum. A previously unknown trimethylated purine, N2,N2,7-trimethylguanine as well as other known purine bases were detected and isolated. Much of the biological activity of the ascidian extracts could be attributed to the presence of unsaturated long-chain amino alcohol-type compounds. The presence of the pyridoacridine class of compound, a large class of aromatic polycyclic alkaloids of worldwide distribution, was detected in a New Zealand ascidian for the first time. The pyridoacridone alkaloid ascididemin possesses a wide range of biological activity and progressed as far as in vivo xenograft antitumoural assays at the NCI, in addition to exhibiting potency against Mycobacterium tuberculosis, revealing its value as a lead compound. The antitumoural activity of ascididemin is attributed to the intercalative ability of its planar pentacyclic structure. The synthetic strategy for another natural pyridoacridone, kuanoniamine A was optimized, and the synthetic compound also showed not only good human solid tumour selectivity, progressing as far as in vivo hollow fibre testing at the NCI, but also potency against Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Three other synthetic ring A-modified analogues were prepared. Two, combining either a furan or a thiophene A ring with a carboxylic acid methyl ester substituent in position two on ring A, were tested at the NCI and were found to be inactive. This indicated that the carboxylic acid methyl ester substituent modification had a detrimental effect on cytotoxicity. The disruption of the planarity of the heterocyclic ring system with subsequent inability to intercalate into DNA might be a factor. An isoxazole ring A-modified analogue was found to be too unstable for evaluation purposes.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/860</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ethnic conflict in Sri Lanka: obstacles to the peace process</field><field name="creator">Edirippulige, Sisira</field><field name="description">The complexity and magnitude of the Sri Lankan conflict have grown over the last five decades, making it one of the most protracted and devastating conflicts in the world today. With the prolongation of conflict, the chances for establishing peace have become distant, the gap between the two communities has widened, and new elements have been introduced to the conflict. The impediments to the establishment of lasting peace on the island encompass both domestic and external factors. Among the large variety of such factors, this study has focused on but a few. The analysis of the domestic factors dwells on the nature of the existing political structure, the characteristics of devolution, and the sources of violence. The examination of the external factors addresses the significance of geopolitics, the role of the Sri Lankan diaspora and the role of the international community. The exploration of the failure of the peace process in the island points to a combination of internal and external factors that impede the establishment of a liberal democratic political structure. Despite its reputation as a Third World democracy, the Sri Lankan polity has, since independence, increasingly developed into an illiberal democracy. Although possessing nominal features of a democracy, the Sri Lankan political system is saturated with highly undemocratic elements. Amongst these elements, the ethnocisation of the society, confrontational politics and violence are specifically addressed by this study. Moreover, this study contends that the deepening ethnic crisis is a direct result of the failure of outside actors to promote democracy in the island. Having been a victim of the Cold War neglect, Sri Lanka's continued isolation in the post Cold War era is largely due to its geopolitical position. Finally, the study identifies the contemporary role of diaspora communities as a severe hindrance to a lasting peace in the country. Apart from material contributions, the divided diaspora communities are a major source of illiberality, and this reflects upon the peace process in various ways. Thus the analysis concludes that lasting peace in the island is possible only through the promotion of genuine liberal democracy, both within and from the outside. Now more than ever before, the new realities of the post-Cold War era provide an atmosphere conducive to such a process.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::360000 Policy and Political Science::360100 Political Science</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/723</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Robert Goodin&#8217;s green theory of value and the politics of fishing and the aquatic environment in New Zealand: an explanation as to how and why fisheries-related policy fails to meet Goodin's public policy and moral criteria for the maintenance of natural resources</field><field name="creator">Pickett, Lance</field><field name="description">The proposition of this thesis is that, policy and legislation pertaining to natural resources, specifically the fisheries and the aquatic environment of New Zealand, do not meet Robert Goodin&#8217;s public policy and moral criteria for successful maintenance of such resources in accordance with his green theory of value. This proposition is derived from an assessment indicating a policy tradition in New Zealand resulting in failure to ensure ecological sustainability in accordance with this country&#8217;s international obligations to biodiversity and futurity. This thesis urges change from the prevailing narrowly economistic political agenda to one based upon Robert Goodin&#8217;s green theory of value. Such a political agenda would be promoted by a third force over and above the traditional parties of the Left and Right, arguably, The Greens: the Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand. The argument for change is based upon an analysis of fisheries related policy and legislation in New Zealand to April 2000. The analysis is organised into successive historical periods, beginning with the arrival of the first Polynesians and ending with the outcome of the 1999 general election. These periods include the development of the common property subsistence fishery of the Maori and its commercial open access Pakeha successors, the institution of an export industry involving in turn delicensing, rationalization, privatization, corporatization, and the process of devolution of fisheries management to industry. It is argued the cumulative outcome is impoverishment of natural resources, the capitalization of Nature and the theft of the &#8220;people&#8217;s right of fishery&#8221;. Goodin&#8217;s green theory of value is carefully stated, developed, analyzed, and compared and contrasted with the prevailing economistic argument. The validity and desirability of the green theory of value and the political agenda to which it gives rise is established. This political agenda is found similar to that of green parties. The political and social milieu in which The Greens must presently operate is analysed. Current environmental policy in general, and fisheries related policies in particular are analysed and found incompatible with Goodin&#8217;s criteria. The outcome of policies and legislation affecting aquatic ecosystems-maintenance is examined in case studies covering major fisheries and the aquatic environment, and found to be generally disastrous.

FFH vegetation is found throughout the Central North Island, in locations where surrounding topography causes cold air to pool on clear, still nights. This increases frost severity and -due to the low frost tolerance of most woody New Zealand plant species - frosts are severe enough to prevent the establishment of most plant species which are common in the surrounding forest vegetation. The majority of work was carried out at four study sites. Rangitaiki is a large (c.2600 ha) remnant of FFH vegetation on a flat, pumice filled, basin. The other three study sites (Tahau, Waione and Pouakani) are much smaller (c.56 ha, c.35 ha, and c.61 ha respectively) basins where cold air is dammed by downstream river gorges. Vegetation change was examined along permanent transects established perpendicular to the FFH/ forest ecotone. Vegetation changed (over l0 - 20m) from a monoculture of Dracophyllum subulatum heathland (= FFH) to more diverse forest or scrub vegetation (= forest). A DCA ordination of the transect data showed that vegetation associations on either side of the ecotone diverged over time. That is, there was a more rapid change in the species composition of vegetation across the FFH/ forest ecotone in older sites. While seed rain density is low in FFH vegetation, it is sufficient, particularly around emergent focal trees, to allow forest to invade FFH. Frost severity increased dramatically across the ecotone in all seasons, at all sites, and the extreme ground frost minimums recorded suggest that it is low temperatures which exclude most forest species from FFH vegetation. Microclimate variation was high at all study sites, and locations with favourable microclimates in FFH vegetation were more likely to support (ephemeral) populations of forest tree seedlings. The most important determinants of variation in microclimate were overhead cover of vegetation and microtopography. The survivorship of 2,270 planted Leptospermum scoparium seedlings - a frost tolerant pioneer species which is important in forest vegetation at all study sites - was examined on transects perpendicular to the ecotone at three study sites. The most important determinant of seedling survivorship was distance from the ecotone, although the distance at which seedling survivorship dropped to zero was site and transect specific. Changes in seedling weight and height growth rate over the study period showed that many seedlings which survived the study period, would not have survived in the long term. There were no significant changes in soil profiles dug along transects perpendicular to the ecotone at all study sites. This suggests that edaphic factors are not the cause of the current ecotone position. The size-age structure of L. scoparium and D. subulatum stems in FFH and forest vegetation was examined using basal disks (n=627) collected on tansects perpendicular to the ecotone. These data suggest that the current ecotone position was set soon after the large scale disturbances which initiated vegetation associations at the four study sites. A short section of the site perimeter at the Waione study site has not been disturbed as recently as the other sites, and age structure data suggests that the ecotone at this location has been stable for at least 100 years. Transect position has no influence on the diameter growth rates of L. scoparium stems, which suggests that it is frost mortality, rather than a growth rate limitation due to lower temperatures, which is preventing this species colonising FFH vegetation. Stem age data also suggested that the scattered L. scoparium shrubs which manage to colonise FFH vegetation are killed by severe irregular climatic events, the most recent of which occurred in the summer of 1972/73. The same events probably also affected the species composition in forests surrounding the FFH study sites. Historical meteorological data suggests the most likely cause of the 1972/73 climatic disturbance was a severe summer drought, combined with a series of moderately severe summer frosts. A severe winter frost in 1978 had no observable effect on indigenous vegetation at the four study sites. The restricted distribution of two key cold tolerant indigenous woody species - due to increased fire frequency - has almost certainly resulted in a longer term dominance of some sites by FFH vegetation. Phyllocladus alpinus (not present at any of the study sites) and Halocarpus bidwilli (very restricted distribution at one study site only) have cold tolerances and life history characteristics that allow them to invade FFH. The preceeding results suggest that the composition and structure of both FFH, and surrounding forest vegetation, is a direct result of the unique abiotic environment and vegetation history of each site. Protecting vegetation covering the widest possible range of variation in edaphic and environmental conditions should therefore ensure greatest variation in different plant communities, and genotypes of different plant species, is conserved. The ecotone transitions studied in this thesis are clearly identifiable, and appear to represent the true distributional limits of most indigenous woody forest species. FFH/ forest ecotones may therefore be useful as sites for monitoring the future effects of climate change on plant communities. The varied responses of vegetation at the four study sites to the 1972/73 climatic event suggests that monitoring transects should be established at as many different sites as possible, and at different locations within each study site.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/797</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Plankton of the Hauraki Gulf</field><field name="creator">Jillett, John B.

However, the management of skid resistance of road surfacings continues to be difficult due to the inherent and sometimes random variation in skid resistance levels over time.  This study is an investigation and analysis of seasonal and short term variation of measured skid resistance in two phases.  Phase 1: Regular field monitoring was undertaken using the GripTester and the Dynamic Friction Tester measurement devices on seven sites in the Auckland and Northland Regions of New Zealand was undertaken over a three year period.  The effects of temperature, rainfall, contaminants, new surfacings, geometric elements and aggregate properties were analysed to investigate factors that initiate changes in the measured skid resistance of pavement surfacings.  Phase 2: Laboratory prepared samples were constructed for accelerated polishing and skid resistance testing of four different aggregates (two greywackes, a basalt and an artificial iron-making melter slag aggregate).  The samples were polished in an accelerated polishing machine to an &#8216;equilibrium skid resistance&#8217; level (Stage 1 polishing).  Contaminants were then added to the accelerated polishing process to determine the effect of varying additive, particle size and hardness in an attempt to simulate seasonal and/or short-term variations that occur in the field.  The results have demonstrated that significant and previously unpredictable variations (greater than 30%) in measured skid resistance can occur over short time periods.  These variations cannot be explained by any one factor. They are the result of a number of inter-related factors, including the geological properties of the aggregates and the contaminants themselves, the previous rainfall history, the road geometry, the calendar month of the year and (depending upon the measurement device), the temperature during testing.  The laboratory tests demonstrate that accelerated polishing tests of aggregate samples could be prepared for testing by the Dynamic Friction Tester and that significant variations in measured skid resistance could be simulated on various aggregates in the laboratory by the addition of contaminants.  The results of the testing and addition of contaminants on various aggregates resulted in significant behavioural differences which were related to the geological properties of the aggregates themselves, as well as the contaminants used in the accelerated polishing process. The findings of the research have specific relevance to three areas of industry; Road Controlling Authorities who are primarily interested in skid resistance policy, standards and management,  Road Asset Managers who operate, maintain and manage condition level and the safety aspects of the road network and Crash Investigators who collect and analyse crash data primarily for legal proceedings. All three of these industry organisations need to clearly understand the inherent variability of skid resistance, the factors involved and the effects that geological and environmental variations have on skid resistance measurement.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Skid resistance, Road safety, Surfacing aggregates, Vehicle / tyre friction, Detritus</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1432</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Surrealism: the spirit and the letter in twentieth-century English poetry</field><field name="creator">Jackaman, Robert, 1945-</field><field name="description">Surrealism is dead.

With a continual decline in the abundance of whitebait species, additional knowledge on factors affecting galaxiid populations is crucial. This thesis examines the use of olfactory and lateral line sensory systems in the biology of banded kokopu as both adults and juveniles (whitebait). The feeding biology of banded kokopu adults was investigated through olfactory source localisation. In the presence of a 2 cm s-1 current flow, fish used both olfaction and the superficial neuromasts of the lateral line system to locate the food source. A physical block of one olfactory nostril did not affect the olfactory search strategy employed by banded kokopu. Banded kokopu whitebait were tested for their response to adult galaxiid odours. Migratory whitebait exhibited a species-specific attraction to adult conspecifics. There was no response shown to odours from adults of other galaxiid species, the inanga (G. maculatus) or koaro (G. brevipinnis) at any concentration tested. This pheromonal attraction may play an important role in habitat selection during migration. The effect of poor water quality on sensory performance was also investigated. After exposure to 0.5 &#181;g Cd2+ l-l for 48 hours, the attraction to adult pheromones had been eliminated, indicating this level of cadmium exposure had impaired olfactory function. The lateral line system was not blocked until a concentration of 2 &#181;g Cd2+l-1. Whitebait were also tested for a preference/avoidance response at2 &#181;g Cd2+ l-l and showed neither a preference for, or an avoidance of, a concentration which would disable both the lateral line and olfactory sensory systems. This concentration is within the current water quality criteria for protection of aquatic life. The disabling of these sensory systems may render migratory cues undetectable, affecting habitat selection by whitebait, which may ultimately affect the distribution of banded kokopu populations. This thesis furthers our understanding of the mechanisms of migration and feeding in banded kokopu. The use of both the lateral line and olfactory sensory systems in the location of food odours by adult fish provides the first demonstration of the use of the lateral line system in olfactory source localisation in fish. The importance of water quality in the detection of possible migratory cues has been illustrated with cadmium, where inhibition of sensory systems rendered pheromonal cues undetectable. The pheromonal attraction exhibited by whitebait to adults provides a possible migratory cue used by whitebait in locating habitat for colonisation. The identification of a migratory cue could help in the conservation of banded kokopu populations and in the management of New Zealand's whitebait fishery.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1418</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Intermolecular interactions in aqueous binary mixtures of non-electrolytes</field><field name="creator">Keronei, Pius Kipkemboi</field><field name="description">The density and shear viscosity of mixtures of tert-Butyl alcohol (ButOH) and tert-Butylamine (ButNH2) with water have been determined for various temperatures (288.15 K to 318.15 K for H2O+ButOH and 288.15 K to 308.15 K for H2O+ButNH2) over the whole composition range. Excess molar volumes and apparent molar volumes of the components of each system were calculated from the density data. In both systems the apparent molar volume of the organic component passes through a minimum in the water-rich region. Both systems exhibit large negative excess molar volumes which are essentially independent of temperature at all compositions. The two systems show pronounced maxima in their shear viscosity isotherms. The empirical solvent polarity parameters ENR and ET for the solvatochromic compounds Nile Red and pyridinium-N-phenoxide betaine respectively, have been determined as a function of composition for water + tert-Butyl alcohol and water + tert-Butylamine binary mixtures, over the whole composition range at 298.15 K. For both systems the two parameters vary with composition in a strongly nonlinear fashion, and the polarity of the mixture decreases with increasing proportion of the organic cosolvent. The nonlinear variation of the polarity parameters is attributed to water-cosolvent hydrophobic interactions at low cosolvent contents, and hydrogen bonding interactions at higher cosolvent contents. Permittivity and refractive index have also been measured at 298.15 K for both systems, and both properties are strongly nonlinear functions of composition. The self-diffusion coefficients of water and of the organic component have been measured for H2O+t-butyl alcohol and H2O+t-butylamine mixtures over the whole composition range at 301.15 K, using the NMR spin-echo technique. In the water-rich region below 20 mole % of cosolvent, the self-diffusion coefficients of both components for each binary solvent system decrease rapidly with increasing cosolvent content. In cosolvent-rich mixtures with more than 50 mole % cosolvent, motions of water are evidently strongly correlated with those of cosolvent molecules. The semiempirical equation proposed by Albright relating the shear viscosity of a mixture to the diffusion coefficients of its components successfully predicts the general shape of the viscosity curve for each binary system. For the composition region above 50 mole % cosolvent the Albright equation gives calculated viscosities which agree well with observed values, but in the water-rich region there are significant deviations between the observed and calculated viscosities. Volume ratios have been measured with a bellows volumometer for t-Butylamine and six water + t-Butylamine mixtures at 278.15, 288.15, 298.15 and 313.15 K, at pressures up to about 200 MPa or at a lower pressure slightly below the freezing pressure at the temperature of measurement. From densities measured at 0.1 MPa together with the volume ratios at higher pressures, excess molar volumes, and isothermal compressibilities have been evaluated. The compressibility is a relatively simple function of pressure, temperature, and composition. Hydroxyl-proton chemical shifts for water and t-Butyl alcohol in water + t-Butyl alcohol mixtures with &#8805;8 mol% t-Butyl alcohol, and the averaged hydroxyl and amino proton chemical shift for water + t-Butylamine mixtures, have been determined at 200 MHz for four temperatures (263.15, 278.15, 298.15 and 313.15 K) as a function of composition. Further measurements have been made for water + t-Butyl alcohol + t-Butylamine ternary mixtures at 310.15 K over the complete mole fraction range at 60 MHz. Variations in solvent composition have little effect on the resonance for the methyl protons of the cosolvent, but the signal for the hydroxylic protons is substantially influenced. The water proton resonance initially shifts to higher frequencies (low fields) as the cosolvent is added to water, and the shift to higher frequency in the water proton resonance induced by the hydrophobic cosolvent is strongly temperature dependent, the effect being greatly enhanced at lower temperatures. As the proportion of cosolvent increases the hydroxyl proton signals in the water + t-Butyl alcohol system and the averaged proton signal in water + t-Butylamine mixtures shift to lower frequency (high field). Raman and FT-IR absorption spectra of aqueous t-Butyl alcohol and t-Butylamine in the region of O-H and NH2 stretching and bending modes have been measured at 298.15 K as a function of organic cosolvent concentration in the whole cosolvent mole fraction region. Vibrational intensities of some bands show definite trends with varying concentrations of the solutions. In the concentration dependence study unusual linewidth changes of certain bands were observed. Conductivities, densities and viscosity B-coefficients from the Jones-Dole equation were determined for NaI, KI, Bu4NI, LiCl and KCl at 298.15 K in various mixtures of water with t-Butyl alcohol and t-Butylamine. The limiting molar conductances and the corresponding Walden products have been computed. Values of the partial molar volumes of the electrolytes at infinite dilution in the various solvent mixtures were obtained from the density measurements.</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/973</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cooperative breeding in the skuas of the Chatham Islands</field><field name="creator">Hemmings, Alan Dudley</field><field name="description">Cooperative breeding, widely reported in birds, is found in &lt;1&#8211;5% of territories in some populations of the Brown skua, Catharacta lonnbergi. In the New Zealand region, up to 30-50% of skua territories may be occupied by trios or larger groups. This study examines its occurrence at the Chatham Islands, east of New Zealand. Here 16% of territories are occupied by trios and 2% by groups. All members of skua trios and groups participate in sexual and other breeding activity, and the associations arc thus communal. Sexual discrimination of breeding birds by morphometric measurements shows that all communal groups known since 1978-79 have been polyandrous. These groups are long-lived associations, some of which are known to have persisted for at least 14 years. Trios are as long-lived and stable as pairs, and birds on communal territories do not move from them even when an appropriate-sex space becomes available on an adjacent pair territory. The members of trios are not close kin. All members of communal associations participate in territorial defence and chick rearing. In trios, the males appear to be equals, although in any one year the actual paternity of offspring may reside with only one of them. Overall reproductive success for Chatham Island skuas is high, for both pairs and communal groups, compared with other populations. However, communal trios and groups have lower reproductive success than pairs even over a l0 year period, particularly when considered on a per adult basis. Furthermore, no improvement in chick &#8216;quality&#8217; is discernible. Unusually for skuas, the breeding population at the Chatham Islands is non-migratory. Skuas are present on their breeding territories during the winter, and exhibit characteristic territorial and agonistic behaviours, albeit at lower intensity than during the breeding season. It is suggested that communal breeding in this skua population is not adaptive per se, but a secondary consequence of year-round residence. This is a departure from the conventional resolution of communal breeding. Residence is facilitated by benign climatic conditions and year-round prey availability. When territory space becomes available outside the breeding season, in a small number of cases more than a pair of skuas are able to establish themselves. Thereafter, trios and larger groups persist and behave in the same manner as pairs. The flux between trios and pairs when birds are lost is determined, in part, by the sex of that bird. Thus a trio which loses its one female will &#8216;acquire&#8217; a replacement female and persist as a trio, whereas a trio which loses one of its two males will thereafter continue as a pair.

During the winter months the sea around the coast of Antarctica freezes to form a vast area of ice covered region. The ice sheets found in this area are often large and apparently featureless. From these properties, a large scale sea-ice sheet has been modelled as a homogeneous thin elastic plate with a constant Young's modulus when the deformation of the ice sheet is small. A partial differential equation describing the motion of an ice sheet is de-rived from the classical theory of linear elasticity. A well known system of partial differential equations is derived to describe the vertical deflection of a thin elastic plate coupled with a linearized Bernoulli's equation at the surface and Laplace's equation for incompressible fluid of finite depth. The Fourier transform is used to derive the vertical deflection of the ice sheet when a localized time harmonic vertical load is applied. A fundamental solution can be expressed by infinite summations of fractional functions at complex roots of the dispersion equation. The inverse Fourier transform is calculated by hand using the Hankel transform and the resulting formulae are directly turned into numerically stable computer codes without any modification. It is shown from the finite water depth solution, that the infinite series expansion of the deflection can be reduced to a sum of special functions whose modes are three roots of a fifth order polynomial. Furthermore, the space and time variables are non-dimensionalized using a characteristic length and characteristic time which are determined by the thickness and Young's modulus of the ice sheet. As a consequence of the non-dimensionalization, the solutions are insensitive to the ice thickness and categorized according to distinctive physical characteristics. It is conversely shown that the characteristic length and characteristic time can be measured from direct observations of the flexural motion, such as the surface strain or tilt, of the ice sheet. Interaction between two semi-infinite ice sheets that are joined by a straight infinite line transition is considered. When a plane wave is obliquely incident on the transition, reflection and transmission of wave energy occurs. Analytical formulae for the coefficients of a modal expansion of the waves in the ice sheet are derived using the Wiener-Hopf technique and formulae for the reflection and transmission coefficients of the surface waves are also presented. The formulae are directly turned into stable computer codes. The application of the Wiener-Hopf technique given here is modified from a standard method to accommodate the incident wave from infinity better. A set of physical conditions at the transition can be expressed using a pair of 4 x 4 matrix and 4-element vector, whose elements are computed from the coefficients of the modal expansion of the solutions. Hence the solution procedure is able to cope with various transition conditions simply by changing the matrix and the vector. Modelling of finite ice sheets using the boundary integral equation method is also considered. Formulation of boundary integral equations is given and it is shown that the dynamics of the ice sheet is represented by the boundary integrals only on the edge of the ice sheet. Connection between the Wiener-Hopf technique and boundary integral method is made.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1097</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Learning to cross borders: everyday urban encounters between South Korea and Auckland</field><field name="creator">Collins, Francis Leo</field><field name="description">This thesis examines aspects of emergent transnational mobility within the experience of students advancing their education at tertiary institutions, private training establishments and language schools. In particular it focuses on the everyday practices and experiences of one group of international students from South Korea during their time in Auckland, New Zealand. The context for the research is that over the last decade the growth of international students and the institutions associated with their movement and education have begun to have significant economic, social and cultural implications in New Zealand, particularly in Auckland. Here, the rapid increase in the number and proportion of students from three East-Asian nations (China, South Korea and Japan) has contributed to profound changes in the socio-cultural geographies of Auckland&#8217;s central city.  The aim of this study is to interrogate the everyday urban encounters of South Korean international students as a means to more deeply understand the phenomenon of crossing borders to learn. I employ a multi-method and multi-sited research approach that draws on both orthodox and emergent techniques within human geography and related social sciences. Through these methods I focus on the individual and collective practices and experiences of these students as key actors in the developments associated with international education. At all times the focus is on &#8216;the everyday&#8217; and the ways in which students negotiate their encounters between South Korea and Auckland. In theoretical terms the thesis is situated at the border between the study of transnationalism and the study of cities. It identifies the ways that the transnational mobility and activity of students alongside others is involved in the changing spaces of Auckland&#8217;s urban landscape. These changed spaces include physical, economic, sensory and perceptual landscapes of the city. In addition the thesis also illustrates the concurrent production, maintenance and resistance of pre-existing and new identities; the often difficult, highly structured and uneven landscape that emerges as a result of the interaction between individuals and groups who consider each-other &#8216;foreign&#8217;; and the way that these types of interactions in contemporary cities are facilitated by but also maintain and produce increasing transnationalism. The thesis concludes by illustrating the fundamental role that cities play in the practice of international education and the resulting importance of international education to the everyday realities of contemporary cities like Auckland.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">International Education</field><field name="subject">International Students</field><field name="subject">Geography</field><field name="subject">Auckland</field><field name="subject">Transnationalism</field><field name="subject">South Korea</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2252</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Marine reserves and the spiny lobster, Jasus edwardsii</field><field name="creator">Kelly, Shane</field><field name="description">The impact of no-take marine reserves on spiny lobster, Jasus edwardsii, populations and the adjacent lobster fishery was assessed in a study that determined: the response of lobster populations to protection, if lobsters within marine reserves moved out into the surrounding fishery, examined the behavioural characteristic of lobsters that contributed to their recovery and spillover, and contrasted catch characteristics around a north-east New Zealand marine reserve with 2 unprotected sites. Surveys of 4 no-take marine reserves of different ages and 4 unprotected control sites confirmed that J. edwardsii increase in mean size and abundance within protected areas. Total lobster density was estimated to increase by 6.1% per year of protection. The relationship between age of reserve and the density of lobsters above the legal size limit (&gt;100 mm carapace length) was complicated by depth related interactions between reserves, due to seasonal changes in the depth distribution of lobsters and differences in the timing of surveys among locations. However, density increases in legal sized lobsters were greater than those of the overall population. Mean size of protected lobsters increased in a non-linear fashion, reflecting the asymptotic growth characteristics of the species. Mean carapace length of lobsters increased by 11.24 mm after 3 years of protection and only by 16.25 mm after 2l years of protection. Corresponding increases in biomass (kg.500 m-2) and egg production (eggs.500 m-2) were estimated to be 7.4% and 6.6% respectively per year of protection. A tag recapture program indicated that the limited scale of movements and relatively high site fidelity of mature J. edwardsii aided the recovery of lobster populations in protected areas. Of 737 lobsters tagged in and around the Leigh Marine Reserve,212 were subsequently resighted. Seventy percent of resighted lobsters were relocated less than 250 m along the shore from their initial site after a mean period of liberty of 146 (se = 13.42) days. However, seasonal offshore movements took lobsters beyond the seaward boundary of the reserve where they were susceptible to capture. Of the 521 lobsters tagged on inshore reefs within the Leigh Marine Reserve. l.9% were caught over the seaward boundary by commercial fishers, and 14.4% of the 181 lobsters tagged over the seaward boundary were resighted on inshore reefs within the reserve. Movements into or out of the reserve across the longshore boundaries were also recorded for 7 out of the 27 lobsters moving further than 250 m along the shore. Acoustic tracking confirmed that J. edwardsii have a high site fidelity, with tracked lobsters spending a median of 84% of their time at their home site. Twenty one percent of the 26 lobsters fitted with acoustic tags never left their tagging site and, of those that did leave 56% eventually returned. Lobsters moved up to 3.1km away from their home sites but managed to find their way back after periods of 1 to 103 days away. Five lobsters had strong associations with two separate sites and made repeated movements between these alternate home sites. The straight line distance between alternate home sites ranged from 200 m to 1.3 km, and the period between visits to their primary or secondary home sites ranged from 1 to 93 days. Movement activity varied throughout the year, and seasonal patterns differed between males and females. Females displayed one peak in movement activity per year, around the time of larval release in September-October. Males displayed a summer peak centred on January, and a winter peak centred on July. The onset of high movement activity was often accompanied by a shift to deeper water and l0 of the 14 lobsters tracked for over 6 months spent periods away from the inshore reef system. Exposed groups of lobsters were observed aggregating in offshore areas of sand and low lying patch reef during the day. Offshore aggregations were observed over 7 months of the year and lobsters within the aggregations displayed behaviour consistent with the use of mutual defence. The sexual composition of the aggregations reflected seasonal patterns in male and female movement rates. Male J. edwardsii dominated the aggregations in winter and summer; times when peak feeding rates of males held in captivity were also recorded. Females dominated the offshore aggregations in September-October when larvae are released. Seven of the 26 lobsters fitted with acoustic tags moved over the boundaries of the Leigh Marine Reserve and Tawharanui Marine Park during offshore movements. Despite the fact that there is no fishing access to inshore reefs within the Leigh Marine Reserve, no significant difference was detected between the catch per unit effort (kg.trap haul-1) of lobsters caught around the reserve, nearby coastal Leigh or Little Barrier Island. However, catches around the marine reserve contained fewer (P=0.0009) but larger lobsters than at Little Barrier Island. The catch characteristics of lobsters from coastal Leigh were intermediate between the other two sites. As access to inshore reefs around the Leigh Marine Reserve was limited to a small area at either end of the reserve, traps tended to be set in offshore locations and the sexual composition of the total catch around the Leigh Marine Reserve reflected the seasonal movements of males and females into, and out, offshore areas. At coastal Leigh and Little Barrier Island the location of traps was not restricted and greater use was made of coastal fringing reefs. As a result the sexual composition of the catch at these locations did not reflect the movement of various components of the lobster population into and out of specific habitats or locations. Overall, the results of this study suggest that relatively small (~ 5 km2) no-take marine reserves increase lobster biomass and egg production, without adversely affecting catch rates in the surrounding fishery. Marine reserves may therefore represent a viable management tool, which if used in conjunction with other management regimes, could provide a more precautionary approach to the management of the J. edwardsii fishery at minimal cost to the industry.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270700 Ecology and Evolution::270702 Marine and estuarine ecology (incl. marine ichthyology)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/995</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ensemble learning by data resampling</field><field name="creator">Goebel, Michael</field><field name="description">We investigate ensemble learning methods that construct a classifier ensemble by repeatedly sampling the original training data and building a member classifier from each subsample. We find that the performance of standard Bagging can frequently be improved upon by simple variations of the sampling scheme, such as varying the sample size, or sampling without replacement instead of sampling with replacement. For all methods tested, the ensemble performance is greatly dependent on properties of the problem domain and the data sample. We try to explain the observed performances of the various ensemble methods qualitatively and quantitatively, and find that current ensemble analysis methods such as margin distributions, Error diagrams, bias-variance decomposition etc. are not well suited for this task. We postulate that the primary explanation for the performance of ensemble methods is to be found in their effects on accuracy of the ensemble members on one side and diversity among them on the other side, two contradictory goals which necessitate a compromise, or trade-off. This motivates the presentation of a precise yet general definition of what diversity is and how it is to be measured. This definition has the desirable property that it is applicable to all single-stage voting ensembles, under any given loss function. We then study the mathematical relationships between ensemble loss, mean member loss, and diversity. For squared loss, we show that our definitions lead to the well known ensemble loss decomposition, and extend this decomposition to the case where the ensemble members, instead of a real number, return a probability distribution over R. For the case of 0-1 loss, we derive the exact mathematical relations between ensemble loss, mean member loss, and diversity. Studying those relations provides some valuable insights into ensembles behavior, and produces some unexpected hence interesting results. These results are also confirmed by the experimental observations. Turning our attention back to the performance of Bagging variants, we show how the loss decomposition can be used to reduce the number of parameter settings which have to be tried out experimentally in order to find a well-performing ensemble method for a given particular problem.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/996</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Non-ICT executive perceptions of, and attitudes towards, ICT infrastructure projects : do they influence the outcomes of such projects</field><field name="creator">Reid, Gillian Anne</field><field name="description">There are many issues involved in implementing Information and Communications Technology (ICT) projects in general, and infrastructure (ICT/I) projects in particular.  Failures are still common despite advances in project management tools, and increased ICT sophistication.  Executive sponsorship and support is acknowledged to make a difference to the success or failure of these kinds of projects. Little has been written on the views of non-ICT executives about the issues they have with ICT/I projects, which have particular challenges because of their highly technical nature.  This research sought to develop a theory not only about what the issues are, from the non-ICT executive perspective, but also how these issues appear in, and may affect the outcomes of, such projects. An interpretive study using single units of analysis within multiple cases, to build an inductively derived theory, was the approach chosen for this research. An adapted grounded theory analysis, following the original Glaser and Strauss (1967) philosophy, was used to analyse data extracted from interviews with fifteen chief executives or equivalents.  Three themes arose out of this process: Executive Perceptions of ICT/I;	Strategic Alignment of ICT/I projects;ICT/I Project Outcomes  The themes had quite strong connections between them.  Jargon Barriers between ICT staff and these executives, affected the executives perceptions of ICT/I and were strong contributing factors for a poor strategic alignment between ICT/I projects and business goals. The poor alignment was primarily caused as a result of low levels of executive engagement with these projects, because they couldn&#8217;t understand the &#8220;techno-speak&#8221; of their ICT people.  The consequence was consistently low satisfaction with ICT/I project life cycle outcomes. There was a very real difference between the satisfaction levels of executives who had made definite efforts to overcome, or deal with, the ICT/I jargon barriers, and those who hadn&#8217;t.   there was a very real difference between the satisfaction levels of executives who had made definite efforts to overcome, or deal with, the ICT/I jargon barriers, and those who hadn&#8217;t.  The substantive theory developed from this work is that: Jargon barriers created by ICT staff generate poor relationships between ICT staff and their executives, which in turn can cause low levels of executive engagement with their infrastructure projects, and consequently affect executive perceptions about the outcomes of these projects.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ICT Infrastructure Projects</field><field name="subject">Executive perceptions &amp; attitudes towards ICT</field><field name="subject">Grounded Theory data analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1656</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reading Lapita in near Oceania : intertidal and shallow-water pottery scatters, Roviana Lagoon, New Georgia, Solomon Islands</field><field name="creator">Felgate, Matthew Walter</field><field name="description">Lapita is the name given by archaeologists to a material culture complex distributed from Papua New Guinea to Samoa about 3000 years ago, which marks major economic changes in Near Oceania and the first settlement by humans of Remote Oceania. Those parts of Solomon Islands that lie in Near Oceania, together with Bougainville, comprise a large gap in the recorded distribution of Lapita, which the current research seeks to explain. At Roviana Lagoon, centrally located in this gap, scatters of pottery, stone artefacts, and other stone items are found in shallow water in this sheltered, landlocked lagoon, initially thought to be late derivatives of Lapita. This research seeks method and theory to aid in the interpretation of this type of archaeological record. Intensive littoral survey discovered a wider chronological range of pottery styles than had previously been recorded, including materials attributable directly to the Lapita material culture complex. A study of vessel brokenness and completeness enabled sample evaluation, estimation of a parent population from which the sample derived, assessment of the state of preservation of the sample, and systematic choice of unit of quantification. Studies of wave exposure of collection sites and taphonomic evidence from sherds concluded that the cultural formation process of these sites was stilt house settlement (as found elsewhere in Near Oceania for Lapita) over deeper water than today. Falling relative sea levels and consequent increasing effects of swash-zone processes have resulted in high archaeological visibility and poor state of preservation at Roviana Lagoon. Analysis of ceramic and lithic variability and spatial analysis allowed the construction of a provisional chronology in need of further testing. Indications are that there is good potential to construct a robust, high-resolution ceramic chronology by focussing on carefully controlled surface collection from this sort of location, ceramic seriation and testing/calibration using direct dating by AMS radiocarbon and Thermoluminescence. Data on preservation and archaeological visibility of stilt house settlements along a sheltered emerging coastline allows preservation and visibility for this type of settlement to be modeled elsewhere. When such a model is applied to other areas of the Lapita gap, which are predominantly either less favourable for preservation or less favourable for archaeological visibility, the gap in the distribution of Lapita can be seen to be an area of low probability of detection by archaeologists, meaning there is currently no evidence for absence of settlement in the past, and good reason to think that Lapita was continuously distributed across Near Oceania as a network of stilt village settlement. This finding highlights the need for explicit models of probability of detection to discover or read the Lapita archaeological record.

Fairburn (1904-1957)</field><field name="creator">Trussell, Denys John</field><field name="description">This thesis is a literary biography. It incorporates material that is often outside the scope of scholarly or academic writing: the detail of an individual's day-to-day life. It also spans several disciplines: the fine arts, their history and theory, literary history and criticism, ecology, philosophy, classical music and general history. The discussion involved these because the biographical subject had an active interest at times an active involvement in them. There has been an attempt to follow through themes and patterns that were enduring in the life of A.R.D. Fairburn. He is shown as a man who saw the world in vitalistic and metaphysical terms, rather than in terms of their opposites &#8211; mechanism and materialism. These views he represented consistently in a secular society that had a predominantly scientific world view. He is treated as a Romantic/Modernist where his poetry is discussed, and as a pivotal figure in New Zealand's literary history; one who helped make the transition from Victorian, Edwardian and Georgian poetic idioms to those of a regional Modernism, within which he developed a unique style. The biography has implicit in it an 'argument', though not one that is developed in an abstract way: namely that Fairburn, his grandfather Edwin and his great-grandfather, William, were peculiarly representative figures in our history. Their active New Zealand presence lasts from l8l9-1957. Two of them played direct roles in establishing a settler culture here; the third was acutely aware of the tensions and contradictions of that culture. Though A.R.D. and Edwin Fairburn were eccentric in the social milieu of New Zealand, their lives touched it in so many ways that they, along with their missionary forebear, William Thomas Fairburn, are personifications in an historical narrative. The line of their lives traces much in the history of the country since the early nineteenth century.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420200 Literature Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1010</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Bolshie Women: Resisting State Reform in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Bedggood, Janet Lindsay</field><field name="description">This thesis looks at the way the historical oppression of women in capitalist society is reproduced through a continuing gender division of labour at home and in the workplace. Women's primary responsibility for domestic labour in the home both defines and disadvantages them in the labour market. I argue that changing women's inferior status under capitalism depends on women organising for equality in the labour market. I develop the argument around women's status by looking at the way state activity shaped the conditions for social reproduction in the post-war period of capitalist growth followed by the onset of economic decline and state restructuring in New Zealand. I take a classical Marxist political economy approach to explain the end of the post-war boom as a 'structural crisis' of falling profits requiring the state to act for capital by establishing the conditions for the market to 'restructure' production to restore the conditions for profitability. The thesis focuses on the reduction of state welfare provision which impacted on women both as domestic labourers and wage labourers. These measures generated opposition. First, government's proposal for domestic purpose beneficiaries to undertake 'workfare' signaled a (failed) attempt to propel these women into work as a reserve army of labour and out of their primary role as domestic labourers supported by the state. Second, reducing state spending on the 'social wage' impacted directly on women workers in state sector areas of education and health. I interviewed women teachers who were active in their unions in resisting the pressures of reform and defending their jobs. The most politically conscious teachers were Marxists who agitated to advance workers from a trade union consciousness to a class consciousness. They understood that the union struggle was a class struggle of workers against a capitalist class on the offensive. They challenged union bureaucrats in accommodating to this. In their interventions, these women demonstrated the possibilities for overcoming gender inequality not through separatist strategies or liberal reforms that leave capitalist structures intact but through the transformative potential of union struggle for the 'socialist project'.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370100 Sociology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1021</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Career Communities</field><field name="creator">Parker, Heather Lynette Polly</field><field name="description">Careers link the inner, subjective, world of self with the outer, objective, world of institutions and society. As society increasingly reflects turbulence and fragmentation, people may still seek the sense of community that the old career arrangements were expected to provide. Taking inspiration from "new science" ideas of self-organising, and "intelligent career" ideas of individual learning, this thesis posits a new concept of "career communities". These are presented as an alternative organising structure through which the inter-dependence of career experiences and the environment in which they unfold is recognised. The thesis is focused around three questions. The first question relates to the application of intelligent career theory at a group level of analysis. Its exploration links three intelligent career "ways of knowing' to recent conceptions of communal learning. The second question concerns enhancing our understanding of career growth through career communities, and the learning and social opportunities these communities provide. The third question - in keeping with the tenets of new science - asks how career communities function as attractors in the way careers self-organise into collective work arrangements. The methodology adopted in this research advances an explicit theoretical connection between the (individual) subjective and (communal) inter-subjective worlds. The approach begins with an application of the 'intelligent career card sort' (ICCS) which elicits data on an individuals' subjective career according to three interdependent "ways of knowing". The results for the career community under consideration are then aggregated to provide input data for the elicitation of inter-subjective meaning through focus group discussions. This data is then analysed by reference to a typology of ten "pure types" of career community developed as part of this thesis. The thesis comprises four empirical studies. A preliminary pilot study of management consultants was conducted to ascertain the appropriateness of the methodology. Study#1 involved all workers in a non-for-profit organisation focused on rehabilitation of victims of sexual abuse. This group was expected to hold a strong ideological attachment to the work they performed. Study#2 involved Leased Executives, selected to represent the growing proportion of people experiencing contingency employment, and also because of their apparently high sense of professionalism in their work. Study#3 involved a group of Pacific Island professionals, predominantly from the public sector. This group was selected because they represent an ethnic minority whose cultural traditions are inherently collective rather than individual in orientation. The results communicate the inter-subjective meanings elicited at the group level of analysis. The patterns, which emerged from the interplay among the three ways of knowing, were analysed according to the typology of career communities previously developed. Each empirical study showed that in reality a hybrid of career community types was evident rather than any pure type. A comparison across the groups illustrates the principal differences among the groups in the career issues that they faced. The results provide support for the concept of career communities as an alternative organising principle behind people's careers, and one that extends beyond any single employment setting.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1029</field></doc><doc><field name="title">New Zealand friendly societies, 1842-1941</field><field name="creator">Carlyon, Jenny,1951-</field><field name="description">This thesis studies Friendly Societies of New Zealand from 1842, when the first lodge was established, to l94l when the Social Security Amendment Bill, allowing for the implementation of the general medical benefit, was enacted. It is the study of how, through the formation of mutual aid societies, a significant group of working people protected themselves against hardship. At the same time, it is the study of how Friendly Societies, by means of social activity and ritual, bonded their members together and synthesised their welfare role with the values of respectability, thrift and independence. The establishment of lodges throughout the nineteenth century is explored and it is shown how lodges, as well as providing for their members' welfare needs, were also effective community institutions of social integration, facilitating the adaptation of immigrants to their new environment. By the twentieth century very few New Zealand settlements were without a lodge. As an integral part of their communities, they were cross-class institutions, drawing together and mixing people from different classes, occupations and social groups. Traced also is the transformation of Friendly Societies from small, financially insecure, local lodges, combining conviviality with limited welfare benefits, to the large financially sound consolidated Societies of the 1930s providing their members with access to modem health care. Effective insurance became the primary focus of Friendly Societies. Although social life remained active, as the twentieth Century progressed, people increasingly joined lodges only for the health and medical benefits offered. Because of their wide range of benefits and because there was little else in the way of welfare relief at the time, Friendly Societies were relevant and significant suppliers of welfare. The state recognised this role and supported them with legislation and help, at least until 1910. However, as the state increasingly ventured into the welfare arena its support for the Societies waned, until finally friendly Society sickness benefits were replaced by the 1938 Social Security Act and their medical benefits by the Social Security Amendment Act of 1941. Friendly Societies were sidelined. Because welfare historiography has tended to focus on the state, it has neglected Friendly Societies. This study intends to redress the balance, and show that welfare did not start with tie state - that many people were making effective provision against sickness, disability and death for themselves long before the introduction of the welfare state.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::430000 History and Archaeology::430100 Historical Studies::430101 History: New Zealand</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1033</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Transhumanism and the imago Dei: narratives of apprehension and hope</field><field name="creator">Garner, Stephen Robert</field><field name="description">The development of emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence and virtual reality generate narratives of apprehension within contemporary Western technoculture. Transhumanist narratives declare that humanity is now upon the brink of seizing technological control of its own evolution, and creating a brighter and better posthuman future. For many, this leads to human technological capability being seen with both a sense of wonder at its potential, and a sense of dread of that same potential. Theologically, this raises two key questions: Firstly, why are human beings technological? Secondly, how should human technological agency be pursued? In this thesis, the motif of the imago Dei, the theological assertion that human beings are somehow made in the image and likeness of God, is employed to explore technological narratives of apprehension, and to answer these key questions. It is argued that the imago Dei, interpreted through the metaphor of the created co-creator, provides significant insight into the question of human technological inclination. The created co-creator, as a metaphor of hybridity, also intersects with similar transhumanist visions of the hybrid or cyborg, where the boundary between human persons and technology is ambiguous. Such visions of the hybrid prove disconcerting, for they blur traditional categories used to organise the world. Moreover, such visions also comprise elements of technological eschatology that provide meaning and hope, and stand in possible conflict with theological equivalents. The thesis concludes by considering how the metaphor of the created co-creator can draw upon the richness of the Christian traditions of social concern and hybridity to engender narratives of hope. These new narratives enlarge upon the theological understanding of human technological creativity and purpose to supplement the narratives of apprehension. In doing so, they provide impetus for wholesome and hopeful technological agency.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2251</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cellular trafficking of rotavirus NSP4 in epithelial cells</field><field name="creator">Bugarc&#780;ic&#769;, Andrea</field><field name="description">Rotavirus is a non-enveloped dsRNA virus that belongs to the family Reoviridae and is associated with severe dehydrating diarrhea in infants and young children throughout the world. Rotavirus targets the fully differentiated epithelial cells lining the tips of the small intestinal villi. Although different aspects of the rotavirus replication cycle have been researched extensively, the mechanism underlying the assembly of mature viral particles and the precise method by which rotavirus is able to induce diarrheal disease have not been fully elucidated. The rotavirus replication cycle involves budding of immature progeny virus particles, termed DLPs, from the site of replication and assembly into the lumen of ER via an interaction of the particle with the cytoplasmic domain of a virally encoded non-structural protein, NSP4. Recent studies confirm subcellular localisation of this protein in distinct membrane lipid microdomains at the later stages of the viral replication cycle in polarised epithelial cells and further classify these structures as a final assembly location for mature viral particles. Overall aim of the study presented in Chapter 3 was to characterise the domain of NSP4 responsible for such interaction and to further elucidate the significance of proposed interaction in the context of the rotavirus replication cycle. In order to assess this interaction in vitro, separate domains of the NSP4 protein, expressed by several different recombinant protein expression systems, were applied to a Caco-2 cell lysate and examined by floatation gradient and subsequent Western blot analysis. The NSP4-lipid microdomain interaction was mapped to a part of a coiled-coil domain including amino acids 85 to 122. The potential involvement of NSP4 in translocation progeny DLPs to the site of final viral assembly was also examined. Recent studies suggest involvement of this protein in the pathophysiology of rotavirus-induced diarrhea by acting as an enterotoxin. To mediate enterotoxic effects in vivo, NSP4 needs to be secreted or released from rotavirus-infected cells in a soluble form, but studies indicate that this is a transmembrane glycoprotein located in the ER membrane. Overall aim of the studies outlined in Chapter 4 was to identify and further characterise secretion of NSP4 from rotavirus-infected fully polarised Caco-2 cells. These studies reveal that NSP4 is actively secreted into the culture medium of polarised, but not non-polarised cells. The secretion was detected preferentially from the apical surface and was found to be dramatically inhibited by addition of BFA and monensin, suggesting a Golgi-dependent pathway is involved in release of this protein. In accordance with this finding, the secreted NSP4 isoform was found to undergo additional post-translational modification and is partially resistant to deglycosylation by EndoH and PNGaseF. Furthermore, apical secretion was not blocked by addition of glucosidase- or cholesterol- inhibitors, and no evidence was found that NSP4 was packaged in exosomes for its release. Taken together, these studies outline the pool of NSP4 that is able to actively participate in an assembly of mature progeny virus particles through its interaction with lipid microdomains and further identify a novel, soluble form of NSP4 secreted from rotavirus-infected polarised cells.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1980</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Relationship Between Importance and Time Allocation: Conceptualisations and Conditions in Learning, Social and Spiritual Domains</field><field name="creator">Lai, Mei Kuin</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1064</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Enhanced wind tunnel techniques and aerodynamic force models for yacht sails</field><field name="creator">Hansen, Heikki</field><field name="description">Accurate prediction of performance is an important aspect of modern sailing yacht design and provides a competitive advantage on the racecourse and in the marketplace. Although wind tunnel testing of yacht sails is a common tool for obtaining input data for Velocity Prediction Programs, its results have not been validated against aerodynamic full-scale measurements as quality full-scale data is rare. Wind tunnel measurements are conducted at the Twisted Flow Wind Tunnel of The University of Auckland and are compared to the full-scale aerodynamic force measurements from the Berlin Sail-Force-Dynamometer. To realise this comparison wind tunnel techniques and aerodynamic force models for yacht sails are enhanced; this in turn also improves the accuracy of Velocity Prediction Programs.  Force and surface pressure measurements were conducted demonstrating that the interaction of the hull/deck with the sails has a significant effect on the side force and the force perpendicular to the deck plane, and that this should be considered in aerodynamic analysis of sails and the performance prediction of yachts.  The first Real-Time Velocity Prediction Program for wind tunnel testing has been developed and implemented as an additional module of FRIENDSHIP-Equilibrium. Model sails can now be trimmed based on the full-scale performance of the yacht, and at the correct heel angle, which makes the trimming process in the wind tunnel much more similar to the real life situation.  Improved aerodynamic force models have been developed from realistically depowered sail trims obtained with the Real-Time Velocity Prediction Program. An empirical model that describes the force and moment changes due to depowering in detail has been developed and implemented. The standard semi-empirical trim parameter model, which expresses depowering in a more generic way, has been enhanced based on aerodynamic principles and validated against the wind tunnel results.  Utilising the enhanced wind tunnel techniques and aerodynamic force models, a generally good qualitative and quantitative agreement with the full-scale data is achieved. Remaining challenges associated with full-scale and wind tunnel tests are however also highlighted and, based on this work alone, a conclusive judgement that scaling effects are negligible cannot be made.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Engineering</field><field name="subject">Sail aerodynamics</field><field name="subject">Wind tunnel testing</field><field name="subject">Full-scale sail force dynamometer</field><field name="subject">Trim parameters</field><field name="subject">Real-Time Velocity Prediction Program</field><field name="subject">Hull forces</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1759</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Quasi-Markets and Contracting for Health Services</field><field name="creator">Ashton, Toni</field><field name="description">ln 1993, the New Zealand health system was radically restructured. Area health boards, which were responsible for both purchasing and providing health services, were replaced by a quasi-market system in which public and private providers compete for public funds via contracts with purchasers. This thesis employs transaction cost economics (TCE) to examine the theory, the policy and the practice of the emerging quasi-market for health services in New Zealand. The main hypothesis which emerges from TCE is that contractual arrangements, which differ in their costs, will be aligned with transactions, which differ in their attributes, in a way which minimizes the sum of production and transaction costs. If services involve specific assets, or are difficult to measure and monitor, the transaction costs of contracting are likely to be high. The structure of the New Zealand health system prior to and after 1993 are described and analysed. Features of the emerging quasi-market include monopsonistic regional purchasers, a highly concentrated market for hospital services, weak budget constraints for CHEs, and a lack of competitive or political neutrality. All of these factors tend to dilute any incentives for efficiency. The TCE framework is used to examine the early contracting experiences and contractual relationships for four different health services: rest homes, primary health clinics, surgical services and mental health services. The selection of these four services was based upon a profiling of the characteristics which, according to TCE, are likely to influence the cost of transactions. The results support the central argument of the thesis. That is, that the costs of contracting are higher for some services than for others because of inherent differences in the attributes of different health services. A blunt policy instrument which forces a split between the roles of purchaser and provider for all health services fails to recognise these differences and may prohibit the development of organizational structures which might otherwise be selected as means of economizing on the transaction costs. Efforts must now be made to encourage a more discriminating approach to contracting in which a classical or neo-classical style of contracting is retained for those services where potential efficiency gains are high and the transaction costs of contracting are relatively low while longer-term relational contracts are developed for services where transaction costs are high.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1099</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The negotiation of meaning by advanced ESL learners: the effects of individual learner factors and task type</field><field name="creator">Bitchener, John</field><field name="description">During the last two decades, SLA researchers have given much attention to investigating the role that negotiated interaction plays in second language learning. Empirical research has demonstrated that the negotiation of meaning that occurs when communication difficulties arise may provide learners with opportunities to receive comprehensible input, provide feedback on form and meaning, and assist them in their production of modified output. While the short-term and long-term effects of negotiation on SLA are currently being examined, there is considerable evidence to suggest that the negotiation of meaning can facilitate the language learning process. From a pedagogical perspective, numerous studies have shown the effect that individual learner, task and context variables can have on promoting opportunities for negotiation. While some attention has been given to the effects of individual learner variables like ethnicity, gender and pairing, and to task and contextual variables on L2 negotiation, their effect on advanced learners has been little researched. This study examined the effect of three individual learner variables (ethnicity, gender and pairing) and certain communication tasks (free conversation and decision-making) on the way in which advanced ESL learners (Japanese and Korean males and females in monoethnic and interethnic dyads) repair communication problems and use the process of negotiation in their language learning. The study revealed that task was the only variable to affect the amount of negotiated repair: free conversation produced more negotiation than the decision making tasks. While monoethnic dyads provided more target language feedback than interethnic dyads, monoethnic and male dyads modified fewer trigger utterances than interethnic and female dyads. Korean subjects, particularly Korean males, modified more of their utterances when responding to feedback than the other subject groupings. Factors that may have accounted for the limited effect of the three individual learner variables include the insufficiently differentiated sociocultural and sociolinguistic background of the subjects and their perception of appropriate behaviour in L2 interactions. On the other hand, motivational and contextual factors appear to have resulted in the significant effect produced by the task variable.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1100</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The synthesis of 3,4-dihydroxyprolines and the incorporation of hydroxylated prolines into peptides and glycopeptides</field><field name="creator">Weir, Claudette Ann</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted at the request of the author</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1101</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reproductive Biology of Pohutukawa (Metrosideros Excelsa) (Myrtaceae)</field><field name="creator">Schmidt-Adam, Gabriele Hedwig Julia</field><field name="description">The objective of this project is to describe and analyse the reproductive biology of pohutukawa, by integrating information from floral biology, breeding system and pollination biology. New Zealand pohutukawa (Metrosideros excelsa Sol. ex Gaertn). a member of the Myrtaceae, is a mass-flowering tree endemic to northern New Zealand coastlines. Compound inflorescences develop over a period of ten weeks in six morphologically distinct stages. Trees flower over a peak period of two weeks, and the inflorescences contain an average of 14.3 large, hermaphrodite, red 'brush' flowers that remain open for seven days. Most pollen is viable (93.6%) and the receptivity of the wet-papillate stigma extends for at least nine days. Each flower produces approximately 46 &#956;L nectar per day, containing l8% (w/v) sucrose. Neither dichogamy nor herkogamy prevent pollen and stigma interference, and floral design and display are consistent with high levels of autogamous and geitonogamous self-pollination. The stigmatic exudate of unpollinated pistils stains intensely for carbohydrates, lipids and proteins, but shows a notable decrease in lipids and proteins following pollination. The style has a solid transmitting tissue with large mucilage-filled intercellular spaces which stain weakly for polyanions and pectins irrespective of pollination. Although starch grains in the stylar cortex are depleted following pollination, stylar resources in general appear to be sparse and this results in a low speed of pollen tubes (2 mm / d) through the intercellular spaces of the transmitting tissue. Seed capsules of pohutukawa contain a mixture of fertile (embryo-containing) and infertile (embryo-lacking) seeds. Fertile seeds weigh approximately 0.15 mg. stain positively with 1% tetrazolium chloride, and are randomly disposed on the placenta. Their germination rate exceeds 90% after up to one year of cold storage, but decreases rapidly when stored at room temperature. Controlled pollinations with self- and cross-pollen from single donors and a pollen mixture from five unrelated parents showed that seven out of ten trees were self-incompatible, suggesting that natural populations may consist of a mosaic of self-incompatible and self-compatible individuals. Self-incompatibility is late-acting as pollen tubes from selfs and crosses reach the ovary simultaneously l0 - 15 d after pollination. In common with other Myrtaceae, the seed / ovule ratio in pohutukawa is low and not limited by the stigmatic pollen load. The pollen / ovule ratio of 462.5 (SE &#177;43.4) places the breeding system of pohutukawa between facultative selfing and facultative outcrossing. Mainland populations of pohutukawa have been reduced to fragmented stands, and the original suite of bird pollinators has been largely replaced by introduced species. In contrast, the native pollinator fauna of several offshore islands remains intact, including the three species of the New Zealand honey eaters (Meliphagidae) and solitary bees. Using allozyme analyses. multilocus outcrossing rates were estimated for Little Barrier Island and Tiritiri Matangi Island and for three mainland populations in comparison. They were among the lowest in the Myrtaceae (tm = 0.22 - 0.53) and the loss of native pollinators has no measurable effect on the mating system. Although there is no difference in the germination percentage of fertile seeds from self- and cross-pollination treatments (98.4%), 'selfed' seedlings show marked inbreeding depression in height after six months. Wright's fixation index is consistently higher for seedlings (Fs) than for mothers (Fm) in all populations, indicating that selection may eliminate selfed offspring from populations prior to reproductive maturity. Exclusion experiments were undertaken on Little Barrier Island to assess the effect of native birds and bees on outcrossing and seed production. In bird exclusion experiments in the lower canopy (2 - 4 m) with flower access to bees only, estimated outcrossing rates were lower (tm = 0.40) than in open pollination (tm = 0.58), suggesting that bees effect more self-pollination than birds. The highest outcrossing rates (tm = 0.71) were found for open pollination in the upper canopy (&gt; 4 m). Numbers of fertile seeds per capsule were 45% higher after open pollination than in treatments with bee visitation only, and 28% higher than in treatments where all flower visitors were excluded. The results suggest that native bees visiting pohutukawa flowers reduce seed set and effect less outcrossing than birds, and that a large proportion of seeds arises from automatic self-pollination. In trees of a modified mainland population with predominantly introduced birds and a mixture of introduced and native bees there was no decrease in seed set for the treatment allowing flower access by bees only, indicating that - in contrast to native bees - honeybees did not reduce seed set in pohutukawa. In conclusion, although the floral biology of pohutukawa permits geitonogamy, a combination of outcrossing (predominantly by bird pollinators), self-incompatibility, and inbreeding depression act to maintain heterozygosity and result in the production of sufficient offspring that will ensure the survival of the species.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1102</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Spatial Assessment and Hazard Modeling of Tropical Forest Fires</field><field name="creator">Ofren, Rey S</field><field name="description">This research study offers a quantitative understanding of the environmental factors related to fire occurrence and its potential distribution. The Huai Kha Khaeng Wildlife Sanctuary, located in the northwestern region of Thailand, serves as an example to analyze and expand the knowledge base of forest fire ecology in tropical environments. Specific objectives focus on establishing the relationship between physiognomic variables that are related to forest fuel loading among different forest types. In addition, this study aims at modeling and quantifying the relative importance of the biophysical variables associated with the occurrence of tropical forest fires. The methodological framework links Geographic Information Systems (GIS) with the potential of statistical analysis. Thematic layers of several biophysical variables are combined in GIS, along with field measurements of fuel loading and stand physiognomy. Under the statistical analysis, the variability and interactions of spatial attributes related to fires are synthesized using the Decision Tree modeling. GIS is further employed to display the modeling results. Rainfall pattern, geological material, aspect and vegetation index variables significantly influence the ability of the Decision Tree model to predict the likely occurrence of fire. They explain most of the processes underlying a hierarchical set of rules that help to distinguish the varying levels of fire hazards. The vegetation index in particular was found to be a strong potential indicator of fire incidents and an underlying driving factor behind fuel moisture dynamics. At a certain vegetation index, two types of forest were distinguished as having wet and dry fuel conditions. The difference in the amount of fuel load between the physiognomically distinct evergreen and deciduous forests is proven to be insignificant, except in the variation of moisture content. Factors contributing to the varying levels of fuel moisture in evergreen forests are controlled by the micro-climate created by its intact crown cover. However, there is no distinct relationship concerning the stand structure of deciduous forest with regard to the dryness of fuel on its floor. The dominance of weather over the fuel variables suggests that forest fire situations in an open and dry stand of deciduous forest is driven by extreme weather conditions. A GlS-generated map of the sanctuary illustrates the spatial variation in fire hazard probabilities as predicted by the Decision Tree model. The prediction accuracy of fire hazard zones based on bio-physical factors is further enhanced by incorporating the proportion of neighbouring areas with high potential for ignition. The potential combustibility and danger rating are determined for the predicted hazard zones. In addition, the spatial association of the neighbouring human settlements is analyzed. This research expands the value of GIS from the usual selective retrieval and investigation of spatial patterns into the evaluation of the complex hierarchical combinations of spatial attributes. The combined effect of GIS and statistical modeling eliminates the problems of handling a mixture of environmental data and identifying both variables and attributes interactions. Likewise, the need to design site-specific fire managemet strategies, as guided by particular combinations of environmental attributes, takes into account the applicability of the data-driven Decision Tree modeling.

This harbour borders the highly urbanised and industrialised Auckland City metropolitan area. Whangaparaoa Peninsula, located approximately 30 km north of the other two collecting sites (away from the main urban area), was chosen as a reference site for comparative purposes. Physico-chemical analyses revealed differences in water quality at the sampling sites. A lower pH, oxygen deficiency and higher temperature were recorded in both the Waitemata Harbour locations in comparison with the reference site. Histopathological analyses revealed significantly higher prevalences and severity of pathological changes in the gills, blood, liver, kidney and gonads of the yellowbelly flounder from both harbour locations in comparison with fish from the reference site. ln addition, some types of lesions (eg. neoplasms) were observed in fish from the two harbour locations only. Abnormalities in the gill structure of fish from both harbour sites included: epithelial swelling (hyperplasia and hypertrophy), necrosis, and lifting with oedema; the fusion of secondary lamellae; aneurysms; filamental deformities; mucous cell proliferation, and infestation by Trichodina. The abnormalities found in the blood of these fish were manifested as: polycythaemia; erythrocytosis; erythroblastosis; leucocytosis (increased neutrophils); poikilocytosis; anisocytosis and an increased prevalence of erythrocytes undergoing necrosis. Vacuolar degeneration of the hepatocellular parenchyma due to lipid or glycogen accumulation was the most prominent liver change observed in fish from all sampling sites. The other liver abnormalities observed in flounder from the two harbour sites included: foci of cellular alterations (clear, basophilic and necrotic), congestion of the sinusoids, infestation by nematodes, and anaplastic growths (cholangiocellular carcinoma and teratoma). Pathological changes found in the kidneys of flounder collected at both harbour sites were classified as glomerular abnormalities (atrophy and dilatation of the glomerular tuft; enlargement of Bowman's space) and tubular vacuolar degeneration and necrosis. The presence of myxosporean parasites was also a common finding in the kidneys of harbour fish. Follicular atresia was the most prevalent change observed in the ovaries of flounder from the two harbour sites. Biochemical analysis of plasma proteins and electrolytes of flounder from the three sampling sites revealed hyperbilirubinaemia, hypoalbuminaemia and uraemia in those inhabiting both harbour sites. In addition, the concentration of total liver microsomal proteins was significantly depressed in flounder from harbour sites 1 and 2 when compared to that of fish from the reference site. Concentrations of heavy metals in the livers of flounder from different sampling localities were found to decrease in the order: site 2 &gt; reference site &gt; site 1, and did not correlate with the prevalences of liver abnormalities. Significantly more prominent pathological changes were thus observed in fish from both estuarine harbour sites in comparison with those from the reference open water site. The pathological changes noted are believed to occur in response to environmental changes. Contamination by different xenobiotics in the Whau and Henderson Creeks, which have been recorded in previous studies, suggest the possibility of direct toxic effects of the water contaminants on flounder from the estuarine parts of these creeks. In addition, the relatively high temperature, low pH and low oxygen levels recorded at the two sites in the Waitemata Harbour are believed to have induced oxygen deficiency-related tissue hypoxia which could then have led to the expression of a variety of diseases of which some have been detected in this study. However, the possibility that some unknown and unmeasured causal factors may have produced the observed pattern of flounder diseases cannot be eliminated.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270700 Ecology and Evolution::270702 Marine and estuarine ecology (incl. marine ichthyology)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1104</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Factors related to the pricing of audit services in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Neale, Ann Yvonne</field><field name="description">Listed companies in New Zealand appoint an auditor, first, in compliance with statute mandatory appointment) and, second, to monitor agent (management) performance compared to principal (shareholder)preferences. The monitoring requirements of the audit contract should be reflected in the audit fee. In this thesis, I use Simunic's (1980) fee model to investigate three questions regarding the determinants of audit pricing. First, auditors have the incentive to earn fee premiums (quasi-rents) by developing specialised monitoring skills that address the needs of industries with a differentiated demand for monitoring. Three classifications of differentiated monitoring are developed to investigate whether fee premiums are earned on those audits. Fee premiums are shown to be earned by Big Seven auditors over non-Big Seven auditors, but the null hypothesis that industry specialist auditors do not earn fee premiums over non-specialists is not rejected. The incentive to earn quasi-rents in future fees provides a rationale for auditors to bid a reduced audit fee in order to gain incumbency (DeAngelo, 1981a). The second research question uses a sample of audit fees from the first financial statements after listing to test for reduced fees on initial audits. Results indicate that audit fees for the first financial statements after listing are lower than the level of audit fee for existing companies. Negotiation of audit fees may be affected by professional regulation. The third research question investigates whether abandonment of a fee scale by the professional accounting body in New Zealand influenced the general level of audit fees. The results fail to reject the null hypothesis that there is no difference in fees before and after abandonment of the fee scale. The incentive to develop industry-specialised monitoring skills may be replaced, in a small country, by alternate audit practice development strategies; for example, diversification of an audit portfolio in order to spread risk. Auditor brand name, reflecting technical skills, may thus earn a fee premium in preference to industry specialist skills. A final limitation of this work arises from the time period of interest (1985-87), a time of change in New Zealand's business environment, in which audit fee determinants may be subject to effects not captured in this thesis.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1105</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The fractal modelling of turbulent surface-layer winds</field><field name="creator">Lauren, Michael Kyle</field><field name="description">Multiscaling analysis and cascade simulation techniques, which form part of the more general field of fractals, are introduced as a method for characterising and simulating surface-layer winds, particularly for time scales associated with the energy-containing range. This type of analysis consists of determining the power-law parameter of the spectrum of the data, and the scaling of the statistical moments. These techniques were applied to determine how the statistics depended on the duration (or scale) of the fluctuations in wind speed, the atmospheric conditions, and the topography of the site. It was found that the parameterisations produced using multiscaling analysis characterised differences in the statistics for each of these cases. Furthermore, the fractal cascade simulation techniques used provided simple methods for reproducing these statistics. This analysis is followed by an investigation into the robustness of some of these results. In particular, the data is examined for the existence of self-similar distributions of the cascade weighting factor, W. Such self-similar analysis allows the direct simulation of the data via a cascade. Cascade models have the virtue of being able to reproduce statistical properties such as intermittency, and in particular, the nesting of intermittency from different wavenumber bands in the same region of space. The existence of these properties in both the experimental and simulated data is investigated, with consideration given to the consequence of the results for simulation techniques. One notable discovery is the failure of these methods to reproduce the bias in the distribution of the gradients in the wind velocity field. This result has important implications for all workers dealing with simulation of geophysical data by fractal cascades. Finally, a brief numerical experiment is carried out to both demonstrate how this bias may be exploited to construct a model, and to test some of the analysis techniques presented on non-cascade based data. While not a particularly convincing simulator of turbulence, the model nevertheless displays some interesting turbulence-like characteristics.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1106</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Parenting after assisted conception by in vitro fertilisation, gift or donor insemination</field><field name="creator">Adair, Vivienne</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">1994</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1108</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Influence of children in family purchase decisions: the development and use of an observational scale as a method of measuring influence</field><field name="creator">Lee, Christina Kwai-Choi</field><field name="description">Although the influence of children in the family decision making process has been accepted as a force which neither academics nor practitioners can ignore, the degree and nature of this influence has not been satisfactorily established. This hiatus in the body of marketing knowledge provides the topic for this thesis. A conceptual model linking the variables that affect household purchase decisions was formulated by surveying the relevant literature. This model serves both as a pedagogical framework within which to discuss the literature, and as a guide to the formulation of a set of research hypotheses for the work reported here. Eighty-nine observations of family interactions during a simulated decision situation were recorded in the families' homes, using a video camera. The videotapes were later content-analyzed by three independent judges. Self-report data about perceived influence structures were collected at the same time. The development of the Observed Influence Scale (OIS) takes primacy here. The scale was tested for reliability and validity and the results using the scale were compared to those generated by the self-report scales. The OIS was then applied to provide data, over three stages of the decision process, to test the series of hypotheses about family decision-making mentioned above. Multivariate analysis of variance was performed for each family role player, using the three stages of the influence process as the dependent variables and Social class, Sex-role orientation (SRO), Wife's occupation, Involvement, Decision styles and Gender composition of the children as the independent variables. Several patterns of behaviour emerged. Significant effects were found for all the variables tested, although not all the research hypotheses were supported in the expected manner. The effects upon influence of Social class, SRO and Wife's occupation are interactive, the other three variables stand alone. It was found, inter alia, that mothers and elder sons, and fathers and elder daughters work together to gain influence in the family decision. The implications of the research for consumer behaviour theory and practice are discussed.</field><field name="date">1994</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1137</field></doc><doc><field name="title">New Zealand English language periodicals of literary interest active 1920s-1960s</field><field name="creator">Hamilton, Stephen Derek</field><field name="description">The primary objective of this thesis is to provide an account of New Zealand literary magazine activity from the 1920s to the 1960s. While a focus is maintained on the fifteen year period between the appearance of the first issue of Phoenix in March 1932 and the advent of Landfall, the thesis examines several magazines whose issue runs extend well outside that period. The thesis is divided into two volumes, the first of which, in Chapters Two through Five, provides a detailed survey of the four most important periodicals published entirely within the period selected for this study: Phoenix (1932-1933), Tomorrow (1934-1940), Book (1941-1947), and New Zealand New Writing (1942-1945). Chapter Six concludes Volume One with a survey of the numerous university based periodicals, including several published entirely outside the focal period of the study. In Volume Two, Chapters Seven to Nine discuss, in order, the Auckland family magazine the Mirror (1922-1963), the national magazine of the arts Art in New Zealand (1928-1946), and the travel journal the Near Zealand Railways Magazine (1926-1940). All three of these publications are of significance as early sites for the development in New Zealand of the popular fiction genres of romance, adventure and mystery. Chapter Ten deals with a range of minor little magazines, including the New Zealand Mercury (1933-1936), Quill (1934-1948), Anvil (1945-1946), Chapbook (1945-1950), Oriflamme: A Literary Journal (1939-1942), and those edited, printed and published by Noel Farr Hoggard: Spilt Ink (1932-1937), New Triad (1937-1942), Letters (1943-1946), and Arena'(1946-1972). Appendix I supplies an annotated bibliography of the fifty-two periodicals discussed in the body of the thesis. These annotations are supplemented with author indexes for those periodicals not already indexed by earlier researchers. Appendix II compares the text of Allen Curnow's 1939 prose and poetry sequence Not in Narrow Seas with an early version of the sequence published in Tomorrow between June 1937 and August 1938.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1146</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The archaeology of Maori occupation along the Waihou River, Hauraki</field><field name="creator">Phillips, Caroline</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">1994</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370300 Anthropology</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420300 Cultural Studies::420306 Maori cultural studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1159</field></doc><doc><field name="title">About our father's business: fatherhood in New Zealand 1900-1940</field><field name="creator">Frank, Timothy</field><field name="description">Early twentieth-century New Zealand fathers have commonly been regarded as distant figures in their children's lives, minimally involved in child care, and expressing their parenting in breadwinning terms. Although the numbers of men who married and had families steadily increased between 1900 and 1940, it is generally accepted that little changed in terms of men's parenting participation in the home. This thesis tests the veracity of these assumptions by comparing the private experiences of fathers with official and public records of fatherhood. It also examines the degree to which the culture of fatherhood and fathering practices 'modernised' during this period. Fathering between 1900 and 1940 was significantly impacted by the fact that mothers were regarded as the primary care givers in- New Zealand homes during that period. By 1900 social expectations of fathers were relatively well defined, although some important new directions in social thinking about fathers were also developing (Chapter one). However, the socially-constructed parameters defining fatherhood did not mean all fathers fathered alike. A wide variety of parenting attitudes and practices characterised fathering in private (Chapter Two). Yet fathering was always subject to public and official scrutiny, and Chapter Three examines politicians' efforts to encourage and improve fathering responsibility prior to the First World War. Ironically, these efforts succeeded-in diminishing some of the domestic patriarchal authority fathers exercised over their children (Chapter Four). This patriarchal/paternal authority was challenged at the same time the state and the Plunket Society helped entrench an increasingly mother-prioritised culture of child care in New Zealand society (Chapter Five). In the interwar years, fathers faced significant threats to their idea of themselves as breadwinners, some of them falling foul of the state and its determination to tackle the 'errant parent' as a result (Chapter Six). But fathers and fatherhood did not stand still, and by the 1930s some essential differences separated them from their 1900s predecessors. The culture of fatherhood was impacted more than fathering practice by 'modernising' attitudes to child care and the new relational paradigms influencing parent-child interaction at this time. But attitudes influence conduct, and although a mother-prioritised parenting culture remained intact into the 1940s, fathers were learning to understand their parenting place in the home and their interaction with children in significantly new ways (Chapters Seven and Eight).</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::430000 History and Archaeology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1222</field></doc><doc><field name="title">O le A'oa'oina o le gagana, faitautusi ma le tusitusi i le a'oga a le faifeau: Ekalesia Faapotopotoga Kerisiano Samoa (EFKS) = Literacy education, language, reading and writing in the pastor's school: Congregational Christian Church of Samoa (CCCS)</field><field name="creator">Tanielu, Lonise Sera</field><field name="description">This study is about an educational experience, which encompasses a range of educational knowledge and skills. It is an experience that is relatively unknown in educational research terms. It is also ct comparatively 'secular' educational experience within a 'religious' institution, the Congregational Christian Church of Samoa (CCCS). The Pastor's School (A'oga a le Faifeau) system teaches children to read and write, employing both Palagi and Fa'a Samoa frameworks. The study is also a positive response to the critical and sometimes negative historical treatment of the church and the Fa'a Samoa, especially in their role in the Samoan child's critical literacy experiences. In the light of the underachievement of Samoan children (especially in literacy-reading and writing), this thesis makes two arguments. They are: i) The Pastors' Schools are an important educational system that have escaped attention but which have profoundly significant educational content and impacts. ii) There is a literacy problem in New Zealand that the A'oga a le Faifeau could address for the reported underachieving Samoan children. The content of the A'oga a le Faifeau syllabus for example, includes the teaching of reading, writing, arithmetic, religious and general knowledge, and the Fa'a Samoa This knowledge forms part of the semantic resources, and literacy skills and expertise, which could prepare children for school because some of those knowledge and skills have spans to school-based literacies. One of the A'oga a le Faifeau's most significant educational impacts is the maintenance and retention of the Samoan language.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1209</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Aroha&#8217;s granddaughters: representations of Maaori women in Maaori drama and theatre 1980-2000</field><field name="creator">Hansen, Mei-Lin Te-Puea</field><field name="description">This thesis explores representations of Maaori women characters in plays written by Maaori between 1980 and 2000, arguing that, as the level of self-determination in Maaori theatre has increased, these representations have become less stereotyped and more reflective of a range of Maaori women&#8217;s realities. The thesis suggests that waahine dramatists in particular represent contemporary Maaori cultural identity as flexible, diverse and changing. The Introduction gives reasons for the thesis' focus on Maaori women and outlines three major influences which have determined the approach to close-readings and analyses of waahine characters in the body of the thesis: an early Paakehaa representation of Maaori women, an increase of Maaori dramatists and the emergence of Maaori women's feminism. The thesis comprises a further six chapters. Chapter One contextualises the play analyses which appear in Chapters Four Five and Six by describing a Maaori theatre and drama whakapapa that stakes a significant and influential place for waahine theatre practitioners. Chapters Two and Three explore tino rangatiratanga/sel-determination and marae-concept theatre (respectively), arguing that between 1980 and 2000 these aspects of content and form have created theatrical conditions which facilitate Maaori women's representation. Chapters Four, Five and Six show that, as Maaori women such as Renee' Rena Owen, Riwia Brown, Roma Potiki and Briar Grace-Smith have become more active in the Maaori theatre whakapapa, contemporary representations of Maaori women have become more complex and diverse. A set of bibliographic appendices provides detailed lists of first productions of plays mentioned in the thesis. Throughout, the thesis maps the increased visibility and presence of Maaori women on the New Zealand stage, showing how in the years 1980-2000 the theatre has become a potent site for expression and exploration of Maaori cultural identity.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420300 Cultural Studies::420306 Maori cultural studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1420</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Automatic structures</field><field name="creator">Rubin, Sasha</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates structures that are presentable by finite automata working synchronously on tuples of finite words.

As a result, software protection has become a vital issue in current computer industry and a hot research topic. Software watermarking and obfuscation are techniques to protect software from unauthorized access, modification, and tampering. While software watermarking tries to insert a secret message called software watermark into the software program as evidence of ownership, software obfuscation translates software into a semantically- equivalent one that is hard for attackers to analyze. In this thesis, firstly, we present a survey of software watermarking and obfuscation. Then we formalize two impor- tant concepts in software watermarking: extraction and recognition and we use a concrete software watermarking algorithm to illustrate issues in these two concepts. We develop a technique called the homomorphic functions through residue numbers to obfuscate variables and data structures in software programs. Lastly, we explore the complexity issues in software watermarking and obfuscation.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">computer science</field><field name="subject">software security</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1511</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Augmented reality visualisation for mobile robot developers</field><field name="creator">Collett, Toby H. J.</field><field name="description">Developer interactions with robots during the testing and debugging phases of robot development are more complex than and distinct from general software application development. One of the primary differences is the need to understand the robot's view of the environment and the inconsistencies between this and the actual environment. Augmented reality (AR) provides an ideal way to achieve this, allowing robot program data to be displayed in context with the real world. This allows for easy comparison by the developer, highlighting the cause for any bugs in the robot behaviour. An AR debugging space is created in this work that allows the developer to have this enhanced understanding of the robot's world-view, thus improving developer efficiency.  Over the past decade robots have begun to move out of industrial assembly lines and into environments that must be shared with human users. Many of the tasks that we wish robots to perform in these environments require close interaction and collaboration with human users. The move away from the constrained environment of a production line means that the tasks required of robots are more varied, their operating environment is far more complex and unpredictable, and safety can no longer be achieved through isolation of the robot. The result of these influences has been to change robot programming from a simple task of instructing the robot to perform a sequence of steps to an open ended challenge of specifying dynamic interactions that robot developers are still coming to terms with. Robot development is more than just design and code entry and a broader approach to improving robot development is needed. One of the founding principles of this thesis is that robot development should be approached as a human-robot interaction issue, this particularly applies to the testing and debugging phases of the development.  The nature of the robot platform, the tasks the robot is required to perform and the environments that robots work within are significantly different from those of the desktop application. Hence robot developers need a tailored tool chain that focuses on this unique combination of issues. Current robot programming research is dominated by robot APIs and frameworks, leaving support tools to be developed in an ad hoc manner by developers as features are required. This leads to disjointed tools that have minimal feature sets; tools that generally have poor portability when applied to other robot developments. This work examines the needs of the developer in terms of a general purpose robot visualisation tool.  One of the fundamental requirements of a general purpose robot visualisation tool is that a set of stock visualisations must be available for the developer. A prerequisite to providing these is to have a set of standard interfaces to provide the visualisations for. The open source robot framework Player/Stage was used throughout this work to provide standardised access to robot hardware. As part of this research the author has contributed heavily to the Player/Stage project, particularly as one of the key developers of the 2.0 release of Player. This new release simplifies Player development and increases the ease of maintenance of Player drivers and the efficiency of the server core.  To evaluate the benefits of AR visualisation an intelligent debugging space was developed, which runs as a permanent installation in a robotic development lab providing an enhanced view of the robot's behaviour to the developer. The space is capable of automatically detecting the presence of robots and displaying visualisations of the standard interfaces of the robot, such as its sensors and effectors. The debugging space also allows the developer to create custom renderings, leveraging the developer's ability to determine the most salient items of their code and display these.  A set of representative case studies was carried out using the debugging space for testing and debugging. These studies showed that AR provides an opportunity to understand the type of errors that are encountered during debugging. Debugging is essentially a process of elimination and by understanding the type of error developers can quickly eliminate large sets of potential bug sources, focusing on the sections of code that are causing the bug and therefore substantially reducing debugging time. The implemented system also shows that AR provides an important stepping stone between simulation environments and the real world.  This thesis contributes the novel approach of applying AR to developer interactions with robots. The use of AR has been shown to have significant benefits for the robot developer, enhancing their understanding of the robot's world-view and hence reducing debugging time. As part of the work a flexible AR visualisation tool was developed with close integration to the Player/Stage project. This tool creates an intelligent debugging space where developers can exploit the benefits of the AR visualisation with minimal overhead.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Robotics</field><field name="subject">Augmented Reality</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1510</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A toolkit for the visualization of tensor fields in biomedical finite element models</field><field name="creator">W&#252;nsche, Burkhard Claus</field><field name="description">Medical imaging is an essential tool for improving the diagnoses, understanding and treatment of a large variety of diseases. Over the last century technology has advanced from the discovery of x-rays to a variety of 3D imaging tools such as magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography, positron emission tomography and ultrasonography. As a consequence the size and complexity of medical data sets has increased tremendously making it ever more difficult to understand, analyze, compare and communicate this data. Visualization is an attempt to simplify these tasks according to the motto "An image says more than a thousand words". This thesis introduces a toolkit for visualizing biomedical data sets with a particular emphasis on second-order tensors, which are mathematically described by matrices and can be used to express complex tissue properties such as material de-formation and water diffusion. The toolkit has a modular design which facilitates the comparison and exploration of multiple data sets. A novel field data structure allows the interactive creation of new measures and boolean filters are introduced as a universal visualization tool. Various new visualization methods are presented including new colour mapping techniques, ellipsoid-based textures and a line integral convolution texture for visualizing tensor fields. To motivate the design and to assist in the use of the toolkit, guidelines for creating effective visualizations are derived by using perceptual concepts from cognitive science. A new classification for visual attributes according to representational accuracy, perceptual dimension and spatial requirements is presented and the results are used to derive values for the information content and information density of each attribute. A review and a classification of visualization icons completes the theoretical background. The thesis concludes with two case studies. In the first case study the toolkit is used to visualize the strain tensor field in a healthy and a diseased human left ventricle. New insight into the cardiac mechanics is obtained by applying and modifying techniques traditionally used in solid mechanics and computational fluid dynamics. The second case study explores ways to obtain in vivo information of the brain anatomy by visualizing and systematically exploring Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) data. Three new techniques for the visualization of DTI data are presented: Barycentric colour maps allow an integrated view of different types of diffusion anisotropy. Ellipsoid-based textures and Anisotropy Modulated Line Integral Convolution create images segmented by tissue type and incorporating a texture representing the 3D orientation of nerve fibers. The effectiveness of the exploration approach and the new visualization techniques are demonstrated by identifying various anatomical structures and features from a diffusion tensor data set of a healthy brain.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::291500 Biomedical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1225</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Molecular genetics of idiopathic hyperphosphatasia</field><field name="creator">Chong, Belinda Yuen Yee</field><field name="description">The subject of this thesis is the molecular genetic study of idiopathic hyperphosphatasia. The work in this thesis describes linkage analysis, mutation screening of candidate genes and the functional analysis of mutant proteins expressed in patients with a clinical diagnosis of idiopathic hyperphosphatasia. Idiopathic hyperphosphatasia is an autosomal recessive bone disease characterized by excessive bone resorption and bone formation. Affected children are normal at birth but develop deformities of long bones, kyphosis and acetabular protrusion with increasing severity as they pass through adolescence. There is considerable variability in phenotype, with some cases diagnosed in infancy and others in later childhood. A genome-wide search of a New Zealand family affected by idiopathic hyperphosphatasia suggested linkage to a locus on the long arm of chromosome 8 (8q24). The gene TNFRSF11B encoding osteoprotegerin (OPG), which lies within 8q24, was an obvious candidate gene given the critical role of OPG in regulating osteoclast development. Mutation screening of this gene indicated an apparent disease-causing mutation in exon 3 in affected individuals of the New Zealand family. Subsequently eight families, recruited by the members of the Idiopathic Hyperphosphatasia Collaborative Group in Turkey, Germany, Argentina and the United kingdom were also screened for mutations in the TNFRSF11B gene. Recombinant wild-type and mutant OPG CDNAs were expressed in human epithelial kidney cells, and secreted OPG was collected form the conditioned medium. In vitro measurements of osteoclastic bone resorption showed that wild type OPG suppressed bone resorption, whereas the mutant forms did not, confirming them to be inactivating mutations.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270200 Genetics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1223</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of Christology from a tribal perspective: with special reference to Mizoram, northeast India</field><field name="creator">Lalpekhlua, L. H.</field><field name="description">This thesis seeks to interpret Christology from the perspective of tribal people in Mizoram, northeast India, with an objective to help them and their churches to understand Jesus Christ in a way meaningful to them. In this study, historical and socio-theological analysis is used to show that Christology and culture are always related, and that different Christologies have been developed in different cultural contexts. This analysis in turn helps identify the issues that must be addressed in the construction of a contextual Christology for Mizoram context. In this study, Mizo culture and experience are taken into account as essential theological source. The first chapter discusses the need for a contextual Christology and examines the basic issues and methodological approaches surrounding the construction of contextual Christology. In the second chapter, the context of tribal people in Mizoram is analysed. Among the major issues that must be addressed in Christological construction, the thesis identifies the growing disparity between rich and poor within the state and the socio-economic alienation of Mizos from mainland India. The third chapter surveys the Christological tradition in Mizoram from its beginning to the present. It finds that the Christological heritage in Mizoram is largely irrelevant to Mizo people because of its uncritical application of Western theology to this very different historical and cultural context. The idea of Christ introduced into Mizoram is basically individualistic, otherworldly and dualistic. Neither missionaries nor native church leaders have taken the local culture seriously into account in doing Christology. The fourth chapter attempts to recover some major liberating cultural traditions of the Mizos as sources for Christology, including their concepts of pasaltha, humanity, land, God and spiritual beings, and life after death. The study reveals that, despite the Western overlay, there is a significant continuity and influence of traditional culture in Mizo Christianity. On the basis of these findings, the fifth chapter seeks to reinterpret the significance of Jesus Christ in the Mizoram context, using a Mizo conceptual framework. It argues that the idea of the pasaltha incorporates much of the New Testament portrait of the person and work of Christ, Jesus' self-giving life and ministry, incarnation, suffering and death on the cross, can all be seen as manifesting the principle of tlawmngaihna, which is an essential characteristic of the pasaltha. Jesus' resurrection and exaltation can be seen as God's response to Jesus' person and work precisely as pasaltha-tlawmngai. Similarly, the kingdom of God, which defined and summed up Jesus' message and mission, can be perceived in the Mizoram context as exhibiting the qualities of a communitarian society.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::440000 Philosophy and Religion	::40200 Religion and Religious Traditions::440204 Christian theology (incl.

The first chapter following the introduction is concerned with modeling partial consumer participation in the context of two-way interconnection in telecommunications. Partial consumer participation is introduced into the model of competition between telecommunications networks developed by Armstrong (1998), Carter and Wright (1999) and Laffont et al (1998a). It is shown that the result that firms are indifferent over the access charge under two-part tariffs no longer holds when there is partial consumer participation. Under some additional simplifying assumptions, it is shown that firms prefer that the access charge is set equal to the marginal cost of termination. Without these additional assumptions the model is analytically complex and numerical simulation results are presented which shown that firms prefer the access charge to be less than marginal cost, while the socially optimal access charge is above cost. The next chapter considers competition between two-sided networks. Firms with two-sided networks facilitate connections or transactions between two distinct populations of consumers. This chapter analyses the behaviour of such firms where there are no intrinsic benefits to consumers other than the network effects, examples of which include employment agencies, real estate agents and videogame platforms. The modelling framework encompasses both matching service and platform business models and allows for subscription or per-transaction pricing. Three different market structures are considered: monopoly, and duopoly with and without compatibility. Comparisons of prices, profits, consumer surplus, and welfare are made between the three regimes. It is shown that one side of the market generally pays a lower price than the other, and the conditions under which one side of the market is charged a zero price are derived. It is also shown that duopoly with compatibility is socially preferable to the other regimes, while monopoly is socially preferable to duopoly without compatibility. The final chapter examines the reputation systems that are increasingly accompanying network businesses. This chapter explores the trade-off between the short-term benefits of false quality advertisements by sellers in a market with asymmetric information against the longer term costs of reputation damage. A directed search model is constructed in which submarkets are created by the advertisements and reputations of sellers. A reputation system links misleading advertisements in the present period to a lower reputation in the next period. It is shown that a reputation system always increases the prices of high quality products and directs search more accurately towards the sellers with such products. It is also shown that buyers are hurt by a reputation system if the market is thin - has few sellers &#8211; because the equilibrium increase in prices is greater than the equilibrium increase in the quality of trade. On the other hand, it is shown that submarket creation by a reputation system always increases total welfare because buyers' search is directed more accurately and the number of quality adjusted matches increases. Finally, it is shown that a reputation system which screens for honesty increases social welfare by making sellers more truthful, however, a reputation for honesty is not always highly valued and an alternative reputation system which screens for type can be more effective.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::340000 Economics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1284</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterisation and detection of viruses (Cucumovirus, Potyvirus) infecting vanilla in R&#233;union Island and Polynesian Islands</field><field name="creator">Le Roux, Karin, 1974-</field><field name="description">Natural vanilla (Vanilla planifolia, V. tahitensis) is economically important for a number of producing countries, but viral diseases are prejudicial to its successful cultivation. Techniques are required to detect viruses in vanilla plants in order to establish quarantine procedures and sources of virus-free planting material. This study contributed to the progress in managing viral diseases of vanilla by firstly identifying Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV, cucumovirus) as causing severe distortion, stunting, sterility and sometimes death of vanilla plants. Vanilla CMV isolates from French Polynesia (Pacific Ocean) and R&#233;union Island (Indian Ocean) were classified in CMV subgroup IB, adding to the short list of subgroup IB isolates detected outside of Asia. Two isolates were putatively classified in subgroup IA, suggesting that CMV in vanilla is still evolving and/or that vanilla is infected from different sources. Subgroup II CMV from New Zealand was also experimentally infectious to V. planifolia, showing that vanilla crops should be protected from all potential sources of CMV inoculum. Existing serological and molecular detection rests were performant for the detection of CMV directly from vanilla tissue. Secondly, this study provided the first coat protein sequence information for Vanilla mosaic virus (VanMV, Potyvirus). A Cook Islands isolate (VanMV-CI) and a French Polynesia isolate (VanMV-FP) had distinctly different coat proteins. The VanMV-FP CP N-terminus contained a stretch of amino-acid repeats (GTN) typical of natively unfolded proteins. This GTN stretch was located downstream of a DVG motif (which replaced the more common aphid transmission DAG motif), suggesting a role in improving aphid transmission, or regulating formation of the HC-virus complex. CP core nucleotide sequence identities indicated VanMV-CI and VanMV-FP were strains of Dasheen mosaic virus (DsMV). In contrast, CP amino-acid sequence homologies between VanMV- CI and DsMV were intermediate between strains and species, and CP amino-acid homologies between VanMV-FP and DsMV were typical of distinct species. In addition, VanMv-CI and VanMv-FP had characteristic 3'NTR sequences and NIb/CP cleavage sites, and only infected vanilla. Hence, it is proposed that VanMV-CI and VanMV-FP are considered new Potyvirus species and named Vanilla mosaic Cook Islands virus and Vanilla mosaic French Polynesia virus. Alternatively, the two isolates may be grouped under the name Dasheen mosaic virus-Vanilla (DsMV-V) and distinguished from Dasheen mosaic virus-Dasheen(DsMV-D). Primers to VanMV-CI and VanMV-FP were designed and permitted RT-PCR detection of the viruses directly from vanilla tissue. VanMV-Cl and VanMV-FP could be differentiated from DsMV and Watermelon mosaic virus (WMV-Tonga), and differentiated from each other by comparison of amplicon size. Long-term specific potyvirus diagnosis is however expected to be difficult due to potyviral variability in vanilla. Future research should concentrate on techniques such as microarrays to permit simultaneous detection combined with specific identification of potyvirus species. Such techniques would be beneficial to viral disease management in vanilla and many other crops.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1289</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigations on the cell walls of commelinid monocotyledons</field><field name="creator">Trethewey, Jason Allan Karl</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1240</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A claim to truth: documentary, politics, production</field><field name="creator">Goldson, Annie</field><field name="description">The following thesis examines how documentary texts, in particular those that are associated with the tradition of political documentary, negotiate their way into being. For this purpose, I use a series of documentary case studies, each one structured around a work of my own. The five documentaries I examine were made through the decade 1990-2000 and, although these works address a range of specific cultural and political issues, they were produced either out of the US or New Zealand, the two countries within which I have lived while a documentary maker. My methodological approach is two-fold. First, I place each documentary within a framework designed by Bill Nichols as a way of defining documentary. Nichols, a major presence in the field of documentary studies, looks at documentary as constructed through a matrix of factors: the interplay of possible documentary modes and styles, pressures brought to bear through the institutional context surrounding documentary production, such as funding and distribution, the expectations of the genres' audiences, and the dialogue and influences generated by a community of documentary practitioners and their films and videos. In following Nichols' model, I offer up a modal and textual analysis for each of my own works cited, and examine, through a mixture of anecdote and theory, how funders, distributors, audiences and my fellow makers shaped my documentaries. In carrying out this examination, I also highlight certain debates that raged through the decade, particularly around documentary realism and identity politics, that were to have considerable impact on my work. My second methodological approach is to situate each work within a history of "political documentary". In Chapter One of this thesis I have attempted to categorize the various formulations of the sub-genre, which have developed since the inception of film over a century ago. In the ensuing chapters I examine how each of my documentaries draws on that history. My own body of works of course was produced in a relatively short period, but even within this time the historical changes the world has undergone are immense. Documentary is ever sensitive to its context and I chart the impact of political change on the texts being scrutinized. Although the focus, my own work, may appear narrow, the thesis draws on the tradition of participant observation and seeks, by analyzing the complexities of production within a series of case Studies, to cast light on contemporary documentary practice generally.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::410000 The Arts::410300 Cinema, Electronic Arts and Media Studies::410301 Film and video studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1246</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dynamics of benthic invertebrate communities in a northern New Zealand kauri forest stream ecosystem</field><field name="creator">Towns, D.

In a series of experiments I investigated the question of hemispheric asymmetries in the AB. Experiment 1 was a simplification of the experiment by Raymond et al. (1992) to determine whether the particular stimuli and task conditions of my study would produce an AB. In Experiments 2 and 3, two RSVP streams were presented in parallel, one in each visual field. The AB occurred only when participants both identified and located the target, and not when they simply located it. When targets and probes were both presented in the right visual field (RVF), the typical AB pattern was obtained, sparing probes in the first post-target location ("lag 1 sparing"). However, the AB was greatly attenuated when both target and probe were in the left visual field (LVF). When target and probe were in different spatial locations, there was a strong decrement in detecting the probe in the first post-target position-again more marked in the RVF. Cross-stream decrements may reflect the transient effects of shifting attention, while the AB itself appeared to be largely restricted to within-stream sequences, and to processing by the left cerebral hemisphere. Experiment 4 was a further behavioural study, in which I examined differences in functional cerebral asymmetries modulated by gonadal steroid hormones during the menstrual cycle in women. Twenty-one right handed women, with regular menstrual cycle, were tested with a double RSVP task (one stream in each visual field) during the low steroid menses and the high steroid midluteal phase. An AB was obtained bilaterally in the midluteal phase, while during menses the probe detection deficit was evident only in the RVF. Low steroid levels appeared to stabilize functional cerebral asymmetries. In contrast, high levels of estradiol and progesterone in the midluteal phase appeared to reduce functional asymmetries due to a selective enhancement of the AB in the right hemisphere. In Experiment 5 and 6 I recorded event-related potentials (ERPs) to examine the temporal course of the AB. probe-related ERPs were compared between the control condition and the experimental condition when the probe was presented in the blink period (post-target position 2-4) and in the no-blink period (post-target position 6-8). In the control condition in which the subjects were told to ignore the target, there was a negative peak around 300 ms following the probe, regardless of whether the probe was presented during the blink phase or during the no-blink phase. The same peak was found for the experimental condition when the probe was presented during the no-blink phase, but was missed for probes presented during the blink phase. This finding provides strong evidence that the AB reflects an impairment in a postperceptual stage of probe processing, probably at the stage of working memory. I replicated the finding (Vogel, Luck, &amp; Shapiro, 1998) that the AB and the P3 elicited by the target component are related. Source localisation of electrophysiological activities using low-resolution electromagnetic tomography (LORETA; Pascual-Marqui, Michel, &amp; Lehmann, 1994) revealed reduced activation during the AB in the left cerebral hemisphere when letters were used as stimuli, whereas the right hemisphere showed reduced activation when symbols were used.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1266</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Refocussing: the development and definition of the theory and its therapeutic practice with critical analysis and illustrative case studies</field><field name="creator">Divett, Diane Rosina</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1277</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The deployment and performance of indoor/outdoor DS-CDMA systems with multiuser detection</field><field name="creator">Pais, Adrian Victor</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates the deployment and performance of indoor/outdoor DS-CDMA systems assuming both conventional receivers and multiuser detection receivers at the base stations. In the first part of this thesis, measured propagation data and a DS-CDMA system performance testbed (based on a Monte Carlo analysis) are used to quantify both the downlink and uplink outage probabilities for a variety of deployment scenarios: (a) indoor-only systems; (b) interfering indoor/outdoor systems; and (c) interfering indoor systems located adjacent to each other. The results reveal that optimal indoor deployment strategies are heavily dependent on both the location and strength of interference emanating from outdoors. Indoor base station deployment strategies that are optimal in the absence of outdoor interference are often suboptimal if outdoor interference is present.  In the second part of this thesis, two simple multiuser detection techniques are chosen for implementation in the DS-CDMA system performance testbed: successive interference cancellation (SIC) and parallel interference cancellation (PIC). The performance estimation results show that orders-of-magnitude improvements in uplink outage probability are possible with both SIC and PIC. The extent of these improvements is dependent on the deployment strategy used, the fractional residual interference cancellation error, and the uplink power control algorithm (for the case of SIC). If perfect interference cancellation is assumed, it is evident from the results of this thesis that the cancellation of signals in parallel (PIC) provides no additional benefit to system performance than ranking and cancelling the signals sequentially (SIC).</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1491</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Indoor wireless communication system performance enhancement via environmental modification</field><field name="creator">Lee, Derek C. K.</field><field name="description">High capacity wireless communication systems require efficient reuse of the available frequency spectrum. Frequency reuse in buildings can be enhanced by modifying the environment. However, the potential benefits of environmental modification need to be evaluated systematically to justify the related costs. This thesis reports the methods, the deployment strategies and the resulting system performance improvement of in-building environmental modification. In the investigation, coordinated deployment of a wireless communication system with multiple base stations is considered in several single-floor office environments. The base stations, each servicing a cell, are assumed to operate at the same set of frequencies thus adjacent interference results. Two modification methods, namely, metal reflectors and metal shields, are considered to enhance desired signals and mitigate adjacent interference, respectively. Significant impact of both methods on the propagation channel is experimentally observed. The potential benefits of deploying structural shielding to control interference are considered. The levels of adjacent interference are estimated for different shielding strategies by an experimentally-validated ray-model, and the outage probabilities are computed with an interference-limited DS-CDMA system model. Deployment of structural shielding is shown to be most effective in drywall-partitioned environments and when the operating frequency is in the vicinity of 5 GHz. The average outage probability is shown to be reduced by approximately 94% and 90% at 1.8 GHz and 5.24 GHz, respectively, for a drywall-partitioned office environment after shielding 14% of the internal wall length. In open plan offices, the effectiveness of structural shielding is observed to diminish as the partition height reduces. Alternatively, considerable interference control is shown to be achieved by highly-reflective reflectors installed on the ceiling above the base stations. In the presence of a significant centrally-located environmental obstacle, the cost effectiveness of structural shielding deployment is shown to increase as the obstacle acts as an effective interference attenuator. If frequency selective surfaces (FSSs) are used instead of metal shields, a good shielding performance is shown to be achievable as long as the FSS stopband attenuation is maintained at above 20 dB for incident angles smaller than 50 degrees.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1487</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Factors that influence General Practitioner diagnostic decision-making and a comparison with other stakeholders</field><field name="creator">Callaghan, Kathleen Suzanne No&#235;lle</field><field name="description">Abstract  Background  An analysis of Accident Compensation Corporation claims shows &#8220;inconsistent and inadequate diagnoses&#8221; by health care providers.   Diagnostic performance is a result of two independent parameters, namely discrimination (accuracy) and decision (bias).  Bias is related to the medical practitioner&#8217;s perception of the costs and benefits of making one choice over another.  Bias may be statistical, sociological, political, biological or psychological in nature.   This study investigated the factors that potentially bias diagnostic decision-making by general practitioners and the subjective value placed on these factors by different stakeholder groups in society. Methods  Phase 1 of the study used focus groups of standard setters for general practitioners to identify factors that influenced diagnostic decision-making in general practice.  These factors were evaluated for importance and desirability using standard Delphi methodology and Rasch analysis.  Phase 2 of the study evaluated the importance and desirability of the factors identified in Phase 1 for influencing decision making as judged by significant health care stakeholder groups in New Zealand.   Participant response was via questionnaire analysed by the Rasch Model. Results  Thirty-nine factors were identified that potentially biased diagnostic decision-making in general practice.  The measurements of, particularly, desirability have high reproducibility across stakeholder groups and high positive loading for the first principal component consistent with construct validity.  No stakeholder group identifies factors consistent with Bayes&#8217; theorem of diagnostic reasoning as being the only desirable influence on diagnosis. There is considerable categorical homogeneity between the stakeholder groups GP, GPACC, P, RACCSLT and RACCSST.  Conclusions  The findings of this and other studies challenge the current biomedical paradigm, indicating a less than Bayesian approach to medical decision-making.  A social constructivist model, incorporating non-Bayesian factors into the definition of &#8220;illness&#8221; versus &#8220;disease&#8221;, may be more representative of reality.  A social constructivist model of medicine is incompatible with the current legislatory and administrative framework within which the Accident Compensation Corporation and a number of other medical organisations operate.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Human Factors</field><field name="subject">Diagnostic decision-making</field><field name="subject">Error management</field><field name="subject">Values</field><field name="subject">Accident compensation</field><field name="subject">Medicine</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::320100 Medicine-General</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1907</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Splat-substrate interactions in high velocity thermal spray coatings</field><field name="creator">Trompetter, W. J.</field><field name="description">Thermal spray coatings applied with high velocity techniques produce dense, industrial quality coatings with strong adhesion and minimal decomposition. This thesis reports on investigations of splat-substrate interactions for both solid and molten splats. Specifically, individual particles were studied to see how the particle is altered during the spray coating process, how they bond to the substrate and the role of surface oxides. Investigations of NiCr particles high velocity air fuel (HVAF) thermally sprayed onto different materials found that soft substrates predominantly had deeply penetrating solid particles, whereas harder substrates resisted particle penetration and had a higher percentage of molten splats. This effect is caused by particle kinetic energy converted into heat during plastic deformation. The percentage of particle kinetic energy converted into heat is proportional to substrate hardness. It was also discovered that during the coating process the oxide is not removed or altered in composition, but becomes redistributed over a larger surface area due to the plastic deformation of the substrate. During this process, small scale redistribution and penetration of the oxide material by the incoming particle occurs. These results support the idea that successful bonding can occur only when the surface oxide on the substrate and on the coating material has been disturbed (for solid splats) or disrupted (for molten splats).  To date, our knowledge of solid splat bonding processes within thermal spray coatings has been very subjective where mechanical and chemical bonding has been expected to contribute. In this thesis, the splat-substrate interface was investigated with focused ion beam (FIB) microscopy, cross-sectional SEM and cross-sectional TEM. For solid NiCr splat HVAF coatings, the discovery of interfacial formations, together with no evidence of chemical bonding across the particle-substrate interface suggest that mechanical bonding is the dominant bonding mechanism for solid splat coatings; where as chemical bonding only plays a role when splats and/or substrate become molten.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Thermal Spray coating</field><field name="subject">Interface</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::291300 Metallurgy::291301 Process metallurgy</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::291400 Materials Engineering::291402 Composite materials</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1758</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Comparative limnology of six hydroelectric dams on the Waikato River, New Zealand (1970-72)</field><field name="creator">Magadza, Christopher H.

It falls about 366 m during its course, the greater part of which occurs in the first 200 km after it leaves the lake. Ridall (1967) has treated the Waikato river as originating between Ruapehu mountain and the Kaimanawa ranges, but considering, the multitude of other streams which flow into Lake Taupo and account for nearly 56% of the discharge from that lake into the Waikato, the question of the origin of the Waikato river upstream of Lake Taupo seems to be more academic than practical.</field><field name="date">1973</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270400 Botany</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1409</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Multimodal (im)politeness: the verbal, prosodic and non-verbal realization of disagreement in German and New Zealand English</field><field name="creator">Stadler, Stefanie Alexa</field><field name="description">The present study takes a multimodal approach to speech act analysis. It investigates the disagreeing behaviour of Germans and New Zealanders exhibited during televised panel discussions on a verbal, prosodic, and non-verbal level. More specifically, the present study aims to uncover whether there are differences in the use of prosodic and non-verbal cues between the two groups and if potential differences influence how polite a disagreement is perceived to be. The investigation showed that, on a verbal level, Germans have a preference for more concise disagreements, with a more direct and explicit disagreeing style, producing a large number of strengthening devices, while New Zealanders produce more indirect disagreements, containing a large number of softening devices. Prosodically, the Germans differ from the New Zealanders by using audibly loud and fast speech significantly more frequently, while the two groups&#8217; use of mean pitch, pitch range and intensity range differs little. On a non-verbal level, Germans produce significantly more non-verbal cues during disagreements than their New Zealand counterparts. The main difference between the two groups, however, lies in how their disagreeing behaviour differs from their non-verbal behaviour in neutral speech. While Germans use significantly fewer non-verbal cues in neutral speech than in disagreements and also use a much more limited range of non-verbal cues, the New Zealanders&#8217; non-verbal behaviour in disagreements differs little from their behaviour in neutral speech. In order to test the effect of these differences on the perceived level of politeness, two questionnaires were developed; one prosodic questionnaire testing the effects of loud and fast speech in disagreements on the perceived level of politeness and one non-verbal questionnaire testing the effect of a large number of non-verbal cues on the perceived level of politeness. The results show that fast and loud speech has a negative effect on politeness, as perceived by New Zealanders. A large number of non-verbal cues only appear to have a negative effect on the level of politeness, as perceived by New Zealanders, when disagreements exhibit a high level of involvement and emotion. Overall, it appears that German disagreeing behaviour is likely to be perceived negatively by New Zealanders.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1766</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Images and appraisals of New Zealand 1839-1855: a cognitive-behavioural approach to historical geography</field><field name="creator">Johnston, Judith Anne</field><field name="description">This dissertation considers the images and appraisals of New Zealand in the period 1839 to 1855. The expectations of British emigrants were examined in terms of the information available about New Zealand, the nature, accessibility and dissemination of information, and the images about the new environment created in the accessible sources of information. These expectations, largely drawn from the images, are compared with the appraisals made by the emigrants after arrival and settlement. The dissertation was developed at three levels: as an historical geography using a cognitive-behavioural approach, being concerned with the relationships between information, images, and appraisals, and examining a specific process - emigration to New Zealand from 1839 to 1855. In light of the recent anxiety and pessimism over the future and direction of historical geography, the use of new concepts and methodologies has been regarded as a necessity. While there are many problems and complexities inherent in the use of a cognitive-behavioural approach to historical geography, the concepts of perception, image, and appraisal offer much to the understanding of how man evaluated and behaved in the world of the past. It is suggested that the use of relevant cognitive-behavioural ideas broadens the areas for research by offering a new perspective to the past and by encouraging the use of much previously unused material. The second concern was the relationship between information and image and between image and appraisal. The role of information was found to be most important in the development of images about the new environment. The appraisals also reflected the information contained within the images. It was suggested that it is impossible to reconstruct images of the environment in their totality but that it is possible to reconstruct simpler sub-images of specific features in the environment. It is in this manner that the historical geographer can make a major contribution to the understanding of man&#8217;s behaviour, in relation to the geography of past times. The third concern was with the process of emigration to New Zealand in the period 1839 to 1855. Although much information about New Zealand was available, the intending emigrants had access only to limited sources of information, much of which was promotional in nature. The images of the physical environment were largely drawn from these sources. These images appear to have been the basis of the expectations of most of the emigrants. The later appraisals made of the physical environment showed a close relationship to the images, although several discrepancies occurred. These discrepancies reflected the distortion of information, the role of imagination and the personal evaluations of different sources of information. Emigration to New Zealand in the period 1839 to 1855 was, therefore, examined in terms of the images and appraisals made of the new environment. While general satisfaction with the new homeland was expressed, few of the emigrants considered New Zealand to be an &#8216;Eden of the South Seas&#8217;.</field><field name="date">1975</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370400 Human Geography</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1424</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Formation, Transformative Learning &amp; Theological Education</field><field name="creator">Sorensen, Christine Alison</field><field name="description">This research applied Mezirow&#8217;s transformative learning theory to theological education, in particular in situations where theological education is concerned with the purpose of formation. A field study among minority Christian women attending a Bible school in Pakistan found that the transformative pedagogy contributed to the formational aspects of the theological education programme and helped to integrate the fragmented curriculum, and the separation of theology and spirituality. Students&#8217; epistemological, theological, and personal assumptions were identified at the beginning of the course and changes in these assumptions tracked over the year of study. Five areas of formation, namely relationship with God, thinking theologically, communicating the gospel, relationships with others, and self-understanding, were identified as a way of assessing how changes in assumptions impacted on formational change. Transformation occurred over the range of assumptions and areas of formation. Students&#8217; assumption change was found to be idiosyncratic, responding to the transformative environment created by the teachers, according to particular developmental and formational needs students had. Fostering reflective ability, and the inclusion of reflection activities, as well as mentoring, contributed to students&#8217; formation in the use of transformative learning pedagogy. Transformative learning proved effective even among students with less developed cognitive ability. The South Asian earthquake of 2005 was a significant trigger event which impacted on student formation in developing care and concern, understanding ministry, theodicy, and in developing epistemological complexity. Implications for further research on the use of transformative learning in different theological education settings, and to compare changes over a longer term are also considered.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Theological education</field><field name="subject">transformative learning</field><field name="subject">Formation</field><field name="subject">Pakistan</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2127</field></doc><doc><field name="title">High-Wire Dancers: Middle-Class Pakeha and Dutch Childhoods in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Tap, Relinde</field><field name="description">In contemporary New Zealand discourses the 1950s, 1960s and the early 1970s are seen as the era of the &#8216;Golden Weather&#8217;.  This time came to an end when social change on an unprecedented scale took place from the end of the 1960s onwards.  During the 1980s and 1990s the changes became very rapid due to transformations as part of the neoliberal reforms.  Neoliberalism established new ways of governing the self through discourses of personal reflection, flexibility and choice as well notions of uncertainty, instability and risk.  Risk discourses can be found at different junctures in New Zealand&#8217;s history, but contemporary discourses surrounding the self and childhood have shifted risk discourses in new ways.  This has led to new regimes of rationality and practices of childhood and an increased governance of children and their families.  This research documents the contexts and the interrelationships which influenced the new regimes of rationality and governance of childhoods in New Zealand.  It also discusses the way a range of contradictory and conflictual cultural repertoires are negotiated and reproduced in the middle classes. In the last decades Pakeha and Dutch middle-class families in New Zealand have faced the prospect of declining fortunes.  They have therefore adopted a cultural logic of childrearing which stresses the concerted cultivation of children.  These regimes of concerted cultivation include risk discourses which affect everyday relationships and practices.  This more global middle-class regime coexists with a local regime based on the New Zealand narrative of the time of the &#8216;Golden Weather&#8217;.  Within this local repertoire a &#8216;typical&#8217; New Zealand childhood is seen as safe and quite relaxed.  This perceived childhood space is filled with beaches and other activities associated with nature which give children the opportunity and freedom to explore and develop a distinct Kiwi self.  This local figuration is in contradiction with the often hectic pace of concerted cultivation and the anxieties surrounding risk discourses.  Dutch middle-class parents in New Zealand also use concerted cultivation and they have adopted some of their host country&#8217;s figurations surrounding childhood and the outdoors.  However, there is a difference in emphasis as Dutch parental narratives of self are more focussed on relationships with people rather than nature.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">New Zealand, Childhood; Cultural Repertoires; Class; Governance, Neoliberalism; Risk</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1517</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Attentional responses during discrimination learning by retarded children</field><field name="creator">Singh, Nirbhay Nand</field><field name="description">In Experiment I, eight mentally retarded children were trained on a simultaneous two-choice discrimination problem and a series of discrimination-shift problems. Subjects performed overt observing responses to produce elements of the discriminative stimuli, making it possible to measure directly changes in attention to different aspects of stimuli during learning. The patterns of change in observing responses were generally in line with descriptions of attentional changes derived from two-process theories of discrimination learning; for example, the frequency of irrelevant observing responses was high during the pre-solution period during extradimensional shifts but was low during intradimensional shifts. Contrary to current theories, extradimensional shifts caused an immediate increase in irrelevant responses, and intradimensional shifts caused an increase in relevant observing responses. Subjects responded to later shift problems by initially increasing both relevant and irrelevant observing responses, then withholding irrelevant observing responses. Experiment II examined the effects of three variables, the provision and non-provision of a mechanical observing response, the stimulus dimensionality, and degrees of relevance of the irrelevant stimuli, on the discrimination learning and transfer performance of sixteen mentally retarded children. The subjects were trained on simultaneous two-choice discrimination problems using complex stimuli containing either dimensional stimuli or mixed- &#8216;dimensional stimuli. Subjects were then tested on either intradimensional or extradimensional shifts. When dimensional stimuli were used, intradimensional shifts were easier than extradimensional shifts but when mixed-dimensional stimuli were used, the relative difficulty of the intradimensional and extradimensional shifts depended on whether observing-response buttons were provided. When observing-response buttons were provided, intradimensional shifts were again easier than extradimensional shifts but when these buttons were not provided, intradimensional shifts were harder than extradimensional shifts. The relative ease of intradimensional over extradimensional shifts was found to be further affected by the degree of relevance of the less-relevant dimension. The superiority of the intradimensional over extradimensional shift performance was progressively reduced and then eliminated as the degree of relevance of the irrelevant dimension was gradually increased. Subproblem analysis showed that subjects typically treated subproblems independently, even though there was some degree of dimensional analysis of stimuli, and intradimensional shifts were usually easier than extradimensional shifts. This finding is inconsistent with the usual interpretation of the relative ease of intradimensional over extradimensional shifts as an indication of non independence of subproblems.</field><field name="date">1978</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1450</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The ecology of two New Zealand opisthobranch molluscs</field><field name="creator">Willan, R.

Field assessments were made of recruitment, growth (by recapture of tagged individuals), density, crawling rate, gonad index and mortality. These data allowed monthly estimates of the entire population within the entire study area (2.76 ha) to be made. Complementary laboratory studies investigated acceptable foods and an energy budget including data on energy of the food, growth rates, egestion, respiration and assimilation efficiency were also obtained in the laboratory. In conjunction with these studies, field work on the algal food of A. dactylomela (species of Laurencia) elucidated the entities present, their separate yearly changes in biomass and the causes. From this information, data on food requirements for A. dactylomela.ha-1 month-1 are contrasted with standing crop estimates for Laurencia spp. in the same units to permit consideration of the theoretical grazing effects of A. dactylomela. Several lines of evidence show this environment to be suboptimal for A. dactylomela. storms account for the greatest mortality, but some losses are due to predation by the asteroid Coscinasterias calamaria (Gray). Few individuals reach reproductive maturity and the population is not self-recruiting. An intertidal population of a second opisthobranch, the Cephalaspidean Haminoea zelandiae (Gray in Dieffenbach) was followed for three consecutive years at Motukaraka Island, Hauraki Gulf, New Zealand. Field determinations of growth, annual abundance and reproductive cycles were made. The cryptogamic flora at Motukaraka Island has been characterised and annual patterns of cover and distribution presented for five major seasonal components. The relationship between Haminoea zelandiae and these algae is considered. Additional studies on two less-common anaspideans were carried out. Field data on breeding, growth and density are given for Aplysia parvula M&#246;rch which exists in separate, spatially-isolated intertidal and subtidal populations at Goat Island Bay. For these two populations differences exist in diet, colouration, size distribution, growth and survivorship. The intertidal habitat is marginal whereas the subtidal is close to being optimal. Bursatella leachii Blainville shows variable annual recruitment to the cyanophyte Lyngbya majuscula intertidally at Motukaraka Island. Growth rates have been determined for field and laboratory populations. In the field a deliberate offshore migration takes place whilst L. majuscula is still abundant. Speculations on the possibilities and causes for migrations amongst opisthobranchs are discussed. A taxonomic revision of the New Zealand Anaspidea follows as an appendix.

Some data suggest attending to such errors can have inappropriate effects on learning. A conceptual framework was developed to examine the effects of error attention on the acquisition of proficient reading responses. Analyses of reading behaviour employed concepts and data from 'structural' accounts of reading. These concepts provided details of the components of response systems. Acquisition of proficient reading was seen to involve trends towards accurate integrated responding which becomes self controlled. Error attention was conceptualised as having motivational and informational properties which could directly affect acquisition trends. The first experiment (Chapter Three) demonstrated that under appropriate conditions oral reading behaviour was facilitated by error attention. Eleven year old readers in a Learning Disabilities classroom were measured in their usual reading setting. Two readers received extra tutoring with error attention procedures. A further two readers acted as a contrast for the effects of increased opportunities to respond. These readers received extra practice tutoring with minimum levels of praise. A third subject received no extra tutoring during the course of the experiment. Results indicated that both practice and error attention produced substantial increases in accuracy and correct rates. Accuracy levels were higher for error attention subjects suggesting error attention can have important learning outcomes. Additionally, predictions concerning the error attention dimensions of modeling and prompting were tested. Prompts were found to be more effective with the more proficient reader while models were more effective with the less proficient reader. The second experiment (Chapter Four) examined specific predictions about timing of error attention. Six, 6 year old normal readers received daily sessions of either delayed or immediate attention to errors. Every second day the subjects also read a text on which they were not tutored. Results showed that delayed attention increased the percent of errors self corrected for five subjects in both the tutored and non tutored texts. Increases in self corrections were consistently associated with increased accuracy. The data supported both the predictions and the proposed model of self correction behaviour as having a tutorial or self instruction function. Both experiments were discussed in terms of the functions of error attention in facilitating acquisition of proficient reading. Methodological issues in the behaviour analysis of oral reading were also discussed and implications from the studies for instruction in learning to read are drawn. The usefulness of concepts from 'structural' accounts of reading for a predictive 'functional' account of error attention is examined in a concluding section.</field><field name="date">1978</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1464</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Geophysical exploration of Quaternary ironsand deposits at Taharoa, Waikato North Head and Raglan, west coast, North Island, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Lawton, Donald Caleb</field><field name="description">Extensive beach and dune deposits of titanomagnetite sands occur along the west coast of the North Island of New Zealand. Some of the larger deposits cover an area of greater than 10 km2, with a thickness greater than 50 metres. Deposits at Taharoa, Waikato North Head and Raglan were investigated to determine whether geophysical methods can be used to delineate titanomagnetite concentration patterns within the deposits and also to assess the total reserves of titanomagnetite in each deposit. Laboratory measurements showed that the magnetic susceptibility of the sands increases monotonically with the volume concentration of magnetite CV; the observed variation of magnetic susceptibility as a function of CV can be explained by changes in the resultant magnetic permeability of a binary mixture of magnetic and non-magnetic grains. The density of the sand increases linearly with CV; the particle density of titanomagnetite is 4.7 x 103 kg m-3. The natural remanence of magnetite sands is small (Koenigsberger ratio Q&lt;0.2). No significant induced polarization response could be observed even for mixtures of almost pure magnetite. When placed in an electric field, the magnetite sands were found to be non-conductive. Field measurements showed that total magnetic force anomalies with peak values of up to 1600 nT and 800 nT could be observed over the deposits during aeromagnetic surveys at elevations of 183 m and 366 m respectively. Topographic anomalies were subtracted from the observed data, assuming an average concentration of 18% magnetite for sands in the deposits dawn to an arbitrary datum level. The resulting residual anomalies are caused entirely by sand which is enriched in magnetite (commonly up to 45% to 50% by weight). At Taharoa, the enriched sands were modelled by a 33 x 13 array of vertical prisms (200 m x 200 m dimension), retaining the length and magnetization of each prism as parameter. At Waikato North Head and Raglan, the enriched sands were modelled by three-dimensional polygonal bodies. Ground magnetic studies are suitable for outlining particular magnetite concentration patterns, such as in streams or on beaches. Magnetite concentration patterns Rave gravitational effects of up to &#177;1 mgal, which are distorted by interfering gravitational effects from basement structures at Taharoa and by a strong regional gradient at Waikato Heads. However, the gravity data at Taharoa could be interpreted in terms of basement depths, whereas at Waikato North Head, gravity anomalies outline magnetite-enriched sub-deposits which occur below sea level. Concentration patterns above sea level at Waikato North Head could not be accurately defined from the gravity data. Seismic refraction studies showed that the Taharoa deposit is up t o 200 m thick. The seismic velocity in the drifting surface sands increases linearly with depth, from a surface velocity of 0.24 km sec-1 to a maximum of 0.65 km sec-1, with a rate of increase varying from 19 to 30 sec-1. These sands are underlain by a weakly cemented, homogeneous sand unit which has a velocity of 1.7 &#177; 0.1 km sec-1 and has a titanomagnetite concentration of less than 18% by weight. The two sand members are separated by a sequence of tephras and paleosols. Values of DC-resistivity observed over the deposits exceed 104 ohm-m in dry sand and are as low as 102 ohm-m in saturated clay- bound sands. Small frequency effects of up to 14% were observed in clean sands at Taharoa. Magnetite sand deposits can be successfully prospected by geophysical methods. Airborne magnetic surveys are most applicable; a flightline spacing of 0.5 km allows magnetite concentration patterns with wavelengths greater than 200 m to be resolved. The seismic refraction method delineates the vertical extent of the deposits. Gravity, ground magnetic and electrical methods can be used to test specific objectives. Electromagnetic methods were found to be unsuitable for the prospecting of ironsand deposits. Ore reserves of magnetite calculated from the interpretation of the geophysical data were found to be significantly greater than previous estimates. At Taharoa, a total mass of 545 x 106 tonnes of enriched sand with an average magnetite concentration of 38% was calculated from geophysical data. Three major and three minor sub-deposits of enriched sands, containing a total of 580 x 106 tonnes with an average concentration of 46% magnetite are indicated from similar data at Waikato North Head; of these, two major sub-deposits, which occur below Sea level and which contain 230 x 106 tonnes of sand (114 x 106 tonnes of magnetite) were not previously known. The ore reserves at Raglan amount to 56 x 106 tonnes with an average concentration of 36% titanomagnetite. As well as the enriched sands, all three deposits also contain large reserves of low-grade magnetite sand. It is postulated that a large proportion of the magnetite sands which have accumulated along the west coast of the North Island may have been derived from the erosion of extensive Quaternary tephra sheets which originated from numerous centres in the Central Volcanic Zone.</field><field name="date">1979</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::260000 Earth Sciences::260100 Geology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1479</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The interaction between nerve and muscle during metamorphosis of the Waxmoth Galleria mellonella</field><field name="creator">Ward, Clare</field><field name="description">This thesis is concerned with the interaction between the nervous system and muscles during the metamorphosis of the waxmoth Galleria mellonella. The mesothoracic dorsolongitudinal muscles of the waxmoth arise from dorsal muscles in the larval mesothorax. Several of these dorsal larval muscles begin their transformation shortly before the larva-pupa ecdysis when: they break down to be replaced by presumptive myoblasts. These appear to arise from the nuclei of the larval muscle. In the 60-72 hours pupa all three mesothoracic dorsolongitudinal. (2dl) muscles are made up of the characteristic number of fibres and the first dorsolongtudinal muscle (dl1) has its characteristic adult shape. From the 82 hour stage onwards the muscle fibres increase in diameter until the 168 hour stage when the muscles have achieved the adult condition. Cautery of the first thoracic ganglion of the larva or section of the nerve cord between the first two thoracic ganglia leads to an adult in which most of the 2dl muscles are absent. Only the dorsal part of 2dl1 is present as normal. Up until the 24 hours pupa cautery of the first thoracic ganglion has the same results as cautery of the larva. Cautery of the 25-30 hours pupa results in an adult in which the ventral fasciculae of 2dl1 are represented by a few tiny muscle fibres. At this stage there is no sign o f 2dl2 or 2dl3 except for a few small cells which are about the same size as presumptive myoblasts. Cautery of the 40 hours pupa leads to an adult in which all of the 2dl1 fasciculae are present as smaller versions o f the normal case. Up until the 108 hours pupa cautery of the first thoracic ganglion leads to an adult in which the 2dl1 muscles are smaller than normal. An ultrastructural investigation of the small cells found in the denervated adult in the place of the 2dl muscles showed these to be similar to presumptive myoblasts. It therefore appears that the nervous system affects the ability of the presumptive myoblasts both to differentiate and then to grow as normal. Denervation of the fifth and sixth instar larvae by section of one of the connectives between the first two thoracic ganglia has the same effect on the operated side as denervation of the last larval instar. Cobalt staining of the nerve supplying the dorsal muscles of the larva shows that the motor neuron complement in both the fifth and seventh in star larvae is very similar. Cobalt staining of the nerve to the 2dl muscles of the adult reveals cell bodies which are similar in position and size to those found in the larva. The interaction between nerve and muscle during development in insects and vertebrates is discussed. From this work it is hypothesized that the nervous system affects muscle development by preventing mitosis in the presumptive myoblasts. It is also hypothesised that the adult muscles are served by the same motor neurons which were present in the later instars of the larva.</field><field name="date">1977</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270500 Zoology::270505 Entomology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1474</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Psychology of environmental attitudes: a cross-cultural study of their content and structure</field><field name="creator">Milfont, Taciano Lemos</field><field name="description">Environmental attitudes (EA) are a psychological tendency that is expressed by evaluating perceptions of or beliefs regarding the natural environment, including factors affecting its quality, with some degree of favour or disfavour. Research on EA has been critised as being noncumulative and atheoretical. This thesis addresses these critics by taking a systematic approach to the study of the psychology of EA, and had three specific objectives. First, it sets out to investigate the cognitive structure of EA, that is, what kind of perceptions or beliefs regarding the natural environment people have, how these perceptions or beliefs can be operationalized in terms of dimensions, or psychological constructs, and how these dimensions relate to each other. Second, it sets out to investigate the nomological network of EA, that is, to test causal models of antecedents and consequences of EA by investigating their relationships with socio-demographic (e.g., gender, religiosity), psychological (e.g., social desirability, authoritarianism) and environmentally related variables (e.g., ecological behaviour, inclusion with nature). And finally, it sets out to examine the value/threat&#8211;attitude&#8211;behaviour causal model, in which EA are deemed to fully mediate the influence of values and perceived environmental threat on ecological behaviour. Three cross-sectional empirical studies were carried out, involving a total of 2,150 student and general population participants. Study 1, conducted in New Zealand, tests the dimensionality and hierarchical structure of EA. Study 2a, also conducted in New Zealand, involves the development of a new culture-general and fully-balanced tool, the Environmental Attitudes Inventory (EAI), for measuring EA. Study 2b, a Web-based survey conducted in Brazil, assesses the validity and reliability of the EAI in this different cultural context. Study 2c, also a Web-based survey conducted with participants from more than fifty countries, describes the development of a short-form of the measure (EAI-S) and assesses its validity and test-retest reliability in this diverse sample. Study 3 tests the validity, reliability and measurement invariance of the EAI-S across samples from Brazil, New Zealand and South Africa. This cross-cultural study also investigates iii causal models of antecedents and consequences of EA, and the value/threat&#8211;attitude&#8211;behaviour causal model across these cultures. Taken together, these studies demonstrated the following: (1) EA are a multidimensional construct organized in a hierarchical fashion, with first-order factors either loading on a secondorder factor (i.e., Generalized Environmental Attitudes) or loading on either one of two correlated second-order factors (i.e., Preservation and Utilization). (2) Individuals with pro-EA are those who are older, female and members of an environmental organization, who attribute greater importance to self-transcendence, biospheric and altruistic values, who conserve the environment by performing ecological behaviours, who feel connected with nature and concerned about threats from environmental problems, and who support sustainability principles. Individuals with anti-EA, in contrast, are those who are Judeo-Christians, who have higher levels of religiosity and beliefs in the Bible, who support economic liberalism and political conservatism, and who attribute greater importance to traditional and self-enhancement values. (3) Altruistic values, perceived environmental threat (both positively), and self-enhancement values (negatively) are strong predictors of EA, and EA fully mediates the influence of values and threat on ecological behaviour. Overall, this research has a number of implications. These include (1) the development of a research framework for the study of EA that considers their contents in both their horizontal and vertical structures, (2) the development of the EAI for measuring these contents and structures, (3) the indication that pro-EA still tends to be limited to certain groups within society, which would tend to constrain the resolution of environmental problems, (4) the confirmation of the relevance of both human values and perceived environmental threat in the formation and determination of EA, and (5) support for the mediating role of EA on the influence of values and threat on ecological behaviour.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1712</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sexual abuse investigation and criminal court processes: doing justice to the child?</field><field name="creator">Davies, Emma</field><field name="description">This thesis has contributed to the international literature on child sexual abuse investigation and criminal justice processes by conducting a programme evaluation of these processes in Auckland, New Zealand. In the first part of the study, 51 child complainants and 124 primary carers were interviewed about their perceptions of social work investigation, evidential interviewing, access to counselling services, police investigation, medical examinations and, for some, criminal court proceedings. Although participants were predominantly satisfied with early interactions with professionals, both children and primary carers highlighted the need for better interagency collaboration, reduced time delays throughout the process, earlier access to support services, more information and increased involvement in decision making. With specific reference to criminal court, participants indicated a need for better pre-court education and debriefing. The second part of this research involved analyses of criminal court transcripts on the ways that children are questioned by evidential interviewers and lawyers in court. The transcript analyses showed that some cross-examination strategies are reliant on prejudicial stereotypes of children and false assumptions about the dynamics of sexual abuse. In combination, the interviews and transcript analyses, indicate that Judges could usefully ensure that children are asked questions in terms they understand. The thesis revealed deficiencies within agency practices and, to a lesser extent, agency policies which impact negatively on children and their families during the sexual abuse investigation and criminal justice processes. It was shown that in practice these processes do not fully comply with Article 3(1) of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, in that the best interests of the child are not always 'of primary consideration'. Recommendations to address some of these deficiencies were proposed.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1764</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Population dynamics of the scallop Pecten novaezelandiae in the Hauraki Gulf</field><field name="creator">Morrison, Mark Andrew</field><field name="description">The population biology and ecology of scallops in Greater Omaha Bay (a semi-oceanic bay) and Kawau Bay (a estuarine bay) was quantified by observation and experiment. Information was collected to extend the knowledge base on northern New Zealand scallop population dynamics, and for application to potential scallop enhancement in the region. Contagious scallop population organisation was found at all spatial scales examined, ranging from bay wide through to individual bed patchiness, down to the scale of inter-animal distances. Such clumping has strong implications for a range of population processes, including fishing susceptibility and fertilisation success. Monitoring of adults found two main spawning events to occur; in late October and in mid January. Changes in the gonado-somatic index (GSI) were well synchronised between individuals within populations. Subsequent monitoring of spat-fall in artificial collectors documented two main recruitment events, probably the outcomes of the two local spawning events. These spat-fall events occurred on collectors separated by 1Os of km. However, substantial density variations occurred between sites, indicating that local hydrodynamics may have played a significant role in modifying local spat-fall intensities. Smaller spat-fall events were also present between the two major events. The number of spat collected at a number of combinations of site and time were sufficient to support commercial spat catching operations, although problems were encountered with spat detaching at sizes too small to be retained by the collectors. In the 1993/94 summer a large algal bloom event completely eliminated scallop recruitment to collectors for the first three months of that season. Mass mortality events were a major contributor to overall benthic scallop population mortality. Probable causes included intensive scallop harvesting (commercial and recreational), a major storm episode, and a large algal bloom. These effectively eliminated scallop populations from Greater Omaha Bay. The adjacent Kawau Bay was not affected by any of these particular events, but populations there did not survive long after reaching adult sizes. Estimates of M (natural mortality) were higher for all scallop populations than have been previously documented in New Zealand studies. Growth trajectories were reasonably consistent in waters shallower than 19 m, but a progressive decline occurred in both maximal size reached and average growth rates with increasing depth after this point. Food limitation may have been the mechanism involved, which is likely to vary significantly for other locations depending on local environmental conditions. Average time to recruitment to the fishery (100 mm shell width) was three years for the shallower populations. A slight reduction in average size of adults at higher densities was found for some populations, indicating a possible density-dependent effect. Examination of a high density scallop bed found animals to display distinctive substratum preferences over small spatial scales, with higher abundances occurring on coarser materials such as shell gravel, marl and grit. Mud was not favoured as a habitat type. Movements of tagged animals at this location were spatially limited to within the particular habitat patch in which an individual was tagged and released, i.e. at a scale of 1s to 1Os of metres. No animals moved between adjacent patches of similar habitat (100 m scale). A B.A.C.I type experiment was undertaken to assess incidental mortality effects of commercial scallop dredging on undersize scallops, at the spatial scale of beds. Significant negative effects were quantified, with the number of undersize animals killed per legal animal harvested estimated at 1.7 and 2.8 : 1, depending on the size frequency structure of the fished bed. Modelling of likely improvements in the number of animals surviving at the end of fishing, given a reduction in the minimum legal size from 100 to 90 mm, indicated improvements of 20 to 41% of the original population remaining after fishing, depending on animal size and assumed dredge efficiencies, A 90 mm MLS has subsequently been adopted by the Coromandel Scallop Fishery. The results from this work provide detailed population based estimates of parameters required for successful management and optimal harvesting strategies of Hauraki Gulf scallop populations. The large variability in parameters such as mortality, and strong abundance correlations with habitat type, has strong implications for such activities. This work also provides essential information for the undertaking of locally based enhancement operations, such as the spatial and temporal magnitude and variability of spat-fall events, and growth rates with respect to habitat features (i.e. depth).</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270700 Ecology and Evolution::270702 Marine and estuarine ecology (incl. marine ichthyology)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1706</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Vincent Ward: the emergence of an aesthetic</field><field name="creator">Read, Lynette</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the work and career of New Zealand director, Vincent Ward, focusing on the emergence of his distinctive aesthetic. It places this aesthetic in the context of local and European artistic and filmic traditions (in particular, certain forms of Romanticism and Expressionism) that have influenced Ward's work. It also explores how his childhood and education may have shaped his approach, and examines what his aesthetic has meant in practice, in the process of making each of his major films, as well as in the formal characteristics of the completed films. The study focuses to a greater extent on his early (New Zealand) films as case studies that help us to understand the development of his practice and theory. The career of Ward as a filmmaker who has had a significant influence on the development of the New Zealand film industry is also explored in the light of what may differentiate his approach from that of other local filmmakers and the extent to which it is useful to think of him as a "New Zealand filmmaker". This thesis draws from extensive primary research in the form of interviews with the director, his family, associates and collaborators (cameramen, editors, co-writers, producers and so on). Textual study has involved the viewing New Zealand and Expressionist films and art-works, and the examination of archival and unpublished material. Secondary research has included coverage of European and local artistic and filmic traditions and, the relatively limited body of criticism of Ward's films. While this thesis takes an essentially auteurist approach - identifying characteristic themes, visual motifs and stylistic tendencies - it also seeks to expand and reposition such an approach by taking into account intellectual and cultural history, the contributions of Ward's collaborators, and the complex industrial conditions in which his films were produced. To do so has necessitated a close examination of the filmmaking process. By examining the aesthetic of such a director - known for his heightened individualism, perfectionism, and unusual methods - this study has sought to reveal the strengths and limitations of classic auteur theory, suggesting ways in which this approach can be modified and re-invigorated. The thesis also provides a case study in the difficulties faced by a director of this kind in finding a satisfactory base within the contemporary film industry. The alignment of local and global interests and investments is still a highly complex business.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1509</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterisation of mycoviruses in the plant pathogenic fungus, Botrytis cinerea</field><field name="creator">Howitt, Robyn L.J.</field><field name="description">ln recent years a lot of interest has focussed on the role of mycoviruses (fungal viruses) that confer reduced pathogenicity to their fungal hosts. In several plant pathogenic fungi viral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) elements have been shown to be the agents responsible for this attenuation of virulence. In New Zealand and other temperate climates the plant pathogenic fungus, Botrytis cinerea is an important pathogen of many horticultural crops. Control of this grey mould disease still relies heavily on the use of fungicides to augment cultural practices- Consequently, there is now increasing interest in the use of biological control as an alternative means of control. This study reports the first large-scale survey of dsRNA elements in B. cinerea. Analysis of 200 New Zealand isolates from a range of hosts revealed 72% contained dsRNA, with high variation in dsRNA profiles, both within and between groups of fungal isolates from different hosts. DsRNA has been associated with isometric particles in many different fungi. In this study virus-like particles (VLPs) were observed in three of five dsRNA-containing isolates examined. Morphological types included isometric particles of varying size classes (approx' 30, 35, 40 and 45 nm) and bacilliform parricles (approx. 25 x 63 nm). In five isolates apparently lacking dsRNA no isometric or bacilliform particles were found but flexuous rods with a modal length of approx. 7ZO nm were detected in one of these isolates. Total RNA extraction of the various partially purified VLP preparations gave similar profiles to those obtained from mycelial dsRNA extractions of the same isolates, suggesting that the VLPs comprise encapsidated dsRNA. Comparison of 12 dsRNA-containing and 12 dsRNA-free isolates indicated slight differences between the two groups in radial growth rate, virulence on bean leaves and sclerotial number, but the differences were minor. ln summary, while dsRNA was found to be common among B. cinerea isolates in this study, the evidence did not reveal any marked phenotypic effects of dsRNA presence. The putative flexuous rod-shaped virus particles rn B. cinerea were studied further. Similar particles have been observed in fungi before but none have been characterised at the molecular level. This study reports the first complete nucleotide sequences of two such mycoviruses, Botrytis Virus F (BVF) and Botrytis Virus X (BVX), and also the first molecular characterisation of viruses infecting B. cinerea. The mycoviruses, which were both present in the same B. cinerea isolate, were similar in size and morphology to ssRNA plant viruses of the family Potexviridae. BVF and BVX contained ssRNA genomes af 6827 and 6966 nucleotides respectively, excluding poly(A) tails. Computer analysis of the genomic cDNA sequence of BVF revealed three potential open reading frames (ORFs) encoding putative proteins of 20 kDa (ORFI),212 kDa (ORFZ) and 32 kDa (ORF3). ORFI, which overlapped ORF2 by 467 nt, did not reveal significant homology with known protein sequences.O RF2, which showed significant sequence identity to the replicase proteins of the plant virus families Tymoviridae and potexviridae, contained a putative opal readthrough codon intermediate between the helicase and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RDRP) regions. ORF3 shared amino acid homology with coat proteins of the family Potexviridae. A putative defective RNA (D RNA) of 829 nt was also detected which consisted of a 5' region of the parental genome fused in-frame to the terminal 3' end, complete with poly(A) tail. BVX revealed five potential ORFs encoding putative proteins of 158 kDa (ORFl), 30 kDa (ORF2), 44y,Da(ORF3), 14 kDa (ORF4) and l4kDa (ORFs). ORFI showed significant amino acid sequenceid entity to the replicase proteins and ORF3 to the coat proteins of the potexviridae. The remaining ORFs did not reveal significant homology with known protein sequences. This is the first report of sequence similarities between mycoviruses and the plant virus families Potexviridae and Tymoviridae. Comparisons of sequence and genome organisation suggest that the mycoviruses BVF and BVX may each belong to a new as yet unassigned genus in the plant virus family Potexviridae. An unexpected result from this study was the high level of identity observed between the derived amino acid sequences of the mycoviruses and plant viruses including a region of -7O% for the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RDRP) region of BVX and similar regions in several potex-like viruses of AIIium spp. This high level of interviral homology has not previously been reported between the plant and fungal kingdoms and is possibly indicative of a recent divergence from a common ancestor. These results suggest that horizontal gene transfer between the plant and fungal kingdoms may occur more frequently than has been appreciated to date. If so it may play a significant role in viral evolution. In addition to providing novel phylogenetic information on the relationship between these morphological types of viruses in fungi and in plants, characterisation of these mycoviral genomes provides a possible strategy for incorporating genes into Botrytis using viruses as vectors. In this context Botrytis strains infected with modified viruses could provide a new approach for the biocontrol of grey mould.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1765</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Asymmetric synthesis using 4,4,6-trimethyl-1,3-dioxanes</field><field name="creator">Lorimer, Rachel Manu</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1763</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Spat production of the Greenshell&#8482; mussel Perna canaliculus in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Buchanan, Samuel J.</field><field name="description">The research presented in this thesis was undertaken in order to develop an understanding of the biology of Perna canaliculus sufficient to allow for commercial hatchery based production of Greenshell&#8482; mussel spat. Hatchery production is an alternative to unreliable and inconsistent wild spat collection. In a Perna canaliculus population followed for one year spawning occurred in early spring and late summer. Three quantitative histological measures of gonad maturity utilising image analysis technology and a qualitative classification system were compared. Measuring the relative surface area comprised of gametes on histological sections was found to be the most reliable method. A practical gonad visual index to determine the reproductive condition of adults for the selection of broodstock was developed and found to be highly effective as a means of predicting induced spawning success. Serotonin was not effective for inducing spawning of Perna canaliculus. Temperature shock and the use of stripped gametes was however found to be a reliable spawning induction method. Relative gamete concentration, gamete age, temperature, sperm half life and gamete contact times were all found to have effects on fertilisation success for Perna canaliculus. Sperm concentration and the conditions of sperm aging were particularly important. Fertilisation kinetics of Perna canaliculus gametes modelled using the Vogel-Czihak-Chang-Wolf method suggested that 5% of sperm-egg contacts lead to successful fertilisation. Broodstock management protocols that could be used to condition the adult of Perna canaliculus were investigated in order to enhance and prolong the natural reproductive season. Research suggested that for successful broodstock conditioning animals should already have begun gametogenesis at the time conditioning is commenced. Successful conditioning of Perna canaliculus was achieved at temperatures between l0 and 16&#176;C over a period of about 50 days. A diet ration above 2-3% of the dry meat mass per day is suggested. A trial examining non-algal diet supplements suggest a mixture of yeast and lipid emulsion may have some potential value. Photoperiod manipulation did not effect the reproductive condition of Perna canaliculus. The yield of veliger larvae was significantly enhanced if embryo culture water was treated with 1.0 mg/l EDTA. Veliger yield was not significantly affected at densities below 50 embryos/ml. Perna canaliculus larvae grew most rapidly and survived well at the salinity of 35 ppt. Larvae grew most rapidly when cultured at low densities. Experiments suggest that early larvae can be cultured at 5-10/ml, however late stage larvae grew most rapidly when cultured at l/ml. Perna canaliculus larvae displayed best growth and good survival if fed a mixed flagellate-diatom diet comprising Isochrysis galbana (T-Iso) and Chaetoceros calcitrans. The optimal diet ration, as a function of larval size, increased from about 20 cells/&#956;l Isochrysis galbana (T-Iso) to around 150 cells/&#956;l through the larval development period. Thyroxine between the concentrations of l0-5 and l0-8 M did not have an observable effect on larval developmental rate or eye spot development. Down welling settlement systems were found to be generally successful for Perna canaliculus lanrae. L-DOPA was also demonstrated to enhance the settlement and metamorphosis of Perna canaliculus pediveligers.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270700 Ecology and Evolution::270702 Marine and estuarine ecology (incl. marine ichthyology)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1707</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ordinary Men and Uncommon Women : A History of Psychiatric Nursing in New Zealand Public Mental Hospitals, 1939-1972</field><field name="creator">Prebble, Catherine Mary (Kate)</field><field name="description">This social-cultural history explores the changing context, culture, and identity of psychiatric nurses working in New Zealand public mental hospitals between 1939 and 1972. Primary documentary sources and oral history interviews provided the data for analysis. The thesis is divided into two periods: 1939 to 1959 when asylum-type conditions shaped the culture of the institutional workforce, and 1960 to 1972 when mental health reform and nursing professionalisation challenged the isolation and distinct identity of mental hospital nurses. Between 1939 and 1959 the introduction of somatic treatments did not substantially change nursing practice in mental hospitals. Overcrowding, understaffing and poor resources necessitated the continuance of custodial care. The asylum-type institutions were dependent on a male attendant workforce to ensure the safety of disturbed male patients, and the maintenance of hospital farms, gardens, and buildings. Although female nurses provided all the care and domestic work on the female side, the belief that psychiatric nursing was physically demanding, potentially dangerous, and morally questionable, characterised the work as generally unsuitable for women. Introduction of psychiatric nursing registration which was a move toward professionalisation did little to change the dominance of a male, working-class culture. From 1960 to 1972 psychiatric nurses&#8217; identity was contested. New therapeutic roles created the possibility of the nurses becoming health professionals. Their economic security and occupational power, however, was tied to an identity as unionised, male workers. As psychiatric nurses were drawn closer to the female-dominated nursing profession through health service changes and nursing education reform, both men and women acted to protect both their working conditions and their patients&#8217; welfare. To achieve these ends, they employed working-class means of industrial action. By accepting the notion that psychiatric nurses&#8217; identity was socially constructed, this thesis provides an interpretation that goes beyond the assumption that nursing is a woman&#8217;s profession. Instead, it presents psychiatric nursing as a changing phenomenon shaped by contested discourses of gender, class and professionalisation. Nursing in public mental hospitals attracted ordinary men and uncommon women whose collective identity was forged from the experience of working in a stigmatised role.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321200 Public Health and Health Services::321204 Mental health</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1516</field></doc><doc><field name="title">New Zealand's Relations With Northeast Asia: Links and Interactions Under Globalisation</field><field name="creator">Stringer, Christina A</field><field name="description">In the mid-1980s New Zealand embarked on a path of radical economic reform. The changes that occurred and are still occurring in New Zealand are in part, of external origin and came about from an opening of the domestic economy to wider forces thereby re-incorporating New Zealand into the global economy. Le Heron and Pawson (1996) propose that in the 1990s, economic globalization &#8211; the process of integration, deepening and differentiation of economic activities throughout the world -- has lead to new links and interactions. In seeking to identify the external and internal forces leading to the development of new links and interactions between New Zealand and Northeast Asia (Japan, Taiwan and Korea), analysis is made of changes occurring within investment, production and trade connections. This thesis is informed by two bodies of literature: the world systems literature stresses the development of inter-country relationships in an historical context, and political economy literature links resource regimes to periods of capitalist accumulation. In order to remain active participants in the global economy New Zealand entreprises and industries are pursuing strategies of linking into the Northeast Asian economies. Two key economic sectors, agro-food and forestry, have been chosen for investigation in order to examine changes as New Zealand industries, enterprises and local regions seek to achieve greater integration into the Northeast Asian region. A re-articulation of production is occurring as New Zealand's agro-food sector is incorporated into a Northeast Asian food import complex. Changing patterns of production and consumption are examined within the context of the food regime perspective. While new opportunities are increasing for New Zealand agro-food exporters, trade still reflects New Zealand's traditional export base of first and second food regime products from the beef and dairy sectors. The expansion of a fresh fruit and vegetable complex represents an emerging third regime. Since the mid-1980s the New Zealand forestry sector has become increasingly integrated into a national complex centered upon Japan. The dismantling of the national regulatory regime introduced a number of foreign investors and subsequently led to the reorganisation of trade and production networks. Prior to this time, forestry exports to Northeast Asia were inconsistent, comprising mostly logs and low value products with processing occurring in Japan. While unprocessed exports remain a significant composition of forestry trade there is a move away from low value products into more end-use-application specific production. This is accompanied by a shift in production facilities and an increase of economic surplus in New Zealand. Land based industries in the Hawkes Bay provide examples of local adaptations of production to agro-food and forestry complexes centred upon Northeast Asia. Integration into these complexes has facilitated access to new markets and resulted in increasing degrees of added value. This has only been possible in the context of the gradual relaxation of regulatory regimes that has occurred over the past two decades. In some cases, integration is an outcome of Northeast Asian ownership of New Zealand based nodes along the commodity chain. In others, it is an outcome of New Zealand actors producing to meet 'site of consumption' demand. In spite of New Zealand's adjustments to globalisation, it essentially remains a semi-peripheral production site.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1642</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The development of models for sustainable fisheries</field><field name="creator">Batstone, Christopher John</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270700 Ecology and Evolution::270702 Marine and estuarine ecology (incl. marine ichthyology)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1713</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Positive and negative perfectionism: two sides of the story: a global or domain-specific construct?</field><field name="creator">Haase, Anne Marie</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1711</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Accelerated iterative blind deconvolution</field><field name="creator">Biggs, David S.C.</field><field name="description">This thesis considers the problem of restoring an image distorted by a linear spatially-invariant point spread function (PSF) and corrupted by noise. A principle aim is to develop techniques that are practical and require a minimum amount of prior knowledge. The process of deconvolution is attempted using least-squares and maximum-likelihood iterative algorithms. A survey of the literature introduces the main techniques for deconvolution when the PSF is known, and various approaches for achieving blind deconvolution &#8211; estimating both the PSF and the underlying object from the blurred observation. The two main areas of focus for this thesis are accelerating iterative image restoration algorithms, and developing blind deconvolution methods for extended objects.  The first main contribution is the development of an acceleration technique to speed the rate of convergence of iterative algorithms that use successive approximation. The acceleration uses a vector extrapolation approach which eliminates the need to compute the gradient of an objective function, or to perform a line search optimization. The performance is comparable to that of conjugate gradient optimization, and an example maximum-entropy restoration reduces the number of iterations from 1,000 to 27. A simple modification to the extrapolation allows the acceleration of the Richardson-Lucy (RL) iteration while implicitly imposing the positivity constraint.  The second contribution is the development of blind deconvolution algorithms that do not require spatial or spectral constraints to produce a solution, and can be used on extended objects. The key to achieving this is to recognise that the image and PSF estimates may required different amounts of restoration. By appropriately weighting the update of the image or PSF estimate a suitable result can be produced. Methods for achieving this using both joint- and alternating-variable optimisation are discussed. Issues regarding scaling of the variables are also addressed.  An iterative blind deconvolution method employing the RL algorithm, vector extrapolation, and different numbers of image and PSF iterations, is used to restore a variety of simulated and real images from terrestrial telescopes, the Hubble Space Telescope, multiframe speckle imaging, 3D wide-field fluorescence and confocal microscopes, and scanning electron microscopes. Methods for coping with Poisson noise corruption, and image boundary artifacts are also discussed.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1760</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Archaeology of a military frontier: Taranaki, New Zealand, 1860-1881</field><field name="creator">Prickett, Nigel</field><field name="description">This thesis describes the archaeology of the European military frontier in the province of Taranaki, New Zealand, in the years 1860-1881. In this period a series of four campaigns resulted in the expansion of European settlement at the expense of the indigenous Maori people. The First Taranaki War (1860-61) did not resolve the fundamental conflict over land and the imposition of British law. The passage of the New Zealand settlements Act in late 1863 brought European military strategy into line with political reality. Henceforth the land of 'rebel' tribes was to be confiscated, the military frontier providing a bulwark for an expanding European farming frontier. The Second Taranaki War (1863-66), the white Cliffs Scare (1869) and the Parihaka Campaign (1880-81) resulted in successive areas of Maori land in Taranaki being brought under European control. The present work is divided into two parts. In the first (Volume 1), the geography and archaeology of the European military effort in Taranaki is described; the fortifications and frontier organization are compared with those of earlier periods of imperial expansion elsewhere in the world, and the techniques employed in New Zealand are shown to be by no means unusual. The second part (Volume 2) reports the results of excavations at two European fortifications of the period. These serve to describe further the archaeology of the Taranaki frontier and also, through the recovered material culture, to demonstrate the dependent relation of the military frontier in New Zealand to the economies of the northern hemisphere.</field><field name="date">1981</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370300 Anthropology</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::430000 History and Archaeology::430100 Historical Studies::430101 History: New Zealand</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1514</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The question of learning to read and write</field><field name="creator">Koefoed, Blair</field><field name="description">This thesis is an investigation into learning to read and write. It is also an investigation into how learning to read and write is investigated. THE PRESENTING PROBLEM Despite literacy being highly valued by every member of a modern society and the immense personal and social effort directed towards bringing it within the grasp of all, its universal occurrence, it remains an elusive goal. INVESTIGATING LITERACY As with many other valued human endeavours, science, with its refined and disciplined way of looking, is enlisted to help improve the achievement of ends, and research is designed and undertaken with the aim of increasing our control over its manifestation in the world. Yet it is the claim of this thesis that by leaving uninvestigated the nature of learning to read and write itself the gains will never be complete. PHILOSOPHICAL INVESTIGATIONS To open different lines of investigation, into things themselves, questioning must free itself of socially driven exigencies and the patterns of the established disciplines of thought and become self-reflexive. Self-referential questioning is traditionally and essentially philosophical and insight is sought from three well known modern representatives of the field. - Heidegger offers reflections on the importance of how questioning is undertaken, and, with his discussions on the nature of truth and how with 'revealing' comes 'concealing' hints at the darker side of literacy as a activity that 'opens' the world. - Wittgenstein's intense thought on language/world relationships potentially clarifies the dissension so characteristic of literacy acquisition research and provides a construct of language that would allow misrepresentations of literacy to occur. - Foucault's historical analyses provide concepts useful when considering the origins of literacy, and 'power' becomes a better explanation for the literacy fervour than the production of finer human beings. THE FINAL QUESTION Finally their amalgamated insights are used to discuss the phenomenon of illiteracy as it is portrayed in a recent novel by Bernard Schlink, The Reader. In this study of post-war Germany, the way literacy is deeply entwined into our social structures becomes clear, but more crucially we learn this about illiteracy - the highly destructive, exaggerated, and excessive reaction to its occurrence has no ready explanation.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1709</field></doc><doc><field name="title">"A Colonial Tale of Fact and Fiction": Nineteenth-Century New Zealand Novels by Women</field><field name="creator">Mackay, Morag</field><field name="description">This thesis plots the emergence and development of the nineteenth-century New Zealand women's novel. Previously silenced in favour of a masculinist nationalist tradition, a renewed interest in our earliest literary foremothers has arisen as a result of feminism. Arguing for their acknowledgement as part of our literary history, this thesis examines the significance of these novels in the recording and formulation of a New Zealand culture and literature. The body of the thesis is constructed of three chapters, each representing a different literary from used by these novelists. The earliest is the adventure story, showcasing New Zealand's flora and fauna for the British reading public, and providing excitement in the from of the New Zealand wars, cannibalism, whaling and natural disasters. Second comes the romance, which portrays the developing colonial society and begins to define what it means to be a "New Zealander". Part B of this chapter discusses the treatment of Maori in these women's novels. It examines a group of romances with part-Maori protagonists, in which the novelists address the issue of the place of Maori in the new society. Last are the didactic novels, in which temperance, religion and women's rights are argued for. This thesis considers the characteristics of each of these forms of novel and examines the social and political contexts that gave rise to these choices. Through their novels these women communicate what it meant to be a colonial New Zealand woman - revealing their views on such issues as colonisation, relationship with Maori, the new "classless" society, marriage, and opportunities for women. They reveal a concern with the development of "the New Zealander", a New Zealand literature and culture, and evidence a developing sense of national identity.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1641</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Bayesian analysis of financial time series</field><field name="creator">Berg, Andreas, 1972-</field><field name="description">In the last decades new ideas in the analysis of time series which are based on the assumption that trading is performed continuously in time have been developed. This idea has its strength in its flexibility and can overcome many theoretical and practical dlfficulties experienced with discrete time analysis. Due to Itos Lemma continuous time models are mathematically tractable, however in practice, statistical analysis is generally difficult since observations are available only at discrete times. Modelling continuous time models using stochastic differential equations including Brownian motions is a natural approach owing to the diffusion type motions of the models involved. I will introduce the most widely used processes for analysing financial models based on continuous time series and review common discretization methods, as well as approximation and estimation techniques. I will then concentrate on stochastic volatility models, which can also be derived from continuous time models and are nowadays commonly applied to analyse stock market data to exchange rates. Additionally, stochastic volatility models offer an alternative to the Black-Scholes models as a basis for pricing options. Latest advances in estimation methods for this demanding model will be reviewed. I will focus on several ideas on performing a Bayesian analysis for parameter estimation, once of them is based on automatic differentiation and the extended Kalman filter. This technique is compared with other Bayesian estimation procedures in terms of efficiency with simulated and real data sets. The need for reliable model checking criteria within the class of stochastic volatility models is revealed to be a complicated issue. Many of the classical or Bayesian standard approaches can not be adapted to this task. Therefore, a new idea on how to perform Bayesian model checking is taken up and further developed for the needs of comparing stochastic volatility models. The resulting deviance information criterion is compared with the more popular but far more computationally demanding Bayes factors and the easy to derive, but less accurate harmonic means. Furthermore I will give an overview of interest spot-rate models, which have their origin in continuous time. After introducing the latest literature on interest rate specific models, a new estimation technique based on latent observations for discretely observed diffusions using Bayesian methods is reviewed and a prior sensitivity analysis has been performed to assess estimation bias in the Vasicek model. Several case studies and simulations are carried out and results are reported at the end of each chapter.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1710</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fluorescence lifetime measurements using a synchronously pumped dye laser</field><field name="creator">Davis, Lloyd Mervyn</field><field name="description">Experimental techniques for measuring fluorescence lifetimes were evaluated for the purpose of studying the fluorescence quenching of the biologically important dye ethidium. A synchronously pumped cavity dumped dye laser was used to produce stable high repetition rate picosecond pulses for sample excitation. A system was established for recording nanosecond decay profiles by time correlated single photon counting. A careful investigation of the factors which contribute to the instrumental time jitter enabled an overall impulse response of 600 ps to be achieved. Software was developed for analysing fluorescence decay profiles by the method of convolution and curve fitting and its capability for accurately resolving multiple exponential components was evaluated using simulated data. Some improvement in accuracy was obtained by modifying the Poisson weights used in the curve fitting routine to allow for non-statistical errors, caused primarily by the wavelength dependence of the time response of the single photon counting photomultiplier. Fluorescence polarization effects are discussed. The rotational lifetime of Rhodamine 6G in ethylene glycol was determined by measuring the fluorescence polarization anisotropy decay and the Debye-Stokes-Einstein theory reaffirmed for small molecules at moderate viscosities. The torsional rigidity of DNA can be determined by measuring the depolarization of fluorescence of tightly bound (intercalated) ethidium, and this was not observed to change appreciably when the antitumour drug amsacrine also binds to the DNA. The fluorescence quenching of DNA intercalated ethidium by anticancer drugs was studied by accurately resolving the fluorescence decay profiles into exponential components. The lifetimes and proportions are interpreted in terms of current theories for drug binding and fluorescence quenching mechanisms. The fluorescence quenching behaviour by the antitumour drug amsacrine is consistent with a previously proposed electron transfer mechanism.</field><field name="date">1984</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::240000 Physical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1536</field></doc><doc><field name="title">"The English of this wildernesse:" Aspects of early New England&#8217;s literary inheritance, as illustrated by the works of Anne Bradstreet and Edward Taylor</field><field name="creator">Waller, Jennifer Robyn</field><field name="description">"'The English of this wildernesse': aspects of early New England's literary inheritance, as illustrated by the works of Anne Bradstreet and Edward Taylor." Since the late 1920's, the literature of early New England has been increasingly studied in the context of the development of American history, literature, and mythology. Without denying the usefulness of such a context, I want to redress the balance by setting selected aspects of two writers in particular, Anne Bradstreet and Edward Taylor, in the context of their English origins, and to study them specifically as English provincial writers who exemplify the important phenomenon of cultural lag in a community distant from but crucially attached to a changing metropolitan culture. Part of the originality of my approach is the new look I give to the implications of colonial and provincial literature. Chapter one outlines a detailed historical and critical context for my study. As well, I discuss some of the roots and presuppositions of modern literary scholarship of Early New England, and using T. S. Eliot's distinction between "aesthetic" and "merely historical" criticism, I stress the need for an evaluative context for the early New England poets to complement any discussion of historical perspective. In my second chapter, I tackle crucial and inadequately examined aspects of the influence of Puritanism on New England poetry, concentrating especially on the theological distrust of the imagination and (especially important for Taylor) the literary implications of eucharistic theology. Having developed the major strands of my approach, I then turn to Bradstreet (chapters three to six) and Taylor (chapters seven to nine). Chapter three discusses Anne Bradstreet in the context of Renaissance attitudes to women, in order to show what expectations and possibilities existed for a woman in her position to write poetry. Chapters four and five gradually move from an historical to an evaluative perspective - chapter four to deal with her public poetry, chapter five with her domestic verse and chapter six, her religious poetry. Chapters seven to nine are devoted to selected aspects of Taylor's work. Chapter seven attempts to make a new evaluation of his contribution to the Metaphysical literary tradition; chapter eight explores the implications of his religious beliefs for his poetic practices and especially his constant sense of literary inadequacy. In chapter nine, the crucial question of the relative importance of "historical" and "critical" contexts is again faced as I look at Taylor's poems on the Canticles, not in order to examine his sources, but rather to show the ways in which his poetical imagination responded to and transformed his sources. There is a brief concluding chapter. Throughout the study, I have responded to the great amount of critical and scholarly work done in recent years, and I have therefore concentrated on particular aspects of the topic which, if in no case providing me with totally untouched territory to map, at least have offered the chance of meaningful and original exploration. I also hope that I am offering my explorations within an original and provoking cultural and critical context.</field><field name="date">1974</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420200 Literature Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1571</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Treaty of Waitangi: a study of its making, interpretation and role in New Zealand history</field><field name="creator">Orange, Claudia</field><field name="description">From 1840 to the present, the Treaty of Waitangi has been a subject of some significance in New Zealand &#8211; a distinctive but subtle thread running through the fabric of the country&#8217;s history and shaping attitudes to race relations.

Though it resembles a true limpet externally, it is active when emersed during the ebbing of the tide browsing on small succulent algae, rather than grazing the surface film. The structure and function of the digestive and respiratory systems of Siphonaria were studied, particularly in relation to its adaptations to the intertidal mode of life. The digestive system is relatively simple consisting of a large buccal mass with paired salivary glands, a spacious esophageal crop, a slightly muscular stomach with two digestive diverticula and a simple intestine-rectum. The arrangement of the 28 muscles of the buccal mass and the odontophore is typical of patelliform pulmonates. The radula is a broad sheet with 144 &#177; 31 rows of teeth, each row having a tooth formula of (18&#177;4) + (18&#177;3) + (1) + (18&#177;3) + (18&#177;4). The radular teeth are continuously produced at a rate of 4.9 rows per day similar to those of active feeding herbivorous gastropods. The characteristics of the teeth and the movement of the mouth and the feeding traces showed that the feeding processes do not involve rasping of a hard substratum but browsing and scooping of soft lush algal growth. The whole alimentary tract is lined by ciliated columnar cells of a basic form but with slight structural variations in different region. Those in the oesophagus and stomach contain apical vesicles and lysosome-like bodies indicating involvement in intracellular digestion, while those in the intestine contain various amounts of lipid and glycogen, functioning in active absorption and storage. The ciliated cells of the post-intestine, having a much folded basal plasma membrane are apparently involved in osmoregulation. The proteinaceous secretory cells in the crop and mid-intestine and the glycoprotein cells in the pro-intestine are either producing enzymes for extracellular digestion or secreting the faecal-binding sheath. Mucous cells interspersed among the ciliated cells of the oesophagus intestine and rectum produce mucoid material for lubrication and transport of food particles. The cuticular strip in the anterior chamber of the stomach, probably a vestigial gastric shield consists of tall non-ciliated cells with thick microvilli embedded in a dense fibrous matrix. The salivary gland contains six cell types: grain cells, duct mucocytes, mucocytes I and mucocytes II, duct ciliated cells and undifferentiated cells. The first four are secretory, the grain cell being serous secretory and the other three muciparous, with varying amounts of mucopolysaccharides. The tubules of the digestive gland are made up of five cell types, acinous digestive cells, neck digestive cells, crypt cells, vacuolated cells and undifferentiated cells. Both types of digestive cells participate in absorption and digestion. The high lipofuscin content in the neck digestive cell suggests its possible role in lipid digestion. The crypt cell with elaborate GER whorls and proteinaceous globules is apparently secretory, producing enzymes for extracellular digestion. Apocrinal secretion of the globules from the crypt cells was observed for the first time. The vacuolated cells appear to be degenerated crypt cells with an excretory function. The digestive gland tubule was found to undergo cyclic changes, correlated with the feeding activity which is related with the tides. Enzyme assays showed the presence of various carbohydrases, proteolytic and lipolytic enzymes in the different region of the digestive system. The digestive gland is the main site of enzyme production. The pH optima of amylase, laminarinase and sucrase from various regions of the digestive tract were found to be within the pH range of the alimentary tract. The activities of various enzymes in the salivary gland and the oesophagus but not digestive gland were synchronous and correlated with feeding. When emersed, Siphonaria respires atmospherically with the pneumostome wide open, and the mantle cavity functioning as a lung without any active ventilatory movements. When submerged, the mantle cavity is filled with water, a strong water current through the gill being created by the ciliated dorsal and ventral raphe behind the gill. The available respiratory surfaces include the sides of the foot, the anterior mantle roof and the single plicate gill. All these are lined by a thin epidermis with large blood spaces beneath it the non-ciliated epidermal cells in different regions carry different lengths of microvilli, apparently related to the degree of their protective role. The respiratory physiology of Siphonaria was also studied. No tidal or diurnal rhythm in oxygen consumption was revealed. In unagitated conditions the aerial respiratory rate was much higher than the aquatic rate but with agitation, the aquatic rate increased to near the aerial rate. Cutaneous respiration constituted about 25% of the total. The respiratory rate varied with body weight, the coefficient b being temperature-independent (0.791 &#177; 0.122). Both aerial and aquatic respiratory rates increased with temperature. The highest temperature-sensitive range was 10-25&#176;C in winter and 15-30&#176;C in summer which coincided with the normal environmental temperature. No seasonal temperature acclimation was found within the normal thermal range. Respiratory pigments haemocyanin and myoglobin were detected in the blood and buccal mass respectively. Their characteristics were studied and their role in oxygen transfer system was postulated. The reverse Bohr shift of the haemocyanin may facilitate oxygen uptake in the lung during burses of activity at low tide. A high oxygen-combining capacity of the buccal mass myoglobin (21.2 vol%) indicated a role of oxygen storage during bursts of feeding activity. The distribution of carbonic anhydrase in various tissues was consistent with a transfer system facilitating the release of metabolic CO2 from the buccal mass. Finally the phylogenetic relationships of Siphonariidae with other groups of marine pulmonates were discussed. The unspecialised digestive system, the advanced form of nervous system and the possession of a secondary gill suggest that Siphonariidae, as a family, may not be an advanced derivative of any of the more primitive living basommatophoran groups, but could represent, along with the Gadiniidae, a specialized group which has originated directly from a primitive pulmonate stock and are adapted to life on exposed rock shores.</field><field name="date">1980</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270700 Ecology and Evolution::270702 Marine and estuarine ecology (incl. marine ichthyology)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1601</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Rural population growth and institutional response: Thames-Coromandel district</field><field name="creator">Bedogni, James Andrew</field><field name="description">Rural population growth has emerged in the 1970s as an important trend in many developed countries, including New Zealand. Increasing emphasis is also currently being accorded to the consideration of institutions and institutional factors in geographical research. This thesis develops the themes of population growth and institutions in rural areas and isolates institutional response as a relevant component in the overall growth process. Analysis of rural population growth in the study area of Thames-Coromandel provides the background context to the investigation of response by health, education and statutory planning institutions. The analysis itself reveals the dominance of inward migration in the growth process, the nucleated nature of much of the growth and major explanations relating to retirement and recreation development together with agricultural intensification and alternative lifestyle and craft industry development. Institutional response by the Hamilton Education Board and Thames Hospital Board is shown to be embedded in a complex web of constraints and determinants. However a definite expansion of services and facilities is clearly evident in the context of the demonstrated growth. Conversely the statutory planning response by the Thames-Coromandel District Council has tended to display a general lack of adequacy to date in the proper management of growth and development in the study area. Overall, the study provides both theoretical and practical insights into population growth and institutional response in rural areas and presents a basis for further research in this contemporary field of geographical study.</field><field name="date">1983</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370400 Human Geography</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1609</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The governal of health</field><field name="creator">Kiernander, Adrian Rodney Dixie</field><field name="description">The Governal of Health is a text of historical and linguistic interest, having been printed by William Caxton about 1489, thus being the earliest medical work printed in English. No other detailed study of the text has been made, and it has not been used in the compilation of the Oxford English Dictionary or Kurath and K&#252;hn's Middle English Dictionary. The principal objective of this edition has been to establish a clear and accurate text based on a detailed study of the eight located manuscript versions of the treatise, with constant reference to the Regimen Sanitatis of which it is a translation. One good manuscript version (from B.M. Add. MS. 29301) was selected as a base and freely emended from the other versions wherever it was clear that errors or omissions had been made. The introduction to the text contains descriptions of the eight manuscripts which have been located containing texts of The Governal of Health, together with notes on manuscripts containing versions of the Regimen Sanitatis, and on the surviving copies of Caxton's edition and other printed editions and facsimiles. (A discussion of the state of Caxton's text is found at the beginning of Appendix A). A study of the language of the text is included, concentrating particularly on the vocabulary, with an account of those words which are used with meanings not recorded in the Oxford English Dictionary or the Middle English Dictionary and those words which predate the first examples quoted in those dictionaries. Finally in the Introduction there are notes on the authorship and date of the text. The precise date of the text remains uncertain; however it is established as a result of this study that the treatise, previously ascribed variously to John de Bordeaux and Bartholomeus, was written by John Mirfeld at St Bartholomew's Priory. Transcriptions of Caxton's edition and of the Regimen Sanitatis (from BM. MS.

One hundred and three taxa are now known as fossil, and these are systematically described and illustrated. A number of major systematic revisions are proposed, including 1 new superfamily, 6 new subfamilies, 7 new genera, 2 new subgenera and 52 new species or subspecies. The material studied has revealed inconsistencies in the presently held views on phylogeny. Amongst the Balanomorpha, the Balanidae are shown to have evolved from a new six-plated archaeobalanid (with a tripartite rostrum), rather than Hexelasma; and in the Lepadomorpha, Arcoscalpellum is revised, and a new genus, which gave rise to many modern arcoscalpellids, is proposed. The difficulties in assigning the more primitive representatives of families to generic level are discussed, and keys are introduced to facilitate identification. The study also identifies many taxa with restricted time ranges, illustrating the stratigraphic importance of cirripeds. Thoracican ecology is discussed, and it is shown that early taxa preferred the shallower upper shelf environment; but following an explosive evolutionary radiation during the Lower Cenozoic, a great diversity of habitats became occupied. Neogene species especially, can be of considerable importance in paleoecology, both as indicators of depth and temperature. Faunal relationships are discussed in the light of new advances in plate tectonics. An early association between Australia and New Zealand can be recognised, and this is followed in the Neogene by the development of a South American fauna with distinct Australasian influences. Laboratory techniques, including thin section analysis and scanning electron microscopy are discussed with relevance to their use in identification.

I look especially at some of the ways in which medieval animals are used to comment satirically on the frailties and foibles of the human animal, man. Birds and beasts configured as humans present particular problems of identity and alterity that lend themselves well to the composition of recreational verse, and the fact that they are both so similar to humans and so different is particularly conducive to their use as vehicles of parody and satire. Also considered here are some of the early works in which animals are studied both as themselves and in comparison with humans, especially the texts of such classic natural historians as Aristotle and Pliny. I also glance, if only briefly, at the second-century Physiologus, which incorporates the work of Pliny and his followers together with biblical texts and Christianized moralizations. This seminal work, in the form of its direct descendants the medieval bestiaries, is a major source for writers of animal narrative in the Middle Ages. My study is organized in two parts. Part One contains the material outlined above together with some discussion on different kinds of satire&#8212;in particular, the satire of incongruity, so important in the context of animal impersonation of humans. It also considers the use of birds in various comic-satiric genres, especially in recreational texts such as the clerk and knight d&#233;bats, liturgical parodies and, above all, the peculiarly English genre of bird debate. The vernacular literary tradition represented in the eight bird poems in this section&#8212;ranging from the thirteenth to the early sixteenth century, some dialogic, some not&#8212;virtually constitutes a minor genre in which even a major poet like Chaucer was happy to work. Part Two contains four chapters devoted to a close reading and textual analysis of a single poem, The Owl and the Nightingale, probably the earliest and certainly the best of all the Middle English two&#8212;party bird debates. (My title&#8212;Contentious Birds&#8211;is derived from the descriptive title of thirteenth century poems in this particular debate tradition: The Thrush and the Nightingale, for example, appears in MS Digby 86 under the heading, "Ci commence la cuntent parente le Mauuis &amp; la russinole&#8221;). A spirited dispute of nearly eighteen hundred lines, The Owl and the Nightingale dates from the late twelfth or thirteenth century, and is remarkable above all for its freshness and originality, and its sheer, delightful ease of writing. A final chapter looks at conclusions in the debates and other poems in this study; at the question of the disputants' usefulness to man, particularly in The Owl and the Nightingale, and at the fluctuating nature of the boundaries that separate human from animal. Principal concerns in my thesis are the nature and the variety of the literary relationships constructed in the Middle Ages around these dividing lines between humans and birds or beasts (in this case, birds), and the ways in which these precarious lines of demarcation can be put especially, to recreational literary use.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1640</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Britain and Europe: a study of attitudes in Britain towards Britain's post-war relationship with Western Europe 1942-45</field><field name="creator">Malone, Judith (nee Elphick)</field><field name="description">I was drawn to this topic of research by my interest in the European movement its evolution over the past thirty odd years and, in particular the British response to these developments. A great deal has been written in this field for the 1950s, 60s and 70s, but there is almost nothing on the war period itself. This seemed an important gap, for the war was the context within which the nations of Western Europe became open to the possibility of a radically new ordering of the economic and political life of the Continent. And it was in the context of the war that Britain rose to a position of unparalleled prestige vis-a-vis her European allies who looked to her to provide the leadership essential for such an ambitious undertaking. I have taken the period from 1942-3 when the tide of war turned against the Axis Powers and Allied victory was certain, to the end of 1945, when the period of flux was ending and the first outlines of the Cold War were already apparent. This thesis, then, is an attempt to contribute something to the first chapter of the ongoing Britain-and-Europe debate as it emerged from the Second World War - still a controversial issue today.</field><field name="date">1980</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::430000 History and Archaeology::430100 Historical Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1602</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Aqueous oxidation of atmospheric Sulphur Dioxide</field><field name="creator">Brimblecombe, Peter, 1949-</field><field name="description">The work has been divided and abstracted under three headings: (1) The Absorption of Sulphur Dioxide by Aqueous Solution. The rate of absorption of low concentrations of SO2 (~ 500 &#181;g.m-3) was examined, varying a number of parameters. The results were expressed as deposition velocities (Vg = flux/gas concentration). Vg did not vary with relative humidity. Deposition into acid solutions (pH &lt;3) was controlled by diffusion processes in the liquid film while under more alkaline conditions (pH &gt;4) the process was governed by the rate at which SO2 could diffuse to the interface through the gas boundary layer. Oxidizing agents (e.g. H2O2) were found to increase the rate of diffusion in the liquid boundary layer. Salts generally exerted a more complex effect on liquid phase diffusion. Vg for SO2 deposition into aqueous solution under calm conditions and at pH values expected in the atmosphere was calculated to be about 0.7 cm.s-1 from these experiments. Efflux of SO2 from solution was examined at low pH values under boundary conditions similar to the deposition work. At high S(IV) concentrations in solution (~10-3N) the half lives for SO2 desorption from solution were 600, 1020, 3300 s for pH values 2.0, 2.5, 3.0 respectively. The consequences of the experimental results are discussed with respect to the atmosphere at large and to scrubbing of flue gases. Poor absorption rates for SO2 at low pH values suggested that sea water with its high pH would be an excellent scrubbings agent and its buffering ability was investigated. Experiments showed 10-3M S(IV) could be absorbed with the pH dropping only as far as pH 5.5. (2) The Oxidation of Sulphur Dioxide in Aqueous Solution The rate of oxidation in 10-5M of SO2 solutions was examined. The results showed the reaction to be very sensitive to traces of metallic ions, which made it impossible to determine the uncatalysed rate. The half life for oxidation of S(IV) in (10-5M) in triply distilled water was 36, 8, 5 hours at pH 4.6, 5.2, and 6 respectively. The rate increased upon addition of traces (10-6M) of Fe(III) and Mn(II) ions (pH 4 &#8211; 5) while Cu(II) seemed to act as an inhibitor. In solutions of ammonium sulphate Fe(III) was found to be an excellent catalyst. The reaction appeared to have a variable order with respect to S(IV) being 1st order at pH &lt;4 and 2nd order at pH &gt;5. Results in potassium sulphate were similar, but the reactions somewhat slower. At pH &gt;5 the reaction was sensitive to the alkali used for neutralization, the oxidation rate being much greater if ammonium hydroxide was used rather than sodium hydroxide. Solutions of ammonium chloride and sodium bicarbonate showed a second order dependence on S(IV) concentration at high pH values. The Fe(III) catalysed oxidation was faster in 'Chloride' solutions than in 'sulphate' solutions at pH &lt;4. A radical mechanism previously proposed by a number of workers was found to give considerable insight into the complex experimental results. (3) The Dissolution of Iron from Ferric Oxide and Pulverized Fuel Ash The aqueous oxidation of SO2 requires the presence of a catalytic metal ion. The most abundant catalyst in the atmosphere would appear to be iron. However, it would have to be present in solution to be an effective homogeneous catalyst. The rates of dissolution of iron from Fe2O3 were investigated and found to be extremely slow even in the presence of H2SO4 or 'H2SO3'. The dissolution of iron from pulverised fuel ash (a possible atmospheric source of iron in polluted areas) is quite rapid even under only Moderately acid conditions (pH 3.5) where solutions 1.9 x 10-4 M in Fe(III) can be reached in a matter of 20 minutes. The high rate of dissolution is thought to arise from the fusing of iron oxides with other alkaline oxides in the furnace.</field><field name="date">1973</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1595</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Osmium complexes as models for CO reduction intermediates</field><field name="creator">Headford, Christine E. L.</field><field name="description">This thesis is concerned with the synthesis, and aspects of the chemistry, of carbon-donor complexes of osmium as organo-metallic models for CO reduction intermediates. In Chapter 1 some aspects of ligand reactivity of the carbon-donor ligands CO, CS, CSe, CTe and carbenes in transition metal complexes are reviewed. The reduction reactions of these ligands are emphasized. The preparation and structure of the osmium &#951;2-formaldehyde complex Os(&#951;2-CH2O)(CO)2(PPh3)2 is described in Chapter 2. This complex has proved to be a useful synthetic precursor for stable osmium formyl, hydroxymethyl, methoxymethyl and halomethyl (-CH2X, X = Cl, Br, I) complexes and some facets of the reactivity of these ligands have been investigated. A general synthetic route to neutral osmium formyl complexes Os(CHO)X(CO)2(PPh3)2(X = halide or alkyl) has been developed. The facile preparation of a stable example of an intermediate formed during decarbonylation of a simple aldehyde by a transition metal, the osmium monohapto-acetyl-hydrido complex Os(&#951;1-C[O]CH3)H(CO)2(PPh3)2, has been demonstrated. A preliminary study of the reactions of the osmium iodomethyl complex Os(CH2I)I(CO)2(PPh3)2 is reported in Chapter 3. The typical reaction of this species is nucleophilic substitution; in many respects reactivity is analogous to an electrophilic methylidene complex. Reaction with a variety of nucleophiles [e.g. OR-, H-, EH- (E = S, Se, Te), NH2R and PR3] has been investigated and the ligand reactivity of some of these derivatives studied. A synthetic route to &#951;2-CSeS and &#951;2-CSe2 complexes of osmium without the use of molecular CSeS or CSe2 has been developed and the isolation of the geometrical isomers of the &#951;2-CSeS complex Os(&#951;2-CSeS)(CO)(CNR)(PPh3)2 (arising from &#951;2-C,S or &#951;2-C,Se coordination) has been achieved. The synthesis of a stable osmium hydrido-selenocarbonyl complex, OsHCl(CO)(CSe) (PPh3)2, has allowed the direct observation of hydride transfer from metal to CSe ligand. These latter results are discussed in Chapter 4.</field><field name="date">1980</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1610</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Politics and public themes in New Zealand literature 1930-1950 with special attention to Mulgan, Sargeson, Mason, Fairburn, Curnow</field><field name="creator">Harley, Ruth Elizabeth</field><field name="description">In the thirties and forties politics and public themes bore in upon writers influencing what they wrote about, the forms they chose and their conception of their function in society. It is a period in which writers sought to make literature serve the larger political end and often artistic merit is a function of the success the writer had in accommodating in his work the demands of outside pressures. It is always difficult to detach a period of history from the longer continuum but there is, nevertheless, a case to be made for viewing the years from about 1930 to around 1950 as a relatively homogeneous unit in New Zealand's literary history, distinct in important respects from what came before and from what followed. The new generation of writers in England in the thirties, particularly Auden and the group around him influenced young New Zealand writers both technically and in the attitudes they adopted to the relationship between the artist and society. The prevailing left-wing ethos emphasised the political and public responsibilities of the writer. Retreat into private, esoteric, literary modes was seen as an abdication of these responsibilities. The major themes of this period in New Zealand writing were social realism and nationalism; the literary products of the pressures exerted by political and economic forces. For the young writers the political awareness and sense of social commitment generated by the depression, together with the crusade to inhabit the land imaginatively, provided a sense of literary direction. These writers and their contemporaries accepted responsibility in both these areas seeing themselves as crusaders for social justice and creators of the imaginative understanding necessary to achieve a sense of belonging to this country. Such an understanding would be reached not through seeing it as offspring of England, nor as a picturesque, innocent new society; but by exploring it honestly and creating the terms and vocabulary for describing it. This study documents the careers of John Mulgan, Frank Sargeson, R.A.K. Mason, A.R.D. Fairburn and Allen Curnow in the period, roughly, 1930 to 1950, and looks at the ways each responded to the public demands they perceived were placed upon them. In their different ways these writers went about the business of changing New Zealand society, broadening its understanding of itself, creating an atmosphere conducive to artistic and literary development. Despite the fact that the degree of success in accommodating these demands varies considerably from writer to writer, the literary output of the period as a whole generated the confidence and energy that were a prerequisite to the development of an indigenous literature. During this period there developed an acceptance, albeit highly critical, of New Zealand and a feeling that the tradition which had been established in the thirties and forties could be extended by succeeding generations of artists and writers.</field><field name="date">1980</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420200 Literature Studies::420201 New Zealand literature in English</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1633</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reproductive biology and pollination ecology of Feijoa Sellowiana</field><field name="creator">Stewart, Anne Margaret</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">1987</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270400 Botany</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1728</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Distribution patterns of fish during the planktonic period of their life history</field><field name="creator">Kingsford, Michael John, 1955-</field><field name="description">The static and dynamic distribution patterns of ichthyoplankton were investigated over a 4 year period (1981 - 1985) off the coast of Leigh, on the northeastern coast of New Zealand. Emphasis was given to horizontal and vertical distributions, and these were described on scales encompassing broad areas of the outer Hauraki Gulf and smaller areas of 1 - 100m. The ages of these small fish were also investigated by examining daily increments in the otoliths, and this allowed a more complete interpretation of distribution patterns. Sampling that was carried out at different distances from the mainland identified major differences in the distribution patterns of individual species. For example, pilchards were caught in high densities right across the continental shelf, whereas morid cod were restricted to the outer edge of the shelf. The most intensive investigations were carried out over the Summer months and these revealed large differences in the abundances of species. For instance, few bothids and triglids were captured in December, while large numbers were caught in January. The spawning activity of adults and broad scale differences between water masses were probably responsible for these distance and time related patterns. Large differences in the densities of ichthyoplankton were found at different localities within each area of the continental shelf (e.g. close to the mainland). Furthermore, detailed investigations of abundances at a single locality over a three day period showed large changes. These changing distribution patterns were related to the dynamics of localized hydrological features (e.g. tidally induced gyres). The presence of islands over the continental shelf also influenced the distribution of small fish. Some species were only found near land, regardless of the distance from the mainland. From ichthyoplankton hauls and direct observations made using SCUBA, it is argued that the behaviour of ichthyoplankton may have a strong influence on their distribution patterns. For example, tripterygiids and gobiesocids of a variety of ontogenetic forms were observed to aggregate and maintain their position in the shallow areas of rocky reefs. Large differences were found in the vertical distributions of fish and this was true in water columns from 1 - 40m in depth. Ichthyoplankters of a number of species had different depth distributions. Some species were consistently found near the surface (e.g. hemiramphids &amp; mugilids) or near the bottom (e.g. eleotrids). For species found throughout the water column during the day, it was suggested that biological and physical stratification (e.g. thermoclines) strongly influenced relative densities at each depth stratum. Some species (especially engraulids &amp; scombrids) migrated toward the surface at night. Migration patterns varied for each species and among times. The latter patterns were related to ambient light levels which changed with the phase of the moon. Small scale structure in the pelagic environment influenced the distribution of fish. Large numbers of fish were found around drift algae and when experimental algae were left to drift, small fish of several species (e.g. Monacanthids) were quickly attracted to it. A number of species were abundant in surface waters, but did not associate with drift algae (e.g. engraulids). For fish that were found around drift algae, the association may be important as a source of shelter and food. There was considerable seasonality in the occurrence of fish species around algae, and the abundance of total drift algae. Drift algae were most abundant over Spring and early Summer. The movements and accumulation of algae are discussed in relation to the potential influence it has on recruitment patterns of fish in nearshore environments. The distribution patterns of small fish were strongly influenced by the surface slicks of internal waves. Densities of small fish, drift algae, and zooplankton were higher in slicks than in rippled water adjacent to them. Slicks moved at 0.5 - 1.25 km per hour in the direction of shore. A consequence of aggregation in slicks, therefore, is that small fish may be transported onshore. It is suggested that the accumulation of zooplanktonic food in slicks may be important for the feeding of ichthyoplankters. Many of the fish found in surface waters, be it in open water or around drift algae, had adult fin-ray counts and were not considered to be larvae, according to current definitions. From information on the age and size of these fish it is suggested that the capacity of fish to settle at a variety of ages and sizes has probably been underestimated. Furthermore, the occurrence of physical processes such as slicks may influence the duration of the planktonic phase and subsequent settlement rates of fish into nearshore environments. The major findings were used to provide an overall picture of what happens during the planktonic phase of some species (Chrysophrys auratus, Parika scaber &amp; tripterygiids), and these case histories are discussed in relation to current hypotheses concerning the ecology of ichthyoplankton.</field><field name="date">1986</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270500 Zoology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1752</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of topoisomerase II in amsacrine resistance</field><field name="creator">Rattray, Sandra J.(Sandra Jean)</field><field name="description">Restricted Item. Print thesis available in the University of Auckland Library or available through Inter-Library Loan. 1. Antitumour agents from many different chemical classes including acridines, have been shown to induce topoisomerase II-associated DNA breaks both in cultured mammalian cells and in vitro in the presence of purified mammalian DNA topoisomerase II. However, mechanisms linking these protein-associated DNA breaks with drug cytotoxicity are poorly understood. Whether this type of DNA damage is responsible for drug cytotoxicty was investigated using a number of acridine derivatives belonging to the sane chemical class but with varying potency in vivo. The modulation of topoisomerase II-mediated DNA breaks in whole L1210 cells, isolated nuclei and nuclear extract systems correlated with drug-induced cytotoxicity, at least for the drugs belonging to the amsacrine lineage. In contrast, there was no direct relationship between the inhibition of topoisomerase II strand-passing activity and the cytotoxic action of topoisomerase II-specific anticancer drugs. It was concluded that drug-induced formation and stabilization of the topoisomerase II-DNA cleavable complex rather than inhibition of its formation or of strand-passing functions, is responsible for DNA strand breakage and cell death caused by antitumour acridines such as amsacrine. 2. Two tissue culture systems (CHO-AA8 cells or P815 cell cycle mutants) were used as models to study the involvement of topoisomerase II in the resistance of non-cycling cells to amsacrine. Plateau-phase CHO-AA8 cells with a GO/Gl DNA content are resistant, to amsacrine and contain fewer DNA breaks than log-phase cells after drug treatment. (Robbie et al., 1988). The observations of Robbie et al. (1988) were further investigated in this thesis. The phage P4 DNA unknotting activity in CHO-AA8 cell nuclear extracts decreased 2-fold when the cells entered plateau-phase, but there was no difference in the sensitivity of unknotting to amsacrine between log- and plateau-phase nuclear extracts. Furthermore, drug stimulation of protein-DNA complex formation was similar in whole cells, isolated nuclei and nuclear extracts from either log- or plateau-phase cells. However, stimulation of complex formation in cells, nuclei or nuclear extracts was approximately 4-fo1d lower in plateau-phase than in log-phase. These results suggested that drug-enzyme interaction was altered in plateau-phase and there was a good correlation between the proliferative state of cells, amsacrine sensitivity DNA breakage and topoisomerase II-DNA complex formation. The second system used to study the effect of amsacrine was the cold-sensitive (proliferating at 39.5&#176;C; reversibly arrested in Gl-phase at 33&#176;C) cell-cycle mutant 21-Fb of the murine mastocytoma cell line, P815- The sensitivity of arrested 21-FB cells to amsacrine decreased &#8211;less than two-fold in cell survival experiments when compared to proliferating cells. In contrast, DNA breakage and stimulation of protein-DNA complex formation in intact cells, lysed cells or isolated nuclei was reduced approximately 10-fold in amsacrine-treated arrested cells and DNA-topoisomerase II activity in arrested cells was only 5% of the activity in proliferating cells. Thus in contrast to the CHO-AA8 cell system, there was no correlation between cell survival and DNA damage or DNA topisomerase II activity in drug treated 21-Fb cells. The exact reasons for the differences in amsacrine sensitivity in growth arrested CHO and 21-Fb cells were not resolved. However, it was concluded that a complex relationship exists between amsacrine-induced DNA breakage, topoisomerase II-DNA complex formation, topoisomerase activity and drug cytotoxicity. Moreover, a very complex set of parameters can influence drug-induced topoisomerase II-mediated lesions and cytotoxicity in different cells or even a single type of cell under different growth conditions. 3. Extracts of K21 murine mastocytoma cells were found to contain a factor that, enhances formation of amsacrine-induced topoisomerase II-DNA complexes (PDC) when added to isolated K21 nuclei. The PDC enhancing activity was reduced in extracts from 2 or 6 h cycloheximide- or cordycepin-treated cells, implying that continuous protein synthesis is required to maintain the factor. Preliminary characterization showed that the factor was heat labile and proteinase-sensitive suggesting the factor was a labile protein which was distinct from the two known classes of topoisomerase. The protein factor was present in at least four other cell lines and was substantially reduced in cells induced into a G1 state by temperature arrest or serum deprivation, Human Jurkat cells selected for resistance to amsacrine and displaying cross-resistance to other topoisomerase II-targeted drugs also exhibited significantly reduced PDC enhancing activity. These results suggested a contributing role for the PDC enhancing factor in mediation of drug resistance. Fractionation of mouse mastocytoma cell cytoplasmic extracts by salt precipitation, DEAE-cellulose chromatography and SDS-PAGE resulted in a 3571-fold purification of the PDC enhancing activity. The PDC enhancing activity was shown to reside in a 70 kDa protein kinase with specificity for a casein kinase II substrate and sensitive to heparin and anti-casein kinase II antiserum. This appears to be the first direct evidence of a protein factor that modulates amsacrine induced topoisomerase II action possibly by phosphorylating topoisomerase II or proteins associated with topoisomerase II.</field><field name="date">1989</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::320300 Medical Biochemistry and Clinical Chemistry</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1892</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Traumatic brain injury rehabilitation outcomes across cultures</field><field name="creator">Faleafa, Monique</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology::380107 Health, clinical and counselling psychology</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321200 Public Health and Health Services::321207 Indigenous healt</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1890</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Operational forest harvest scheduling optimisation: a mathematical model and solution strategy</field><field name="creator">Mitchell, Stuart Anthony</field><field name="description">This thesis describes the Operational Harvest Scheduling (OHS) problem and develops an algorithm that solves instances of the problem. The solution to an OHS problem is an Operational Harvest Schedule (OHS). An OHS: &#178; assigns forest harvesting crews to locations within a forest in the short-term (4-8 weeks); &#178; instructs crews to harvest specific log-types and allocates these log-types to customers; &#178; maximises profitability while meeting customer demand. The OHS problem is modelled as a Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP). The formulation given in this thesis differs significantly from previous literature, especially with regard to the construction of the problem variables. With this novel formulation, the problem can be solved using techniques developed in previous work on aircraft crew scheduling optimisation (Ryan 1992). These techniques include constraint branching and column generation. The concept of relaxed integer solutions is introduced. A traditional integer solution to the OHS problem will require harvesting crews to move between harvesting locations at the end of a week. However, a relaxed integer solution allows crews to move at any time during a week. This concept allows my OHS model to more effectively model the practical problem. The OHS model is formulated for New Zealand and Australian commercial forestry operations,though the model could be applied to other intensively managed production forests. Three case studies are developed for two companies. These case studies show improvements in profitability over manual solution methods and a significant improvement in the ability to meet demand restrictions. The optimised solutions increased profit (revenue less harvesting and transportation costs) by between 3-7%, while  decreasing the total value of excess or shortfall logs by between 15-86%.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Optimization</field><field name="subject">Forestry</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::230000 Mathematical Sciences</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1761</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Factors affecting the structure and dynamics of subtidal communities characterised by sponges</field><field name="creator">Battershill, Christopher</field><field name="description">Two subtidal reef communities characterised by sponges were examined to assess two distinct aspects of marine benthic community ecology which have not previously received much attention. The first study focused on the role of settlement events in the origin and maintenance of community structure and involved investigation of factors affecting dispersion, settlement and recruitment of sponge propagules. The second examined how natural gradients in ambient physical conditions, in the absence of disturbance, affected size structure and species interactions within the community. Settlement events were examined on a reef flat which was covered by a shallow sediment overlayer. The distribution and abundance of established sponges was found to be highly correlated with sediment regimes. The sponge community was shown to be stable over time and able to resist disturbance by storms because of the presence of turfing algae. Sponge settlement was inhibited by the sediment overlayer. Established sponges were found clumped into oblong groups orientated east-west and there were many instances where sponges were found closely associated. Adjacent areas were characterised by deeper unstable sediments and fewer sponges. Storms contoured sediments into ripples and scoured oblong east-west orientated patches of basal rock. Sediments were also sorted during storms such that particles of large grain size were left around the edges of ripples and over the scoured rock patches. The basal reef of both the stable and unstable areas was covered in a mosaic of encrusting algal and sponge species which tolerated the sediment overlayer. This assemblage was also exposed during storms. Sponges reproduced in a number of ways, but asexual propagules were the most successful. Sponges from several orders produced buds which developed in a complex manner. Buds adhered to rock and shell fragments of large size which acted as anchors, or attached to other buds irrespective of genotype. The change in weight and shape increased the likelihood that buds would gravitate into the scoured patches of basal rock. Bud loss off the reef was minimal. Buds were able to settle onto the basal rock patches and did so almost exclusively onto bare rock. A high degree of 'selectivity' of settlement site by buds was imparted by altering developmental rate during the settlement process in response to the substrate type. Polymastia granulosa buds exhibited an additional developmental sequence not previously reported for any colonial organism. Buds either settled directly in suitable conditions, or developed further along a different pathway. Buds which did not come into contact with basal rock elongated and appeared to be capable of digging into sediments. The elongated bud then broke up along its length into smaller particles, termed 'beads', which were capable of movement and invariably settled onto gravel fragments. Sponges were shown to settle onto scoured rock patches during storms and were eventually covered by sediments. Subsequent survivorship and recruitment depended species specifically on sediment depth and quality. Settlement patterns matched the observed dispersion patterns of established sponges and suggested a mechanism whereby the community had originated and how structure was maintained. These hypotheses were tested experimentally in situ and in the laboratory. The importance of asexual modes of reproduction, and settlement mediated by physical disturbance appears to be a common formula for recruitment by colonial marine organisms. Recruitment events were found to explain the distributional patterns of the established population. The structure of populations of thin encrusting species on vertical reef walls was examined in a novel manner whereby the mean size and density of individuals was quantified and related to gradients in the ambient physical environment. This was achieved by examining the benthic communities on a range of subtidal reef walls of uniform slope and aspect, but which were subject to natural gradients in physical conditions. The species composition of each of the six reefs studied was similar but the size structure of communties changed within each reef system in response to gradients in light intensity and water movement. Fish and urchin disturbance was shown to be unimportant and there was no indication that storms disrupted communities. The implications of changes in size structure of populations on interactions between component species in different ambient conditions were examined. The eastern wall of two cave, archway and open reef systems was surveyed according to a stratified sampling design where each reef was divided by depth and distance along the wall. Different taxonomic/morphological groups were found at particular positions on reef walls. Thin encrusting algal species were found to be one of the most abundant groups. It was assumed that the individual size of encrusting species at each wall position reflected long term ambient environmental conditions as well as the ability of each species to maintain itself against overgrowth by neighbours. By relating the population size structure of different taxa with indices for light intensity and water movement recorded at each wall position within each reef, it was shown that community structure varied markedly on the same reef wall as a function of ambient physical conditions. Changes in proportional species composition, notably from thin encrusting algal dominated assemblages to sponge characterised assemblages, with decreasing light intensity were accompanied by changes in the individual size structure of populations. At each wall position all species exhibited similar individual size. Individual size decreased and density of individuals of all species increased with decreasing light intensity. In conditions where light levels were not sufficient to support algae, individual size of encrusting fauna increased with increasing water movement. The implications of these observations on competitive interactions between encrusting species was examined. The outcome of competitive interactions between the same species was found to vary depending on wall position.</field><field name="date">1987</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270700 Ecology and Evolution::270702 Marine and estuarine ecology (incl. marine ichthyology)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1740</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies on chemically modified cytochromes Cl2</field><field name="creator">Mathews, Antony James</field><field name="description">Tuna and Horse cytochromes c were purified and chemically modified with the water soluble carboxyl group modifying reagent 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide (EDC), using the method of Timkovich (1980). The time-course of modification was followed by visible spectroscopy and by functional measurements. Both methods indicated that disruption of the haem crevice regions of the proteins was largely complete within 10-15 minutes exposure to EDC. The EDC modified Tuna and Horse proteins (THC* and HHc* respectively) showed essentially identical functional properties to those described by Timko-vich (1980) for THc*. These include a typical methionine coordination to the haem iron, as shown by the absence of the 697nm visible absorption band from the spectra of the oxidized derivatives, and a pH dependent high spin - low spin transition for the derivatives in this oxidation state. In the reduced forms, THc* and HHc* show reactivity with carbon monoxide and oxygen indicating the haem crevice regions of these proteins is disrupted compared to those of the native proteins. The tryptic peptides of native Tuna and Horse cytochromes c were mapped by HPLC and identified by amino acid analysis. Examination of the tryptic digests of THc* and HHc* by gel filtration and HPLC revealed the presence of trypsin indigestible material indicating the presence of EDC promoted intramolecular cross-links within the modified proteins. Failure to extract the haem groups from THc* and HHc* after cleavage of the protein-haem thio-ether bonds, indicates cross-linking of the exposed haem propionate groups to the proteins. Labelling of the native and EDC modified proteins with glycine methyl ester showed that THc* and HHc* contain several covalently modified carboxyl groups. The results of Timkovich (1980) for THc* are discussed with respect to these findings. The reduction of THc*3+ and HHc*3+ by L-ascorbic acid and by the strong inorganic reducing agent sodium dithionite, was studied using stopped flow spectrophotometry. The kinetics of reduction of the modified proteins by these reagents could be accounted for by mechanisms similar to those proposed for the reduction of the native proteins by these reagents (Myer et al, 1980; Lambeth and Palmer, 1973). The effect on the reactions, of chemical modification of the proteins, is discussed. The reaction of the reduced derivatives with carbon monoxide was studied by stopped flow spectrophotometry, flash photolysis, and by equilibrium binding measurements. The reduced derivatives have a high affinity for carbon monoxide. Flash photolytic studies indicated very low quantum yields for photo-dissociation of the reduced protein CO complexes. The reduced derivatives formed complexes with oxygen which were unstable, decaying to form the oxidized protein. The rate of conversion to the oxidized protein was dependent on the solution pH. It was found that in the presence of excess reducing agent, THc*2+ and HHc*2+ could catalytically reduce oxygen. Steady state kinetic measurements were carried out to determine the dependence of the rate of oxygen reduction on various parameters. Similarities to the reactions of reduced carboxymethylated cytochrome c with oxygen are discussed.</field><field name="date">1985</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270100 Biochemistry and Cell Biology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1744</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The mirror: a selection from Corpus Christi College, Cambridge MS.282</field><field name="creator">Morgan, Gregory E.</field><field name="description">Corpus Christi College, Cambridge Ms 282 dates from the late fourteenth century and contains one of the six copies of the Mirror. The Mirror is an English translation of the Miroir, a series of Anglo-Norman verse sermons for Sundays and other liturgical occasions. The Miroir was written by one Robert of Gretham, probably during the early part of the thirteenth century. Excerpts from the Miroir and the Mirror have been published; for the Anglo-Norman there are a book length study and an edition of eight sermons, and for the English there is an unpublished edition of the introduction and first twelve sermons (Hunterian MS). We need complete editions of the Anglo-Norman and English works; it is unlikely that a critical edition of the English Mirror would be base upon, or even draw heavily upon, the Corpus Christi MS, and I have thought it worthwhile to examine at least part of that MS because it is one of the texts which preserve an early London-type dialect. This edition presents a reader&#8217;s edition of eight sermons. Notes and a glossary accompany the text; the notes make limited use of one of the MSS of the Miroir. The introduction considers such matters of palaeography etc. as it is possible to discuss when one is working from a microfilm copy; it then covers language (aspects of phonology, morphology, syntax, and vocabulary) and cites some analogues to the Miroir/Mirror. The introduction and the bibliography survey what has been written about the English work and its Anglo-Norman original.</field><field name="date">1990</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420100 Language Studies::420101 English</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1776</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Conductive film model for the kinetics of the lead anode in aqueous sulphuric acid</field><field name="creator">Hall, Simon Berners</field><field name="description">The kinetics and mechanism of the anodic process on lead in aqueous 35% H2SO4 (4.65 mol L-1) were studied. The lead anode is of interest as it is used in the form of the sponge lead negative plate in the lead-acid battery. Discharge of both planar and porous lead electrodes result in the electrocrystallisation of PbSO4. In the past, the processes occurring at the lead electrode have been shown to include: dissolution, precipitation, and passivation. The techniques used were cyclic voltammetry, potential-step, and potential-ramp/potential-hold. The resultant transients were recorded both as analogue and digital waveforms. Investigations were carried out at a constant acid strength over a range of temperatures (-18&#176; to 30&#176;C), and in the presence of additives. Significant variation was found in cyclic voltammetry with regard to the cathodic potential prehistory immediately prior to measurements. After extreme cathodic polarisation (below -1500 mV us SHE), voltammograms were recorded with relatively high anodic peak currents and charges. The extra charge was associated with the growth of a multilayer, and dissolution from the bare electrode. This multilayer is not reduced on subsequent moderate cathodic excursions (above -1000 mV). Hence for cyclic voltammograms in the absence of extreme cathodic polarisation one observes relatively small currents and anodic charges. This is due to transmission of Pb2+ ions through the multilayer under resistance control. Passivation occurs in both cases by precipitation of microcrystalline PbSO4 on the multilayer. In contrast to cyclic voltammetry, potential-step transients were insensitive to cathodic polarisation and displayed current peaks due to growth of the surface film. One also observes a dissolution current from the bare electrode before it is covered by the growing film. The current first increases, passes through a maximum, and then decays with time. The increasing current was associated with growth of the multilayer, and the decaying current due to passivation by PbSO4. A new model was successfully applied to the potential-step and potential sweep results. The model consists of several charge-transfer reactions: growth of a multilayer, dissolution from the bare electrode, and transmission of Pb2+ through the multilayer. The kinetics of the multilayer are pivotal to the other charge-transfer reactions. The inclusion of film transmission is the novel aspect of this model. Quantitative analysis of the model resulted in a set of optimised parameters that follow plausible variation with anodic potential. Both the potential step and potential sweep transients are adequately described by the model. The effect of chloride added to the electrolyte was studied. The anodic and cathodic peaks in cyclic voltammetry are enhanced by this anion (100% more anodic charge at higher chloride concentrations) and the cathodic to anodic charge ratio is markedly increased. The general form of the potential-step transients are not modified by chloride. Evidence of a monolayer of PbCl2 was found (q = 500 &#181;C cm-2) in both cyclic voltammetry and potential step experiments. The monolayer of PbCl2 must underlie the subsequent growth of the multilayer as the monolayer is first formed in potential-step experiments and first to be reduced in cyclic voltammetry at a small underpotential. The effect of methyl orange on the lead anode was explored and found to enhance the charge capacity. Battery tests confirmed these observations, but methyl orange was destroyed by the oxidising PbO2 at the positive plate. Hence a derivative, designed to be insoluble in H2SO4, was synthesised. However, experiments on both planer and porous electrodes showed that the derivative, lauryl orange, C12H25NHC6H4NNH+C6H4SO3- (pKa = 4.06) was found to act as an inhibitor for the anodic reactions. In particular there was no contribution from multilayer growth in potential step experiments, and only dissolution (markedly diminished) and passivation were evident. Lauryl orange exhibited the required capabilities to bind to lead metal. The structure of lauryl orange was confirmed by n.m.r. and mass spectrometry.</field><field name="date">1988</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1780</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Photoperiodic control of development in the New Zealand leafroller moth Planotortrix octo Dugdale (Lepidoptera, Tortricidae)</field><field name="creator">Morris, Michael Charles</field><field name="description">The aim of this study is to test for photoperiodic control of larval and pupal development in the New Zealand moth Planotortrix octo Dugdale. The photoperiodic response curves for larval and pupal development and especially for instar number at 17&#176;C and 21&#176;C indicate that a photoperiodic mechanism is involved. Superimposed on this response is the suggestion that daylength affects development rate directly, with larvae and pupae developing faster under longer photophases. This effect is especially strong for pupal development (Chapter 3). The effects of thermophotoperiods (Chapter 4), night interruption and resonance experiments (Chapter 6) provide further evidence for photoperiodic involvement. The response to resonance experiments suggests the involvement of an hourglass rather than a circadian mechanism. Larvae reared under short days accumulate significantly more lipids in the 5th and 6th instars than larvae reared under long days (Chapter 4). This finding, combined with the suppressed development rate and higher instar number under short days, suggests that a weak form of diapause may be present in this insect. This is significant in being the first recorded incidence of a photoperiodically induced diapause in a phyllophagous New Zealand insect for which a year round food supply is available (Chapter 1). By transferring insects from long to short days I found that long days have more influence than short days on larval development (Chapter 7). An attempt was made to measure juvenile hormone titres under long and short days using a Galleria bioassay. The test used was not sensitive enough however to measure any significant amounts of juvenile hormone (Chapter 8). Simulations of the experimental results were performed using a damped circadian oscillator model (Chapter 9). This model was considered the most appropriate to use, based on the experimental results and on a review of the literature (Chapter 2). Simulations showed good similarities with experimental results in most cases, but could not account for resonance responses.</field><field name="date">1990</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270500 Zoology::270505 Entomology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1825</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A model minority?: Chinese youth and mental health services in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Hauraki, Jennifer</field><field name="description">The 'model minority' label given to Chinese populations in New Zealand and other Western countries have made it difficult to truly comprehend the difficulties faced by some Chinese ethnic minorities. Despite comparable rates and types of mental health problems to their European counterparts, identifiable barriers have led to Chinese ethnic minorities underutilising mental health services. The present study investigated the mental health service utilisation in native- and foreign-born Chinese youth in New Zealand, paying particular attention to barriers to service utilisation and viable solutions for these difficulties. It consisted of three individual projects and explored the views of Chinese community and mental health professionals and Chinese university students, comparing their perspectives to university students of other ethnicities. Findings showed that despite a willingness to seek help from their family and mental health professionals (e.g., psychologists, school counsellors), respondents identified a myriad of obstacles to the help seeking of Chinese youth. These included physical barriers (e.g., financial and transport constraints), personal barriers (e.g., stigma, problems accepting their difficulties), service barriers (e.g., paucity of knowledge regarding mental health problems and available services) and family barriers (e.g., obstruction from family members). Family and service barriers distinguished the difficulties faced by Chinese in comparison to European youth, particularly with regards to the adherence of professionals to stereotypes of Chinese youth, a unique finding of this study. In order to reduce such barriers, the Chinese university students and professionals advocated for greater education regarding mental health problems and services in the Chinese community, education for Chinese parents regarding adolescent issues, an increase in the number of practicing Chinese professionals that is coupled with improved cross-cultural training for non-Chinese professionals, as well as individual assessment and treatment approaches with Chinese youth and their families.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology::380107 Health, clinical and counselling psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1876</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Computer aided modelling of sheet metal forming</field><field name="creator">Templer, Richard Geoffrey</field><field name="description">The work described by this thesis presents several new methods of the computer modelling of sheet metal forming. In particular it focuses on the design steps of sheet metal forming; blank shape prediction, part design, die design and part applications. This work concentrates on developable surfaces, which are the tangent surfaces of space curves and include cones and cylinders. Developable surfaces are so called, because they can be rolled out (developed) onto a plane without stretching, tearing or creasing. A folded developable is formed when a developable surface is folded about a curve. Since folded developables are formed only by folding they are ideally suited to being constructed from sheet metal. New theories are presented that accurately predict the surface that will be formed if a general developable surface is folded about a general curve. The theories have been developed into a computer program, 3FD, that allows the rapid and accurate design of folded developables. Several different folded developables have been designed using the program and compared with physical results, with excellent geometric correlation. An improved method of computer aided blank shape prediction has been developed. The method can be applied to both folded developables and to general sheet metal components. The method uses new boundary conditions to increase the accuracy of the predicted blank shape. The method also indicates possible areas of forming problems. A pressed automobile component is used to illustrate the increased accuracy of the new method. The design program can also generate the geometry necessary to create the die set to form a folded developable. Such a die set has been created and a folded developable formed from it. The formed folded developable closely matches the computational model. The design program has also been used to investigate the kinematics of folded developables. The mechanism of a simple folded developable has been determined and the implications and possible applications of this are discussed.</field><field name="date">1994</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1900</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Interspecific hybridization in Fuchsia</field><field name="creator">Talluri, Rama Srinivas</field><field name="description">Fuchsia is a large and distinctive genus in the family Onagraceae comprising over 110 species, classified into 12 sections. The tropical Andes, Mexico-Central America, Hispaniola, southeastern Brazil, southern Andes and South Pacific region (New Zealand and Tahiti) are the biodiversity hotspots for this genus. It is also an important floricultural genus of trees and shrubs. Fuchsia procumbens, a New Zealand endemic species is unique with upright yellow flowers, unusual blue pollen and procumbent plant growth characters, characters that are absent from existing cultivars. One goal of this research was to investigate whether these characters could be transferred between species by artificial hybridization. An extensive hybridization programme both between the American species and between them and the New Zealand one resulted in the production of many new hybrids. The morphological features and parentage of these new hybrids were documented in this study. A significant first has been the production of a yellow flowered hybrid from a cross between F. encliandra and F. procumbens. It combines the plant growth character of F. encliandra and the flower colour and form of F. procumbens. The procumbent plant growth character has also been transferred in a cross with F. splendens but this hybrid has yet to flower. Many other interesting hybrids have also been produced with interesting variation in both floral and vegetative characters. Not all cross combinations were successful and a variety of pre- and post-fertilization barriers to hybridization were observed, some of which were investigated in more detail. Once hybrids were produced in the crosses between American species most of the plants were vigorous, unlike most of hybrids produced between New Zealand and American species. An exception amongst the crosses between American species produced sub-viable plants that showed a virus-like syndrome.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2008</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Asymmetric synthesis of novel anthracyclinones</field><field name="creator">Rustenhoven, Job Jesse</field><field name="description">The synthesis of novel C9-halogenated anthracyclinones by Lewis acid promoted cyclisations of ortho-methallyl anthraquinonyl chiral dioxanes has been investigated. Tin tetrachloride-N,N-dimethylformamide promoted cyclisation of the dioxane (30) proceeded with excellent stereoselectivity to give an 82% yield of the diastereomerically pure chlorotetracycle (78). Stronger Lewis acids gave poorer selectivity and boron trifluoride etherate reacted slowly with (30) but with high selectivity to give the diastereomerically pure fluorotetracycle (91) in 58% yield. The presence of a &#946;-methoxy group in the substrate leads to decreased stereoselectivity due to competition between chelation and non-chelation controlled pathways. Stereochemistry was assigned to the products using a combination of X-ray crystallography, conformational analysis, nuclear Overhauser enhancements and chemical degradation. Attempts were made to extend the highly selective acetal cyclisation methodology to the intramolecular reaction of the allylsilane (121), cyclisation of which was expected to provide enantioselective access to the alkene (146). The synthesis of (121) was achieved despite its instability, but attempted cyclisations with Lewis acids or fluoride ions were unsuccessful. The racemic alkene (146) was prepared by an ene cyclisation and subjected to asymmetric dihydroxylation (AD). The products from the AD reactions are of considerable biological interest and have been characterized. Their stereochemistry has been assigned by 1H nmr comparisons with the parent diphenols, which have resulted in revisions of assignments made by earlier workers.</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1903</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Isolation and characterisation of two amylin responsive proteins from rat skeletal muscle</field><field name="creator">Lee, Shao Chin</field><field name="description">Two amylin responsive proteins, here designated ARP1 and ARP2, were discovered from rat skeletal muscle through two dimensional gel electrophoresis analysis. ARP1 was detected only in amylin-stimulated muscles where the insulin-stimulated glucose incorporation into glycogen was inhibited. This protein incorporated 32Pi but not [35S]-methionine in the metabolic labeling experiments. Subsequent molecular characterisation revealed that ARP1 was a novel monomeric form (designated form 1) of protein p20, and two other monomeric forms (designated forms 2 and 3 respectively) of protein p20 were also characterised. The production of ARP1 was not affected by the presence of insulin, but calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) was found to evoke the production of ARP1 in the presence or absence of insulin. In contrast, ARP2 was detected in both control and amylin-stimulated muscles. Amylin stimulation evoked incorporation of [35S]-methionine but not 32Pi into the protein and increased its concentration significantly. It is concluded that amylin elicits the production of ARP1 through phosphorylation and increases the protein biosynthesis of ARP2; the amylin-evoked production of ARP1 is insulin independent; amylin and CGRP share, at least in part, an intracellular signal transduction pathway; and ARP1 and 2 may be involved in the development of insulin resistance. It is suggested that ARP1 and 2 could potentially be used as molecular markers for the analysis of amylin action.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1901</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Influence of reef-associated predators on adjacent soft-sediment communities</field><field name="creator">Langlois, Timothy John</field><field name="description">&#8216;Infaunal haloes&#8217; of either decreasing or increasing abundances of individual soft-sediment species with distance from reefs have been suggested to be caused by reef-associated predators. A large-scale mensurative experiment was used to investigate the distribution of two size classes of macrofauna with distance from the reef edge across three locations in northeastern New Zealand. The role of reef-associated predators, the snapper (Pagrus auratus Sparidae) and rock lobster (Jasus edwardsii Palinuridae), was investigated using established marine reserves at each location. Consistent patterns were found in a few large-bodied fauna. The hermit crab Pagurus novizelandiae occurred more frequently near the reef edge, whilst the heart urchin Echinocardium cordatum and bivalve Dosinia subrosea were more abundant further away from the reef. Dosinia subrosea and another bivalve, Myadora striata, exhibited lower biomass at sites with higher densities of snapper and rock lobster. In contrast, small-bodied macrofauna showed no consistent patterns with distance from the reef or among sites with different predator populations. It was hypothesised that predation was driving the distribution of large bivalves. An experiment was done to investigate this model using D. subrosea. Equal densities of this bivalve were established in plots either with or without cages at sites either inside or outside of reserves. Significant predation was detected, but only inside reserves. Much of this mortality could be specifically attributed to predation by large rock lobsters, given the distinctive marks on the valves of dead D. subrosea. Inside reserves, predators are not only more abundant but also larger. It was hypothesised that different size classes of predators would result in different levels of predation. Laboratory feeding experiments were used to investigate this model. Lobsters of all sizes chose D. subrosea over the heavier shelled D. anus. Small lobsters chose to prey on small D. subrosea and large lobsters more frequently chose larger prey. The distributions of these two bivalve species at protected (large predators) and fished sites (small predators) reflected the feeding choices observed in the laboratory. Results suggested that rock lobster populations are capable, where their size structure is not truncated by fishing pressure, of controlling population-level dynamics of bivalve communities adjacent to reefs.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270700 Ecology and Evolution::270702 Marine and estuarine ecology (incl. marine ichthyology)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1894</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Radiative transfer in multiply layered media</field><field name="creator">De Lautour, N. J. (Nathaniel J.)</field><field name="description">The theory of radiative transfer is applied to the problem of multiple wave scattering in a one-dimensional multilayer. A new mathematical model of a multilayer is presented in which both the refractive index and width of each layer are randomized. The layer widths are generated by a new probability distribution which allows for strong layer width disorder. An expression for the transport mean free path of the multilayer is derived based on its single-scattering properties. It will be shown that interference between the field reflected from adjacent layer interfaces remains significant even in the presence of strong layer width disorder. It will be proven that even when the scattering is weak, the field in a random multilayer localizes at certain frequencies. The effect of increasing layer width randomization on this form of localization is quantified.  The radiative transfer model of time-harmonic scattering in multilayers is extended to narrow-band pulse propagation in weakly scattering media. The tendency of pulses to broaden in this medium is discussed. A radiative transport model of the system is developed and compared to numerical solutions of the wave equation. It is observed that pulse broadening is not described by simple transfer theory. The radiative transfer model is extended by the addition of a Laplacian term in an attempt to model the effect of ensemble average pulse broadening. Numerical simulation results in support of this proposal are given, and applications for the theory suggested.  Finally, the problem of acoustic wave scattering by planar screens is considered. The study was motivated by the idea that multiple scattering experiments may prove possible in a medium composed of such scatterers. Successful multiple scattering in a medium of planar scatterers will depend on the scattering cross-section at angles away from normal incidence. The scattering cross-section is calculated for a circular disc using a new technique for solving the acoustic wave equation on planar surfaces. The method is validated by comparison with available analytic solutions and the geometric theory of diffraction.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">radiative transfer</field><field name="subject">one-dimensional multilayer</field><field name="subject">localization</field><field name="subject">plane screen diffraction</field><field name="subject">wavelets</field><field name="subject">transport mean free path</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::240000 Physical Sciences::240200 Theoretical and Condensed Matter Physics::240201 Theoretical physics</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::240000 Physical Sciences::240500 Classical Physics::240501 Acoustics and acoustical devices; waves</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1904</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Failure of sandwich honeycomb panels in bending</field><field name="creator">Staal, Remmelt Andrew</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates failure in sandwich panels due to bending, specifically localised buckling or wrinkling, a predominant failure mechanism for thin gauge honeycomb sandwich panels loaded in bending or compression. Over the past 60 years, considerable work has been devoted to understanding wrinkling and trying to predict failure loads in damaged and undamaged panels accurately. Existing wrinkling expressions were shown to over-estimate failure loads by over 100%. Discrepancies between wrinkling expressions and experimental failure loads were previously attributed to imperfections and irregularities in the structure. The aim of this thesis is to investigate this problem and try to accurately predict failure loads and understand the underlying failure mechanisms in damaged and undamaged panels, using a combination of numerical and analytical techniques. Classical wrinkling models use a continuum core to model complex cellular honeycomb cores. This type of model reduces complex cellular geometry to a series of effective properties that provide constant support to the face sheet. In reality, honeycomb cores provide support around the periphery of the cell walls and not across the entire surface of the face sheet. Due to the nature of wrinkling and the size of the wavelength, incorrect representation of the core could affect the failure loads and model. This study made direct comparisons between linear buckling loads of a discrete-cored sandwich panel and a continuum-cored sandwich panel. Discrete properties were converted to continuum properties within a Finite Element package. The result conclusively showed that both models predict the same linear failure loads, disproving the theory that the core representations contribute to the difference between experimental and analytical models. It was also shown that existing wrinkling models can accurately predict linear wrinkling loads. These linear model loads do not necessarily match the collapse strength of the physical panel and in most cases predict a significantly higher value.  The research then moves on to developing expressions to convert cellular geometry into continuum properties accurately. Expressions are developed for honeycomb structures with fillets in their junctions. Both out-of-plane and in-plane modulus properties are reviewed and the models are verified against Finite Elements models and experimental results. Studies showed that the restrained in-plane modulus can be up to ten times stiffer than the commonly used free modulus value. This has a significant effect on the wrinkling stress. By using the correct value, the discrete model and continuum models predict the same loads. The classical wrinkling expressions also predict the same wrinkling stress as the Finite Element models. After establishing that the core representation is not the cause of the prediction error, the thesis turns to non-linear Finite Element models to predict failure loads and failure mechanism of thin-gauge sandwich honeycomb structures loaded in bending. A continuum three-dimensional non-linear Finite Element model, with bilinear plasticity, is compared with a set of experiments that use different types of Nomex cores and face sheets. The models show that the panels fail prematurely due to core crushing because of wrinkles forming in the face sheets. Experimental results indicate similar trends. The final section examines the affect of impact damage in honeycomb sandwich structures. Due to the thin face sheets and thick cores used on many aircraft and marine components, sandwich panels offer little resistance to impact events. Resulting damage usually consists of a layer of crushed core and a shallow dent in the face sheet. This type of damage often leads to a significant reduction in the load-carrying capacity of the panel through a full range of damage sizes. Finite element and analytical models were developed to accurately predict and capture the localised wrinkling failure mechanism which occurs in the impacted area. Models were directly compared to experimental results, with a high degree of correlation. The numerical and analytical models showed that impact damaged panels were failing due to wrinkling instability and not due to premature core crushing, which is the case with undamaged panels.

The aim of this thesis is to explore aspects of the pathogenesis and treatment of three conditions that may cause or contribute to osteoporosis: human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT), and vitamin D insufficiency. Each of these conditions is potentially linked to bone metabolism via associations with nutritional status, which in turn is a key regulator of bone mass and fracture risk. Methods: Eight studies were performed: 1. Cross-sectional comparison of bone mineral density (BMD) in HIV-infected men and age-matched controls. 2. Two-year randomised controlled trial of the effects of annual zoledronate on BMD in HIV-infected men. 3. Longitudinal comparison of the change in BMD over two years in HIV-infected men not receiving skeletal therapy and controls. 4. Meta-analysis of body weight in patients with PHPT. 5. Cross-sectional analysis of the relationship between parathyroid hormone and body weight in post-menopausal women. 6. Cross-sectional analysis of the determinants of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) in post-menopausal women and middle-aged and older men. 7. Cross-sectional analysis of the effects of fat mass and seasonal variation on diagnosis of vitamin D sufficiency. 8. Cross-sectional analysis of the relationship between vitamin D binding protein and body weight in older men and women. Results: 1. HIV-infected men were 6.3 kg lighter than controls, and after adjustment for this weight difference, did not have lower BMD than controls. 2. Annual intravenous zoledronate caused substantial increases in BMD in HIV-infected men over two years. 3. HIV-infected men did not have accelerated bone loss over time compared to controls. 4. Patients with PHPT are on average 3.1-3.3 kg heavier than age-matched controls. 5. Fat mass is an important determinant of parathyroid hormone levels. 6. The major determinants of 25OHD levels in men and women are surrogate measures of ultraviolet-B exposure, and fat mass, but men have higher 25OHD levels throughout the year than women. 7. Thresholds for diagnosis of vitamin D sufficiency vary by season and amount of fat mass. 8. Vitamin D binding protein does not mediate the relationships between 25OHD and age, gender or weight.  Conclusions: Uncomplicated HIV infection is not associated with low BMD at baseline or accelerated bone loss over time. There are important relationships between body weight and PHPT, and among fat mass, parathyroid hormone and 25OHD that have significance both for the pathogenesis of PHPT and vitamin D sufficiency, and for the clinical diagnosis and treatment of these conditions.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Osteoporosis</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2006</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Liberty, peace, and friendliness: the political ideas of Auberon Herbert</field><field name="creator">Edyvane, Valda</field><field name="description">The political ideas of Auberon Herbert are usually associated with the late Victorian Individualist thinkers primarily influenced by the philosopher Herbert Spencer. Although Herbert derived his political philosophy of Voluntaryism from Spencer&#8217;s thinking it also owed much to J. S. Mill. Voluntaryism was based on a Lockean-Spencerian conception of individual natural rights that asserted self-ownership and the moral obligation for individuals to respect the rights of other people. Rights protection against force and fraud constituted the primary purpose of government. Herbert, aptly describing Voluntaryism as the system of liberty, peace and friendliness, applied these principles to a range of situations from street maintenance, to collective property purchase, and, finally, to the voluntary support of the state. Voluntary taxation was the most controversial component of Herbert&#8217;s theory, emphasising its distinctiveness. Although Herbert resisted socialist and new liberal attempts to expand the role of the state, his reasons for doing so shared little in common with conservative critics of this direction. Herbert, a republican and democrat, repeatedly attacked privilege, seeking widespread change including land reform and universal suffrage. His position represented that of a radical reformer seeking to promote Voluntaryism as the basis for friendly co-operation among free individuals at home and abroad. An internationalist, Herbert opposed aggressive imperialism, but also supported national self-determination, including Irish Home Rule. The notion of the voluntary state has led to claims of Herbert&#8217;s anarchism, but research indicates a greater complexity to his political ideas. Overall, Herbert was an extreme libertarian who never completely lost sight of the state, although he greatly limited its role. While Herbert&#8217;s political theory was idealistic, it avoided the social prescription usually associated with utopianism. Herbert&#8217;s commitment to an ethos of radical progressivism was one he shared with other contemporary socialist and anarchist thinkers who, like Herbert, attempted to live the politics they espoused. For his political philosophy and activism, Herbert warrants acknowledgement as one of the most prominent English libertarians of the nineteenth century.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Co-Operation; Individual freedom; Individual rights; Individualism; Libertarianism; Liberty; Natural rights;</field><field name="subject">Voluntary taxation; Voluntaryism</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::360000 Policy and Political Science::360100 Political Science::360104 Political theory and political philosophy</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1908</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Veiled threats? Islam, headscarves and religious freedom in America and France</field><field name="creator">Salton, Herman</field><field name="description">For a variety of historical, cultural and political reasons, the Islamic headscarf has become an increasingly controversial matter in Europe. This is particularly the case in France, where the Parliament passed, in March 2004, a piece of legislation that prohibits students from wearing the Muslim veil&#8212;together with any other &#8216;conspicuous&#8217; religious sign&#8212;in the classroom. Although Statute 228/2004 proved highly controversial and attracted unprecedented media attention, it was overwhelmingly supported by French MPs as a response to popular opposition towards religious insignia at school and was heralded as a &#8216;liberating&#8217; piece of legislation that faithfully reasserted the beloved French principle of la&#239;cit&#233;. Overseas, the new law was less favourably perceived and was often accused of being discriminatory and of violating the students&#8217; freedom of religious expression. This thesis compares the French and American attitudes towards religious symbolism in general and the Islamic veil in particular. As in other matters, at first sight these two countries seem to adopt a very different&#8212;if not opposite&#8212;approach to religion and the Muslim veil, and so much so that their positions are often described as &#8216;irreconcilable&#8217;.  This thesis will argue that this is hardly the case. Indeed, it will show that, at least before the passage of Statute 228-2004, the French and American legal systems adopted a substantially similar approach that appeared respectful of a veiled student&#8217;s right to wear religious insignia. This, the work will also suggest, is not surprising, for contrary to popular belief, the American conception of secularism is in many respects stricter than the French idea of la&#239;cit&#233;, with the result that French &#8216;exceptionalism&#8217; on matters of religion is hardly a convincing ground for justifying the new piece of legislation. The fundamental value of a Franco-American comparison, this work will suggest, ultimately lies with the fact that such a comparison demolishes a good portion of the popular myths surrounding the affaire des foulards: that the French legal system is fiercely secular; that the American one is strongly &#8216;religious&#8217;; and that France was, in 2004, confronted with a veritable &#8216;veil emergency&#8217; that rendered the passage of the new statute all but inevitable.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">islam, religion, religious freedom, US first amendment, free exercise clause, french constitutional law, french religious history, american religious history, religious garb, religious clothing</field><field name="subject">islamic headscarf, muslim veil, france, america, conseil d'etat, religious discrimination, statute 228/2004, french law on religious signs at school</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::390000 Law, Justice and Law Enforcement::390100 Law</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2317</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The institutionalisation of data quality in the New Zealand health sector</field><field name="creator">Kerr, Karolyn</field><field name="description">This research began a journey towards improved maturity around data quality management in New Zealand health care, where total data quality management is 'business as usual" institutionalised into the daily practices of all those who work in health care. The increasingly information intensive nature of health care demands a proactive and strategic approach to data quality to ensure the right information is available to the right person at the right time in the right format, all in consideration of the rights of the patient to have his/her health data protected and used in an ethical way. The work extends and tests principles to establish good practice and overcome practical barriers. This thesis explores the issues that define and control data quality in the national health data collections and the mechanisms and frameworks that can be developed to achieve and sustain good data quality. The research is interpretive, studying meaning within a social setting. The research provides the structure for learning and potential change through the utilisation of action research. Grounded theory provides the structure for the analysis of qualitative data through inductive coding and constant comparison in the analysis phase of the action research iterative cycle. Participatory observation provided considerable rich data as the researcher was a member of staff within the organisation. Data were also collected at workshops, focus groups, structured meetings and interviews. The development of a Data Quality Evaluation Framework and a national Data quality Improvement Strategy provides clear direction for a holistic and 'whole of health sector' way of viewing data quality, with the ability for organisations to develop and implement local innovations through locally developed strategies and data quality improvement programmes. The researcher utilised the theory of appreciative enquiry (Fry, 2002) to positively encourage change, and to encourage the utilisation of existing organisational knowledge. Simple rules, such as the TDQM process and the data quality dimensions guided the change, leaving room for innovation. The theory of 'complex systems of adjustment' (Champagne, 2002; Stacey, 1993) can be instilled in the organisation to encourage change through the constant interaction of people throughout the organisation.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321200 Public Health and Health Services::321215 Health care administration</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1899</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The ecological parasitology of the Polynesian rat (Rattus exulans) on Tiritiri Matangi Island</field><field name="creator">Roberts, Mere</field><field name="description">This thesis presents a descriptive and a functional analysis of the ecology of an island host-parasite system consisting of the Polynesian rat, Rattus exulans (Peale) and its gut helminths. The results, which include an historical perspective, are presented in the form of 7 papers or sections. Each of these examines a particular aspect of this host-parasite relationship. A review of the origin and an update of the theorised dispersal of this rat from Southeast Asia to New Zealand is given in the first section of chapter one. Previous theories have derived the New Zealand populations from a line which passed through Micronesia. In accordance with new information from the Lapita cultural assemblage, this rat is now theorised to have accompanied these "Lapita" peoples through the Bismarck Archipelago and Solomon Islands, arriving in the Tonga- Samoa region about 3600-3000 Before Present (B.P.). From here, the Proto- Polynesians then dispersed further east, taking with them the commensal R. exulans, pig, dog, and chicken. This rat is thus thought to have arrived in New Zealand, the most southern and last-settled landmass in Polynesia, in the canoes of the Maori about 1000 years ago. Information on the ecto- and endoparasites of the Polynesian rat from throughout its geographical range is collated and presented in section two. This includes the results of the two surveys (one being part of this thesis) done on the parasites of this rat in New Zealand. All populations of R. exulans sampled in these two surveys came from offshore islands, to which this rat is almost totally confined, and where, on many, it is the only rodent species present. In contrast, most of the populations sampled beyond New Zealand are now sympatric with other rodent species. For the New Zealand populations only, it was also possible to identify those parasites only accidentally associated with this host; these are listed as "transients". In section three, an attempt is made to determine the probable biogeographical origins of parasites recorded from populations of this rat on "exulans only" offshore islands of New Zealand. Such a study was possible only because of the archaeologically documented commensal relationship between rat and Polynesian man. This information, detailed in section one, together with the parasitological data base assembled in section two, provided the material for this analysis. Several "heirloom" species are identified, theorised to have been inherited by this rat during speciation somewhere in Island Southeast Asia. Parasites acquired during dispersal are divided into "old" and "new souvenirs"; the former are thought to have been acquired from sympatric rodent species in Near Oceania sometime prior to 3000 B.P., and the latter from R. rattus, R. norvegicus or Mus musculus introduced in the last 200 years during European settlement in New Zealand. The conclusions further suggest that some at least of the "new souvenir" species have been acquired by R. exulans on "exulans only" offshore islands of New Zealand by cross-transfer from other rodent species which have temporarily gained access to these islands. This theory is examined in more detail in the fourth section, and reports of such accidental colonizations of offshore islands are presented as supporting evidence. In Chapter two, the influence of habitat on the population demography of the host is investigated. Nearly 1000 rats were trapped and necropsied over a 17 month period in three different habitats on Tiritiri Matangi, an "exulans only" island at the entrance to the Auckland harbour. Rank grassland which covers most of this island formed one habitat; a second consisted of forest remnants confined to gullies, and the third consisted of the small, inhabitated, lighthouse station and farmed area at one end of the island. Between-habitat differences were observed in diet, adult longevity, mean weight of immatures, the time of onset of sexual maturation, and annual reproductive output. These results suggested several modifications to existing models of this host's demography in New Zealand. Shelter in particular appears to play an important role in the demography of this species in temperate latitudes. The effects of parasitism on potential fitness parameters e.g. reproduction, and adult mortality/survival, are examined in chapter three. Based on the results obtained in chapter two, a number of hypotheses were developed, and the predictions arising from these were tested. Few significant results were obtained; these revealed habitat and some sexual interactions with the level of infection, at certain times of the year. However, no causal relationship could be established between these effects and host reproduction or mortality. It is concluded that the helminth parasites of this rat on this island have little or no effect on these host parameters, and support the suggestion that these species constitute a depauperate and well-adapted rodent parasite fauna. The last chapter presents the results of an analysis of the effects of habitat, season, host age, and sex on the distribution and abundance of the helminths of this rat on this island. Together, the graphs and the statistical analyses demonstrate that habitat has the most important influence, significantly affecting all 7 species; this effect is of greater magnitude than the other 3 variables on 5/7 of these species. Season and age also have important effects, while sex had no apparent influence. Explanations for the observed patterns are sought in known aspects of the biology of the host in the three habitats described in chapter two, and in the life cycles of the parasites. In total, this thesis provides a comprehensive account of the ecology of the Polynesian rat and its helminth parasites on Tiritiri Matangi Island. It also identifies gaps in the existing data base, formulates certain hypotheses, and makes a number of predictions all of which will hopefully stimulate further interest in this rat and its parasites.</field><field name="date">1990</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270700 Ecology and Evolution::270702 Marine and estuarine ecology (incl. marine ichthyology)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1902</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Microstructure and properties of zinc oxide nano-crystalline thin films and composites</field><field name="creator">Lee, Jim, 1963-</field><field name="description">Zinc oxide (ZnO) is a II&#8211;VI compound semiconductor with a wide direct band-gap of 3.3 eV and a hexagonal structure. ZnO is often used in the paint, paper, rubber, food and drug industries. It is also a promising material in nanotechnology applications, for example in nano-electronics and nano-robotic technology. With its wide band-gap, high exciton binding energy and high breakdown strength, ZnO can be utilized for electronic and photonic devices, as well as for high-frequency applications. To produce such optoelectronic devices, control of electronic properties, such as the nature of conduction and carrier density, is required. However, such control has proved difficult for ZnO. Much research has been done to pursue p type ZnO using different processing techniques, however, there are few reports addressing the relationships of microstructure on optical and electrical properties, ion implantation doping of ZnO and nano-ZnO polymer composites. The objectives of this project are to study the processing, composition, microstructure, electronic, optical, UV and electromagnetic shielding properties of ZnO thin films and composites; to explore ion implantation as a method to dope Al, Ag, Sb, Sn and TiN into ZnO thin films or single crystals; to develop conducting, transparent oxide films and/or p-type semiconductor for potential device applications; and to study the relationships of doping, microstructure and electro-optical properties of ZnO thin films and nano-ZnO polymer composites. The experimental work included annealing, characterizing and implantation of magnetron sputtering ZnO thins films and ZnO single crystals. Ion implantation was employed to dope ZnO thin films or single crystals with Ti, N, Sb, Al, Sn and Ag. The diffusion behaviour of implanted and annealed ZnO and the ellipsometry of implanted ZnO thin films were investigated. The relationship of microstructure and properties of as-deposited, annealed and implanted ZnO was studied. The results show that compared to direct current (d.c.) sputtering, the films produced using radio frequency (r.f.) have significantly lower resistivity, porosity and stress. The residual stress can change the band gap of ZnO thin films. Conductivity experiments suggest that the conduction mechanism of sputtered ZnO thin films involves charge transport in the conduction band and electronic hopping between the nearest neighbour donor levels. Furthermore, the optical transmission of ZnO thin films is high in the visible, with excellent UV absorption properties. It is also found that annealing alters the grain size and composition, and reduces the stress of ZnO thin films. Moreover, ion implantation causes partial amorphousness of ZnO films in the implantation zone and introduces stress and interstitial dopants. Transport of Ions in Matter (TRIM) modelling and Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometer (SIMS) analysis confirm that lighter elements implant deeper than heavy elements. The implanted ZnO shows some p type tendency and evidence of photoluminescence. Lastly, the nano-ZnO and polymer composites show excellent mechanical, good UV barrier properties.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290900 Electrical and Electronic Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2136</field></doc><doc><field name="title">New Zealand and the search for security 1944-1954: 'a modest and moderate collaboration'</field><field name="creator">Barrington, Brook</field><field name="description">In the decade which followed the Second World War, New Zealand foreign policy was preoccupied with issues of national security. The war had revealed not only that New Zealand could be threatened by Asian hostility, but also that British power could no longer be relied upon for protection. Successive New Zealand governments therefore looked for ways to reinforce the security of New Zealand. Their central objective was to seek a modest and moderate collaboration with key allies. As a result of this search for security, New Zealand foreign policy was transformed in the decade 1944-1954. Not only did politicians and officials engage in an ever-increasing round of international meetings and conferences, but the formal international obligations of the Dominion grew at a remarkable rate. New Zealand began the decade signing the Australian - New Zealand Agreement, and ended the decade a member of the South East Asia Collective Defence Treaty. In the intervening years the Dominion had become party to the ANZAM arrangement and the ANZUS treaty, and had joined the Colombo Plan. New Zealanders also played a not insignificant part in the formation and operation of the United Nations, the occupation of Japan, the Japanese peace treaty, and the Korean war. This rapid growth in the complexity of New Zealand foreign policy sprang from two sources. The first was the policy of collaboration, which involved the Dominion in a range of international activities at which New Zealand leaders would have balked had they not been in the company of key allies. The second source was a sense of institutional confidence and growing expertise. New Zealand officials and politicians had learned diplomatic skills and acquired international recognition during the Second World War, and the creation of the Department of External Affairs in 1943 meant that Dominion had both the experience and the machinery to take a much wider interest in world affairs. By 1954, links with the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth, although cherished and still very important, were no longer predominant. New Zealand's main strategic commitment remained in the Middle East, but the shifting frontiers of the cold war and the prospect of regional rather than global conflict had forced New Zealand policymakers to take greater account of events in the Pacific. This was reinforced by New Zealand's traditional policy of collaboration: both the United Kingdom and the United States had also become more involved in Pacific affairs. And as the focus of New Zealand foreign policy shifted increasingly to the Pacific region, so the relative importance of the United States as an ally increased. But New Zealand's interests remained world-wide, and this was reflected in the policy of collaboration. There was never any question of reducing links with the United Kingdom and Europe in favour of those with the United States and the Pacific. Instead, in what was sometimes to prove a delicate balancing act, New Zealand policymakers looked to accommodate both old allies and new as they adapted to the succession of the United States to Britain's position of pre-eminent world power.</field><field name="date">1993</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1909</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Molecular approaches to horticultural crop improvement</field><field name="creator">Atkinson, Ross G</field><field name="description">Plant biotechnology and molecular biology are now being used to complement conventional breeding programmes in most of the world's important crop species. The aim of the research described in this thesis was to improve New Zealand's horticultural crop plants through application of similar molecular techniques. A) Gene transfer systems for apple, pepino and tamarillo Tissue culture systems were developed for micropropagation and regeneration of apple (cv Royal Gala), pepino (cv El Camino) and tamarillo (selection Oratia Red). In all three species, transient expression of the gusA reporter gene was observed and kanamycin resistant callus was produced, following inoculation with the pKIWI110 binary vector in the avirulent Agrobacterium strain LBA4404. No transgenic apple shoots were obtained. However, transgenic pepino and tamarillo plants expressing the gusA reporter gene, kanamycin resistance and herbicide tolerance were successfully regenerated. PCR and Southern analysis provided molecular evidence for integration of foreign DNA into the genomes of transgenic pepino and tamarillo plants, but indicated deletions of the integrated T-DNAs had occurred with high frequency. Inheritance of the transgenic phenotypes was demonstrated in the progeny of transgenic tamarillo plants. B) Characterisation of polygalacturonase genes A kiwifruit genomic clone with homology to a tomato cDNA clone for polygalacturonase (PG) was sequenced over an 8.1 kb region. The sequence revealed a gene divided into nine exons, with 58% overall identity to the tomato PG gene at the amino acid level. Significant homology was also noted to PG genes isolated from peach, Oenothera organensis and maize, particularly in several blocks of conserved amino acids believed to encode the active site of the enzyme. Analysis of the kiwifruit PG promoter revealed three 81 bp direct repeat sequences just upstream of the kiwifruit peptide start codon. These repeats were also conserved in a second kiwifruit PC genomic clone. Characterisation of partial cDNA clones indicated that at least two mRNAs for PG were expressed in ripe kiwifruit. Southern hybridisation detected the PG gene at low copy number in the genomes of kiwifruit, two other Actinidia species, apple and pepino. PCR was used to amplify a fragment of the apple PG gene for sequence analysis. PG sequences were also used to help define the genetic origin of kiwifruit. A region of the PG gene was amplified and sequenced from four Actinidia species: kiwifruit (A. deliciosa), A. chinensis, A. eriantha and A. chrysantha. These sequences were used to produce a phylogeny using PAUP (phylogenetic analysis using parsimony). Two distinct lineages of PG genes were observed in the genomes of A. deliciosa, A. chinensis and A. eriantha. Within both these lineages, A. deliciosa sequences were quite distinct to those found in the other three Actinidia species, with the exception of a single sequence that was identical to A. chinensis. These results suggest that hexaploid kiwifruit is an allopolyploid with A. chinensis and at least one other Actinidia species as likely progenitors.</field><field name="date">1993</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1911</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Distributional relationships among subtidal algae, sea urchins and reef fish in northeastern New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Cole, Russell Gavin</field><field name="description">Interactions among large brown macroalgae, sea urchins, and fishes were investigated in northeastern New Zealand during the period 1988 - 1993. The Cape Rodney to Okakari Point Marine Reserve was the site of many of these investigations. The patterns of abundance of large brown macroalgae and urchins down depth gradients over a wide geographic range were compared with those reported from earlier studies, and 3 major trends were identified. First, the fucoid alga Carpophyllum flexuosum now occurs at many sites which are exposed to wave action, in contrast to earlier studies. This alga occurred most abundantly on urchin-grazed coralline flat areas. Second, at four sites in the Marine Reserve, the densities of the echinometrid urchin Evechinus chloroticus decreased with increasing depth, rather than reaching maximal densities at mid-depths, as had previously been described. Finally, at sites of decreased exposure to wave action, the coralline flats habitat did not occur at all, and dense stands of. C. flexuosum occurred, in conjunction with the ubiquitous laminarian alga, Ecklonia radiata. Following the discovery of this new algal component to exposed rocky reefs, a more detailed study of its population characteristics was initiated. The population size structure of C. flexuosum on coralline flat areas was markedly different from that of the same species in sites sheltered from wave action. These differences occurred at both offshore islands and sites near Leigh, suggesting that it was a general pattern. C. flexuosum plants on coralline flats were smaller than those from sheltered sites, and had a greater number of smaller laminae, heavier stipes, and a greater degree of branching. There was some evidence of temporal change in the morphology of C. flexuosum from coralline flats. Comparisons between a site with C. flexuosum and a site with coralline flats suggested that the activity of fish was 75% lower in the vegetated than in the unvegetated site, and the feeding rate in the vegetated site was less than 50% that in the unvegetated site. I speculate that future effects on fish activity of the invasion of C. flexuosum into a habitat which previously lacked macroalgal vegetation may depend on changes in the morphology of plants. An investigation of many aspects of the biology of E. chloroticus in different habitats was undertaken. Analysis of the body dimensions of E. chloroticus suggested that this species was relatively tall compared to other echinometrids (average ratio of test height: test diameter = 0.54), Comparisons among habitats with differing amounts of vegetation revealed only small differences in the relationship between test diameter and test height. Small E. chloroticus (&lt;40 mm test diameter) lived in crevices, while larger individuals grazed freely over the substratum. In vegetated habitats, the crevice-dwelling habit was maintained at test diameters about l0 mm greater than in unvegetated habitats. Very small (&lt;20 mm test diameter) E. chloroticus frequently covered themselves with shell. Population size structures of E. chloroticus within the Cape Rodney to Okakari Point Marine Reserve were bimodal; other localities had unimodal populations. Modal sizes varied among localities, with smallest modes (50-60 mm TD) being found at Inner Hauraki Gulf sites, and largest modes at the offshore Mokohinau Islands (70-80 mm TD). Habitat did not predictably affect population size structure. A bimodal population structure was maintained at Waterfall Reef rock flats throughout the 5-year study period. Gonad size showed seasonal fluctuations at several sites, being greatest in summer. There were few consistent differences in gonad size between biological habitats. Gonad colour varied among sites and habitats, with orange gonads generally being more prevalent in vegetated habitats, and black gonads being represented more in unvegetated habitats. Smaller urchins had greater proportions of orange gonads, while larger urchins had greater proportions of brown and black gonads. Although highly variable among individual urchins, movement of E. chloroticus was greater at unvegetated sites (0.7 m per 5 days) than at vegetated sites (0.4 m per 5 days), in the Marine Reserve. Feeding of E. chloroticus was studied at a number of sites in the Marine Reserve. Urchins frequently consumed drift algae, particularly E. radiata. C. flexuosum was consumed at less than half the rate of other macroalgae in several laboratory feeding experiments, and was chosen least frequently in a field assay of feeding preferences among 8 species of macroalgae. Boosting densities of E. chloroticus in stands of E. radiata to 60 m-2 led to destructive grazing of plants over a 2 month period - at lower densities, the urchins dispersed. Densities of C. flexuosum were effectively unchanged when urchin densities were increased to these elevated levels. As a result of these observations I speculate that feeding preferences of E. chloroticus may have a role in allowing C. flexuosum to survive on coralline flats. In a laboratory experiment, urchins from a feeding aggregation did not graze algae at higher rates than individuals from outside aggregations. Diets of both E. radiata and C. flexuosum consistently produced similar gonad volumes in urchins held in the laboratory, although gonad volumes produced were low. A preliminary experiment suggested that C. flexuosum from exposed sites was consumed at lower rates than C. flexuosum from sites which were sheltered from wave action. These differences in palatability are mirrored in the formation of stable borders between coralline flats and C. flexuosum of the sheltered morphology, and the ability of C. flexuosum of the exposed morphology to survive in the coralline flats habitat. The fish fauna of the Cape Rodney to Okakari Point Marine Reserve was shown to be different from that of a nearby area. A number of species were more abundant within the Marine Reserve. Subsequent surveys showed that there were differences in abundances of 3 large carnivorous fishes among sites within the Marine Reserve, and that population size structure and the distance within which divers could approach one species, (Pagrus auratus), clearly varied between areas within the Marine Reserve. Mean standard length of P. auratus in the central marine reserve was 40% larger than that of P. auratus outside the central marine reserve, and the average minimum approach distance was 70% less in the central marine reserve. Feeding of fish by humans in the central part of the Marine Reserve was suggested to be the main cause of the differences in responses to divers. Population size structure of, and crevice occupancy by, E. chloroticus, clearly differed between the Marine Reserve and an adjacent area, with bimodal population size structures and a 10 mm greater size of crevice occupancy occurring in the Marine Reserve. The implications of these findings for extrapolating from experiments done in one area to other areas are discussed. The major biological components of rocky reef habitats identified in this study were broadly similar to those identified in previous studies in northeastern New Zealand, and have parallels in overseas studies. Long term changes to the flora of rocky reefs in northeastern New Zealand have occurred, and appear to persist by a mechanism which had previously been discounted. Similar processes to those observed in overseas studies appear to maintain habitats (consistent recruitment of algae or urchins to habitats which they dominate), or cause them to change from one habitat state to another (e.g. grazing outbreaks by urchins). However, the predictability of the persistence of these habitats at a particular site appears to be low. Further, the precise mechanisms whereby habitats may change from one to another may also be unpredictable. I argue that there is little scope for general statements concerning the spatial and temporal occurrence, or mode, of habitat transitions on temperate subtidal reefs. This study emphasises the value of repeated descriptions of patterns of abundance, and highlights problems of extrapolation and generalisation in marine ecology. Insufficient information exists at present to comment adequately on the persistence of subtidal habitat types. This may in part stem from the types of information which have been collected in the past. Methodological problems with the use of quadrats to sample densities of organisms in areas of differing topography are therefore addressed. In conclusion, it is suggested that sampling protocols which incorporate a variety of information, gathered over as wide an area, and as intensively as possible, should be used in future research of this type.</field><field name="date">1993</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270700 Ecology and Evolution::270702 Marine and estuarine ecology (incl. marine ichthyology)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1912</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Atomic Trampoline Cavity</field><field name="creator">Liston, Gregory John</field><field name="description">Using an intense evanescent light wave as the lower mirror, and the gravitational force as the upper mirror, a vertical cavity for storing atoms can be constructed. Transverse confinement is obtained by totally internally reflecting the light off a concave as opposed to a planar crystal surface, which results in any atom reflected by the evanescent potential at a position away from the central axis receiving an impulse towards it. After a cursory discussion of atom optics and atomic cavities, we outline the configuration of the atomic trampoline cavity described above, and present analysis of the motion of atoms within it. A discussion of the classical dynamics and quantum modes in the cavity is given, together with other complicating factors which act as loss mechanisms out of the cavity. Various aspects of obtaining experimental realizations and applications of the cavity are considered. A detailed study of the quantum dynamics of atoms in the three dimensional cavity reveals that the dispersion can be adequately described in the transverse directions using a simulation involving a classical distribution of point-like atoms, where the probability density of finding an atom at a particular position in the simulation corresponds to the probability density of the atomic wavefunction. The classical simulations, however, significantly underestimate the spreading in the vertical direction. By calculating the modes of the atomic trampoline cavity, both in and out of the evanescent potential, the proportion of each of the modes in the excited state, and hence the decay rate, or linewidth due to spontaneous emission can be calculated. We found that even when the effect of the evanescent potential was included, the modes obtained correspond to those calculated by Wallis, Dalibard and Cohen-Tiennoudji [Appl. Phys. B 54,407 (1992)], who treated the bottom potential as infinitely steep and not exponentially decaying. In contrast to an optical Fabry-P&#233;rot cavity, the linewidth was found to be strongly dependent on energy. Various other cavity parameters (finesse and Q) which depend on the loss due to spontaneous emission were also calculated. Using a ring cavity rather than a laser traveling wave to provide the light that totally internally reflects off the internal surface of the dielectric crystal, we can accumulate the phase change due to the single atom bouncing into and out of the evanescent wave and altering the refractive index of the cavity. A measurement of the phase of this light will reveal information about the atom. We found that the measurement did not significantly alter the mean or standard deviation of the atomic energy distribution across the modes of the cavity, as to first order the phase change of the light in the cavity is independent of the energy of the atom. The significant change in the energy distribution was the introduction of oscillations, which occurred when the phase measured was significantly different from the expected mean. The reason for these oscillations is that the measurement implies the weighting of modes just entering or leaving the evanescent wave should be increased or decreased. Ways of bringing this currently infeasible experiment closer to being achievable using novel design mechanisms are also discussed.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1913</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Adolescent Mother and her Child: Determinants of Maternal Parenting Behaviour and Infant Development</field><field name="creator">Dixon, Robyn S.</field><field name="description">Despite having the second highest teenage pregnancy rate in the developed world, there has been an absence of New Zealand research investigating outcomes for the adolescent mother and her child The present study was designed as a first step toward redressing this situation. The aim of the study was twofold, to provide a descriptive profile of a sample of New Zealand women giving birth to their first child during adolescence, the primary aim being to identify psychosocial variables associated with maternal parenting behaviour and infant cognitive, motor and social development. One hundred and twenty, first time mothers aged between 15 years 6 months and 19 years and 9 months were interviewed in the post natal wards of Waitakere Maternity Unit in West Auckland. In addition to gathering extensive demographic data, measures of mothers' social support system, perceived stress, locus of control and knowledge of child development were taken. The second phase took place in the homes of the 80 subjects who were successfully located and agreed to further participate in the study. Again as part of this interview, demographic data were collected and, in addition to repeating the measures of social support and perceived stress, mother's satisfaction with her role as a parent was measured. Infant development was assessed using Bayley Scales of Infant Development. Finally, a 10 minute videotape was made of mother-infant interaction. During this time mothers were asked to change the infant's nappy, and then to play with their baby using a selection of age appropriate toys provided by the researcher. Following analysis of the descriptive variables, multiple regression analysis was used to identify variables associated with maternal parenting behaviour and infant outcomes. This resulted in the development of a model of adolescent parenting which suggests that social support, particularly the size of a mother's supportive network and the availability of emotional support, has a direct effect on maternal psychological status, which in turn impacts on maternal parenting behaviours. A mother's satisfaction with parenting being especially important. As expected maternal parenting behaviour is associated with infant interaction behaviour. Moreover, social support and maternal psychological status both had a direct impact on infant mental development scores. Furthermore, the results of the study have highlighted the importance of including measures of parenting satisfaction in models of adolescent parenting, a variable which up until now has been missing in research in this area. Finally, the implications of the findings for education and health professionals, and policy makers, concerned with the well being of these young women and their children are highlighted, and directions for further research identified.</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1914</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Automata-Theoretic Models for Computational Complementarity</field><field name="creator">Calude, Elena</field><field name="description">The purpose of this Thesis is to study, from the mathematical point of view, a new type of questions about finite automata, questions motivated by looking at automata as toy models of physical particles. Working along the line of research initiated by Moore, two computational complementarity principles are studied, (for finite-deterministic, complete or incomplete, nondeterministic-automata with outputs but no initial states) both theoretically and experimentally; they mimic the physical complementarity and the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen effect. Automata are studied via simulations (informally, the automaton A is simulated by the automaton B if B can perform all computations A can execute and produces the same outputs; two automata are equivalent in case they simulate each other). A new type of minimization problem will be solved and the solution is proved to be unique up to an isomorphism; the minimal automaton equivalent to a given automaton can be constructed only in terms of outputs for deterministic complete or incomplete automata, but one needs the whole internal machinery for nondeterministic automata. It happens that minimal automata are exactly the automata which may feature computational complementarity. Even if the original motivation will remain only metaphorical, the physical motivation was good to suggest new definitions and constructions (simulation, universality, complementarity) leading to new mathematical results (existence of universal finite automaton, solving in a new way the minimalization problem for nondeterministic automata).</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1915</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Biochemical and Molecular characterisation of Trichoderma species.</field><field name="creator">Dodd-Wilson, Sarah Louise</field><field name="description">The growing importance of many Trichoderma strains as biological control agents and producers of valuable metabolites and enzymes has made their distinction from other Trichoderma isolates essential. However, the use of morphological and cultural characters alone to differentiate individuals within the genus Trichoderma to a level that is most informative has proved difficult due to a lack of reliable characters. In this study, alternative biochemical and molecular techniques were assessed for their ability to differentiate between isolates of the genus Trichoderma. Fifty isolates representing the Trichoderma species T. atroviride, T. hamatum, T. inhamatum, T. koningii, T. virens, T. viride and five morphological sub-groupings of the T. harzianum species were examined. ITS sequence data, RAPD PCR and the ability of an isolate to produce the metabolite 6-pentyl-&#945;-pyrone (PAP) were all used to differentiate between morphologically indistinguishable isolates. Altogether four levels of variation were recognised. The greatest level of resolution was achieved with the RAPD PCR technique, followed by both morphological characters and sequence data from the ITSI region of the ribosomal gene complex. Sequence data from the ITS2 region provided the third level of resolution. The fourth level of resolution was achieved with both sequence data from the second variable region (D2) of the 28S-like ribosomal gene and determination of an isolate's ability to produce the metabolite PAP. Based on these results, it was proposed that a new taxonomic system be established in which individuals of the genus Trichoderma are distinguished by a combination of morphological, cultural. biochemical and molecular characters. Sequence data and RAPD PCR data were also tested for their reliability in estimating the phylogeny of Trichoderma. Sequence data from the ITSI region proved to be the most reliable for predicting the phylogeny of morphologically defined species, whereas RAPD data was most useful for predicting the unrooted phylogeny of strains of morphologically identical isolates (i.e. isolates with less than 10% nucleotide divergence). None of the data employed in the present study were able to resolve all the species tested. It was concluded that additional sequence from a more variable region would be required to achieve this. In addition to the characterisation and phylogenetic studies, two approaches were undertaken in an attempt to isolate a gene(s) vital to the production of the antifungal metabolite PAP, a metabolite believed to be important in the biological control activity of a number of the isolates under investigation. Both attempts were unsuccessful and additional studies undertaken to determine how important PAP is in the biological control activity of Trichoderma isolates were inconclusive. Nevertheless, a natural PAP deficient mutant was identified among the 50 isolates under investigation. Furthermore, synthetic PAP was found to inhibit the infection of lentil seedlings by Sclerotium rolfsii when 10 mg was added to a pot containing six seedlings and three viable sclerotia of the pathogen. The metabolite did not appear to have any detrimental effects on the growth and development of the seedlings.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1916</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Paraplegic Bodies: Self and Society</field><field name="creator">Sullivan, Martin Joseph</field><field name="description">In this dissertation it is argued that humans constitute themselves as subjects in a complex of interrelationships between body, self, and society, The effects of these interrelationships are examined through the ways in which traumatic paraplegics constitute themselves as subjects following their accidents.

Knowledge transfer costs are higher when decisions must be made on the basis of idiosyncratic knowledge scientific knowledge or assembled knowledge. Control costs are higher when there is a greater need for top management to coordinate the decisions of managers lower in the organisation. Decentralisation is more likely to take place when knowledge transter costs are high and control costs are low. Christie et al. (1993) find evidence(in the private sector) consistent with these predictions. This thesis suggests that knowledget transfer costs and control costs have a similar effect on public sector decision rights. This is evident through greater accountability. Knowledge transfer costs in the public sector are similar to those in the private sector. Control costs also have an effect in the public sector, and are higher when there is greater political visibility. There is a greater need for top decision-makers to coordinate decisions about issues that have high political visibility, and therefore less decentralisation in these circumstances.I hypothesise that the presence of high knowledge transfer costs and low political visibility in the New Zealand public sector leads to decentralisation and is associated with the use of audited financial statements. The evidence is consistent with my predictions and is robust to alternative ways of measuring explanatory variables.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1918</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Photoelectrochemistry and Spectroscopy of Conducting Polymer Electrodes</field><field name="creator">Kilmartin, Paul A</field><field name="description">Photoelectrochemistry and Spectroscopy of Conducting Polymer Electrodes Paul A. Kilmartin The conductive properties of films of polyaniline, substituted polyanilines, polypyrrole and polythiophene formed on platinum electrodes have been studied using photoelectrochemical, spectroscopic and surface science techniques. Bands due to oxidised and reduced forms of the polymers were monitored using in situ Raman spectroscopy, with polyaniline giving separate bands and polypyrrole showing an apparent shift of the main &#957;CC mode by 35 cm-1 V-1. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy allowed the elements of the polymers to be quantified into their various oxidation states, particularly through a deconvolution of the N 1s peak. Microscopic mounds of polymer were seen under atomic force microscopy consistent with the extent of polymer growth. The current response to a light flash perturbation on a milli-second time scale provided new information about the conducting polymers. For polyaniline in an insulating state, short-lived photocurrents were observed (less than 1.5 ms), while for polyaniline in a conductive state, longer-lasting photocurrents were observed (greater than 1.5 ms). Prolonged photocurrents indicative of high conductivity were observed up to a pH of 3.7, beyond which only shorter transients were obtained, consistent with previous polyaniline conductivity studies. The transition from conducting to insulating regions at more positive potentials was marked by the appearance of a short-lived cathodic photoresponse, which occurred at more positive potentials as the pH was lowered. Two models are proposed to account for the photocurrents. In the insulating state, the polyaniline film functions as a capacitance, with the fast transients being caused by discharge of surface states. In the conductive state, the prolonged anodic and cathodic photocurrents arise from redox processes with expulsion of solution species. Consistent with these models, polypyrrole showed only cathodic photocurrents (with anion release) and sulfonated polyaniline only anodic photocurrents (release of protons). The stable yellow film of parathiocyanogen (SCN)x formed by oxidation of SCN- at a platinum electrode in warm methanolic solution was studied, and was shown to be insulating and electroinactive, with short-lived photocurrents unless exposed to potentials greater than 1 V. Oxidation of SeCN- in aqueous solutions produced an analogous, though less stable, orange paraselenocyanogen film.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1919</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dealing with dilemmas: a critical and collaborative approach to staff appraisal in two schools</field><field name="creator">Cardno, Carol E.M.</field><field name="description">central intent of 'Tomorrow's Schools' reforms in New Zealand was to make schools more accountable for improving the quality of teaching by devolving responsibility for staff appraisal to principals. The researcher sought to discover what kind of dilemmas arose for two principals in the context of implementing staff appraisal policy and how their theories of practice constrained their ability to resolve complex problems. Further questions were asked about how viable it would be to mount a critical and collaborative intervention to alter practice, how the impact of the intervention could be evaluated, and what the implications of this research might be for training principals. The research shows that appraisal activity poses leadership dilemmas arising out of tensions between concern to meet organisational goals and concern for relationships among individuals. The principals responded by suppressing these dilemmas and avoiding threat with consequent ineffectiveness in the resolution of problems. Intervention within a framework of action research involved teaching the participants how to discover, critique and alter the values and beliefs which governed the defensive strategies that were counterproductive to their intentions to be open and inclusive. The result of the intervention was that the schools developed appraisal policies that disclosed purposes related to both accountability and staff development. At the Interpersonal level the principals' attempts to counter unilaterally controlling and protective tendencies in their behaviour were blocked whilst in dialogue with others by their inability to articulate the conflict in values which was at the source of their appraisal dilemmas. The research illustrates the complexity and challenges inherent in learning the theoretical and practical curriculum in order to recognise conflict, respond to it, and develop critical dialogue skills. The research concludes that training programmes for school leaders should accord significance to the expectations held of principals to perform a dual role as evaluators and developers of staff. A problem-based, interventionist form of training is recommended. Such training should focus on developing competence in critical and collaborative approaches for dealing with appraisal dilemmas.</field><field name="date">1994</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1920</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Synthesis of Natural Products Containing Hydroxylated Pyrrolidines</field><field name="creator">Park, Jae Hyun</field><field name="description">This thesis contains two parts.

It is a task that requires the orchestration of numerous skills such as reading source texts, incorporating information from the source texts within the written text, and reading the rhetorical context to interpret the task. Being such a complex activity, it has received relatively little attention. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the complexity of a writing-from-sources task within an L2 environment.  Using an ethnographic design, I examined the writing of four Chinese (L1) students with varying levels of English (L2) proficiency completing an argumentative writing-from-sources essay task for a required writing class. The task spanned two and a half weeks and required the participants to cite five sources within a 1500-word essay. Over the course of writing, I interviewed each participant several times about their writing process, observed the participants during class, and collected all notes, drafts, and reading materials.  The results revealed the complexity of the writing-from-sources task. Constructing a suitable cognitive representation of the task was one key to success and there were a number of personal and contextual factors that influenced the creation of the participants&#8217; task representations, factors such as individual background experiences, the writing process, and information from and interactions with the teacher and other people within the writing context. These factors varied in the strength of their influence from the beginning to the end of the essay assignment, and I present a tentative theory of task representation to explain the points at which these influencing factors had the greatest impact within the writing process.  Low L2 proficiency constrained the writing performance of some of the participants. This resulted in one participant avoiding elements of the writing task requirements in order to earn passing marks and two other participants producing plagiarized texts and receiving failing marks on the assignment. The two participants who plagiarized showed no ill intentions and, consequently, felt receiving zero marks for their writing efforts was unjust.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">second language writing</field><field name="subject">writing from sources</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2364</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of the mechanisms of chemical cleaning of milk protein fouling deposits using a model material (whey protein concentrate gel)</field><field name="creator">Xin, Hong</field><field name="description">It is crucial to understand the fundamental mechanisms of cleaning milk protein fouling to optimise Cleaning-in-place (CIP) process. Using Whey Protein Concentrate (WPC) gel as a model material and a rapid ultraviolet (UV) spectrophotometry, a comprehensive laboratory study on the cleaning of the WPC gel deposits from hard surface with alkaline cleaning solutions has been conducted. The kinetics of the cleaning process has been established and mathematical models have been developed in order to elucidate the influences of various parameters on cleaning process. This study has provided sound evidence that whey protein concentrate gel is a reliable simulation of the whey protein fouling deposits used in most milk protein fouling and cleaning studies. Based on treating denatured whey protein gels as biopolymers, a chemical reaction controlled polymer dissolution cleaning mechanism has been proposed. The polymer dissolution plays a major role of removing proteinaceous deposits when treated with alkaline solutions under the flow conditions tested. Similar to the diffusion of cleaning chemicals and chemical reactions, the reptation (induction) is also one of essential steps for the dissolution of WPC gels in alkaline solutions. The disengagement of intermediate reaction products (altered protein molecules) from a gel-solution interface and subsequent mass transfer of these reaction products to the bulk cleaning solutions are the rate-limiting steps for the cleaning process. The typical dissolution cleaning rate curve of WPC gels in alkaline solutions includes swelling, uniform and decay cleaning stages. This study on cleaning kinetics shows that increasing the cleaning temperature can improve the cleaning efficiency. The apparent activation energy for these three stages is 32.6, 40.5, and 38.3 kJ/mol, respectively, which is in agreement with previous research works. Increasing flow velocity enhances the cleaning process. However, this effect could be reduced when and the cleaning process gradually changes from a mass transfer-controlled process to a disengagement-controlled process, where the flow velocity is very high. The introduction of the hydrolysis, &#946;-elimination reactions and some competing chemical reactions have highlighted the complex of chemical reactions involved in cleaning of proteinaceous fouling using alkaline solutions. The changes in molecular mass distribution and SH content of WPC gel dissolved at various temperatures observed has confirmed the assumption that all these chemical reactions are temperature dependent. The investigation on the swelling, microstructural and mechanical properties of WPC gels treated with alkaline solutions also illustrates the concentration dependency of these chemical reactions. The mechanical property studies demonstrate that the chemical treatment could make WPC gel weaker and easier to be destroyed. However, the relationship between the mechanical properties and the cleaning process needs to be further studied. Based on the polymer dissolution and mass transfer theory, a mathematical model of chemical cleaning has been proposed. Various parameters, such as tr (reptation time), Rm, (constant cleaning rate), mc, (the critical mass), &#958; (rate constant in swelling stage), kA (rate constant in decay stage) and &#936; (a dimensionless parameter) have been used to characterise the whole cleaning process. Among the parameters used in the cleaning model, the constant cleaning rate (Rm) is the most important one and determines the overall efficiency of a cleaning process, which has been further predicted and expressed as a product of mass transfer coefficient and solubility of disengaged protein molecules. The successful model formulations for the cleaning rate and cleaning time under various operation conditions are a good outcome of the rational mechanisms proposed for the removal of proteinaceous fouling. This research has provided a good foundation for further fundamental research in this area and for optimising the cleaning processes.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290600 Chemical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1928</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Coronary flow mechanics: an anatomically based mathematical model of coronary blood flow coupled to cardiac contraction</field><field name="creator">Smith, Nicolas Peter</field><field name="description">Coronary blood flow through the ventricular contraction cycle has been investigated in this thesis using an anatomically accurate computational model. Using Strahler ordered morphological data and an avoidance algorithm a three dimensional finite element model has been constructed of the largest six generations of the coronary arterial network within an anatomically accurate finite element model of the left and right ventricles. Segment radii, lengths and connectivity are consistent with the literature, local network branch angles are consistent with the principle of minimum shear stress at bifurcations, and an even spatial distribution of vessel segments throughout the myocardium has been achieved. A finite difference collocation grid has been generated on the coronary finite element mesh. The Navier Stokes equations governing blood flow through elastic vessels have been reduced to one dimension and are solved on this finite difference grid using the two step Lax Wendroff method. Blood flows at bifurcations are calculated using an iterative method ensuring conservation of mass and momentum. The microcirculation networks are modelled using a lumped parameter model incorporating the nonlinear variation of resistance and compliance with pressure by fitting results from published anatomical data. The venous network is assumed to parallel the generated arterial model. The calculated blood flow through the network model demonstrates physiological pressure drops, flow rates and a regional distribution within the ventricular geometry consistent with experimental data. The intramyocardial pressure (IMP) exerted on the coronary vasculature during contraction is calculated from quasi-static solutions of the equations of finite deformation applied to the ventricular model with a nonlinear anisotropic constitutive law. IMP is found to vary approximately linearly between ventricular pressure at the endocardium and atmospheric pressure at the epicardium. IMP and vessel stretch are included in the transmural pressure radius relationship to model the effect of myocardial deformation on coronary flow. The calculated coronary blood flow through the contraction cycle shows that arterial flow is predominantly diastolic while venous flow is significantly increased during systole. Calculated time varying velocity profiles in the large epicardial vessels compare well with published experimental results. Regionally averaged velocities in small vessels show that arterial inflow is most significantly impeded at the left ventricular endocardium. Furthermore, the large time constant associated with the capillary and venule networks limits the filling of these vessels during diastole particularly at the endocardium. An increase in heart rate, modelled by reducing the time for diastole causes an increase in small vessel epicardial blood flow and a decrease in blood flow through small vessels within the myocardium. The decrease in flow is most pronounced at the left ventricular endocardium.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::291500 Biomedical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1949</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Deep hydrology of the geothermal systems in the Taupo Volcanic Zone, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Kissling, Warwick M.</field><field name="description">This thesis is a study of the large scale flows of water and heat which give rise to the geothermal fields in the Taupo Volcanic Zone (TVZ), New Zealand. To carry out this study, a super-critical equation of state module has been developed for the geothermal simulator TOUGH2, which can describe the flow of water at the conditions expected deep in the TVZ. The code is used to simulate the behaviour of a range of idealised TVZ models in 2D and 3D settings. Hydrothermal plumes which remain stable for periods comparable to the lifetime of the TVZ can occur when there is a contrast between the high permeability of the inner TVZ 'infill' region and the lower permeability exterior region. In this case, downflows of cool surface fluid in the inner TVZ 'sweep' the geothermal heat across the TVZ at depth to the permeability barrier, where the heated fluid ascends to the surface in discrete plumes. This behaviour occurs in 2D models, where separate plumes form at each side of the high permeability infill region, and also in 3D models of caldera-like structures, where perhaps four hot plumes can form around the perimeter of the caldera. This notion is then applied to the complete TVZ hydrological system, where a permeable &#8216;envelope&#8217; is defined by the location of the Taupo Fault Belt and the currently known volcanic centres in the TVZ. The permeability within this envelope varies spatially according to the geothermal heat flux, and the region outside has relatively low permeability. The spatial variation of the geothermal heat flux is obtained by summing the measured heat flows from the geothermal fields for a number of areas across the TVZ. In this model, the geothermal fields form about the boundary of the envelope, as in the TVZ, and bear a striking resemblance to the actual TVZ geothermal fields. Finally, a new simulation code, NaCl-TOUGH2, is developed to provide a tool for future modelling involving the commonest chemical species in the TVZ - salt. The code incorporates the complete phase diagram for salt-water mixtures and involves liquid, vapour and solid phases over a wide range of temperatures, pressures and salt concentrations. The code is used to solve a number of simple geothermal and mathematical problems.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1951</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Structural studies of the fibrillar architecture of normal and softened bovine articular cartilage</field><field name="creator">Chen, Min-Huey</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::291400 Materials Engineering::291499 Materials engineering not elsewhere classified</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1938</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The De Saint-Venant equations in curved channels</field><field name="creator">Nalder, Guinevere Vivianne</field><field name="description">After introducing the subject of curvilinear flow, particularly in the context of meandering natural channels, this thesis then describes the three conventional models for unsteady flow in open channels, namely kinematic, diffusion and dynamic. These descriptions are in terms of the straight channel de Saint-Venant equations. The discussion also considers some aspects of the diffusion model which raise questions as to the appropriateness of the usual engineering approach to this model. As to date, these models treat curvature cursorily, if at all, the models are then expanded to incorporate curvature in a more systematic manner. This is done by deriving the de Saint-Venant equations in terms of curvilinear coordinates. The models are then presented in terms of the curvilinear mass-conservation and various forms of the curvilinear momentum equation. The new models are found to be expressed by equations of the form 'linear model + curvilinear correction' thus allowing the engineer to estimate the size of any curvature effect. The derived dynamic model is compared with a laboratory study, and the results indicate that the new curvilinear model is a reasonable description of dam-break flow. Subsequent calculations, based on field data, of the celerity of the dynamic wave illustrate how big the corrections can be.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290800 Civil Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1936</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Artificial intelligence in a hybrid system with an industrial application</field><field name="creator">Cammell, Geoffrey Martin</field><field name="description">This dissertation introduces the Artificial Computer Expert (ACE), a system designed to assist non-computer skilled personnel utilise complex computer software through the use of artificial intelligence in the creation, selection and execution of programs. The system comprises three parts: 1. A graphical interface and conceptual framework which allows an expert to define the structure of his knowledge relating to his field. 2. A compiler to work through such a structure, forming partial solution paths which indicate the relationships that exist in the structure. 3. An interpreter to run through the solution process, joining together the partial solution paths and creating instances of data files as required in order to reach the overall goal. The ACE system is presented in the context of an industrial application, demonstrating how it may be used to form sawmill cutting patterns (which indicate how lumber is to be milled from a set of logs). This application belongs to a class of scheduling problems known as &#8216;cutting stock problems&#8217;, which for anything other than small or simple cases typically require the presence of an on-site scheduling expert. The application developed produces acceptable cutting patterns without the need for such a scheduling expert, using the same software tools currently used by mill management to plan their production.</field><field name="date">1994</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290500 Mechanical and Industrial Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1941</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Long-term scheduling of harvesting with adjacency and trigger constraints</field><field name="creator">McNaughton, Alastair</field><field name="description">The forest harvesting problem, FHP, is described. A review of the existing literature is presented along with an analysis of the strengths and limitations of various attempted solutions. The diversity of model evident in recent papers is noted. The difference is explained between a strategic model that sets long-term harvesting goals in terms of total area to be cut each year, and a tactical model that produces a short-term schedule of actual blocks. Special attention is devoted to the development of FRI&#8217;s Forestry-Oriented Linear Programming Interpreter, FOLPI, which is currently used to formulate an LP model of the strategic planning problem. Reasons are presented for the desirability of an integrated model, embracing both strategic and tactical decisions, which is capable of optimisation. Accordingly the project then proceeds to a thoughtful and detailed construction of such a model. Particular care is taken to examine the status and function of FOLPI within this model. A column generation algorithm is then developed to solve the relaxed linear program formulation. Finally powerful constraint branching techniques are utilised to obtain the desired optimal solution to the integrated model. Throughout the development of the project the Whangapoua forest in Coromandel, New Zealand has been used as a case study. A concluding section presents numerical output from some of the exhaustive computational analysis associated with this application.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1957</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Machinability study of particle reinforced aluminium metal matrix composites</field><field name="creator">Lin, Richard Jyh-Tsong</field><field name="description">In this thesis, machinability of particle-reinforced aluminium metal matrix composites, Comral-85 and DURALCANTM, has been studied. Continuous turning of round composite bars, using polycrystalline diamond (PCD) inserts has been selected as the test method. The test conditions included cutting speeds varying from 75 to 700m/min and feed rates from 0.1 to 0.4 mm/rev with constant depth of cut of 0.5 mm. The main wear mechanism of machining these Al MMC materials is abrasion by the reinforcing particles and the primary type of tool wear is flank wear. Linear regression techniques has been used to derive Taylor equations to describe the tool performance. The results show that the time required to reach the tool wear limit decreases with increased speed and feed rate. However, the volume of material removed before reaching the wear limit actually increases with the higher feed rate. This apparent anomaly has been reconciled in a modified Taylor equation. As for surface finish, the feed rate is found to be a more dominant factor than cutting speed. The higher the feed rate is, the worse the surface finish becomes. The surface finish is found to improve with tool wear at early stage because of the increase of tool nose radius; after that it starts deteriorating as a consequence of excessive tool wear. The change of feed rate is also more influential on the variation of machining forces than that of cutting speed. Using the same regression techniques, the general machining force-tool wear equations are derived. The results show that the equation derived from the feed force is better suited to monitor tool wear than that derived from the cutting force. The general relationship between tool wear and power consumption has also been established. The chip forming mechanism while machining DURALCANTM MMC has also been studied by using an explosive charged "quick-stop" device. The primary chip forming mechanism involves the initiation of cracks due to the high shear stress, followed by the decohesion of particles and matrix material within the chip due to the stress concentration on the edge of the particles. The crack propagation is enhanced through the microvoid coalescence within matrix material. The fracture and the sliding of material then follow to form semi-continuous "saw-toothed" chips.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1959</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Methods and techniques for parameter and distribution function estimation in cascaded digital channels with and without memory</field><field name="creator">Berber, Stevan M.,1950-</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290900 Electrical and Electronic Engineering::290901 Electrical engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1958</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Quantitative near-infrared imaging spectroscopy of fruit</field><field name="creator">Martinsen, Paul</field><field name="description">In this work the development and construction of a new near-infrared imaging spectrometer utilising inexpensive components is presented. The instrument is applied to measuring the distribution of constituents in fruit, in particular, soluble solids and dry matter in kiwifruit. The spectrometer, designed for collecting spectral-images of fruit, uses a diffraction grating for spectral dispersion, a scanning slit system for spatial resolution and a CCD detector to allow images of samples to be examined in different wavebands. The system described has a spectral range of 650 nm to 1100 nm at a resolution of better than 5 nm. Each spectral-image contains 150 x 242 pixels on the spatial plane and 755 pixels for the spectral ads. An interchangeable imaging lens enables investigation of samples at different scales. With a 58 mm camera lens objects up to 50 mm x 50 mm may be imaged at a spatial resolution of up to 2 line-pairs per millimetre (0.5 millimetre). One difficulty with calibration using spectral-images is that the independent measurements of concentration often come from areas much larger than a pixel. For spectral-imaging to be useful it is important that the calibration can estimate concentration at the pixel level. In effect this means estimates calculated using the model are more accurate than the independent measurements used in calibration. Using synthetic spectra and an investigation of the principal component regression algorithm, the ability of a calibration, from spectral-images, to estimate these pixel level concentrations has been demonstrated. To calibrate the instrument for measuring soluble solids concentration and dry matter content in kiwifruit, reflectance spectra from 650 nm to 1100 nm were collected from cut sections of 200 fruit. A near-infrared calibration was obtained by recording the soluble solids concentration and dry matter content of plugs extracted from thin slices of the fruit and relating these to the spectra collected. A prediction error of 1.2 &#176;Brix over a range of 4.7 - 14.1 &#176;Brix was achieved. It was not possible to obtain a useful model for estimating dry matter due to interference from specular reflections off free juice in the fruit. The models developed were used to show the spatial distribution of soluble solid concentrations over cut sections of fruit.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::299900 Other Engineering and Technology::299901 Agricultural engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1945</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation on diffuser augmented wind turbine design</field><field name="creator">Phillips, Derek Grant</field><field name="description">Diffuser Augmented Wind Turbines (DAWTs) are one of many concepts to have been proposed to reduce the cost of renewable energy. As the most commercially viable, they have been the focus of numerous theoretical, computational, and experimental investigations. Although intimated in these studies to be able to augment the power output of a wind turbine, the extent of this power increase, or augmentation, the factors influencing DAWT performance, the optimal geometric form and their economical benefit remained unanswered. It is these issues that have been addressed in this investigation. In reviewing historic investigations on DAWTs it has been identified that excessive wind tunnel blockage, inappropriate measurement technique, varied definitions of augmentation, and the inclusion of predicted performance based on incorrect assumptions have in general led to the overstatement of DAWT performance in those studies. In reassessing the performance of the most advanced of those DAWT designs, Grumman's DAWT 45, it has been calculated that the actual performance figures for the 2.62 exit-area-ratio and 0.488 length-to-diameter ratio DAWT were an available augmentation of 2.02, a shaft augmentation of 0.64 and a diffuser efficiency of 56%. By contrast, the development of the Mo multi-slotted DAWT in this investigation has yielded a design whose shaft augmentation of 1.38 was achieved by a diffuser with exit-area-ratio of only 2.22 and overall length-to-diameter ratio of 0.35. Such performance improvement has been obtained by gaining both an understanding of the flow characteristics of DAWTs and the geometric influences. More specifically it has been shown that: the velocity across the blade-plane is greater than the free-stream velocity and increases towards the rotor periphery; that the rotor thrust or disc loading impacts upon diffuser performance by altering the flow behaviour through it; and that DAWTs are able to maintain an exit pressure coefficient more negative than that attainable by a conventional bare turbine. The net result is that DAWTs encourage a greater overall mass-flow as well as extract more energy per unit of mass-flow passing through the blade-plane than a conventional bare turbine. The major drivers of DAWT performance have been shown to be the ability of the design to maximise diffuser efficiency and produce the most sub-atmospheric exit pressure possible. Parametric investigation of the various DAWT geometric components has shown peak performance to be obtained when: the external flow is directed radially outward by maximising the included angle of the external surface in conjunction with a radially orientated exit flap; by applying boundary-layer control to a trumpet shaped diffuser via a pressurised cavity within the double-skin design of the multi-slotted DAWT; having an exit-area-ratio of the order of 2.22; and by employing an inlet contraction with inlet-area-ratio matched to the mass-flow passing through the DAWT under peak operating conditions. To translate the available augmentation into shaft power a modified blade element method has been developed using an empirically-derived axial velocity equation. The resulting blade designs whose efficiencies reached 77%, twice those of Grumman, highlight the accuracy of the modified blade element method in calculating the flow conditions at the blade-plane of the multi-slotted DAWT. It was also noted that the rotor efficiencies remain below 'best practice' and therefore offer the potential for further increases in shaft augmentation. However, in order to achieve such gains, a number of limitations present in the current method must be addressed. In assessing the likely commercial suitability of the multi-slotted DAWT a number of real-world influences have been examined. Shown to have little if any effect on DAWT performance were Reynolds number, ground proximity and wind shear. Turbulence in the onset flow on the other hand had the beneficial effect of reducing separation within the diffuser. Finally, DAWT performance was assessed under yaw misalignment where it was shown that the multi-slotted DAWT performed favourably in comparison to that associated with a conventional bare turbine. The major drawback identified in the DAWT concept by this investigation was its drag loading and the fact that drag and augmentation were interdependent. The result is that the cost of a conventional DAWT is dictated by the necessity to withstand an extreme wind event despite the fact that augmentation is only required up to the rated wind speed. The overall conclusion drawn was that in order to optimise a DAWT design economically, and therefore make the DAWT concept a commercial reality, a creative solution that minimises drag under an extreme wind event would be required.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290500 Mechanical and Industrial Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1940</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Bridge abutment scour countermeasures</field><field name="creator">Van Ballegooy, Sjoerd</field><field name="description">The use of riprap and cable-tied blocks as scour countermeasures at bridge abutments is investigated. Riprap is the most common armouring scour protection method used at bridge abutments and approach embankments. Despite the widespread use of riprap protection, the guidelines for its use at bridge abutments are based on limited research. The aim of the experimental study was to determine the requirements of riprap and cable-tied block apron countermeasures to protect bridge abutments from scour damage, and to produce design guidelines for their use. The two types of bridge abutments used in the experimental study were a spill-through abutment situated on the floodplain of a compound channel, and a wing-wall abutment sited at the edge of the main channel. The spill-through abutment experiments were run under clear-water conditions, and the variations in the scour hole geometry were measured for different abutment and compound channel geometries, apron widths and apron types. The wing-wall abutment experiments were run under live-bed conditions, and the settled apron geometries were measured for different flow depths, flow velocities, apron widths, apron types and apron placement levels. The flow fields around the abutments were also measured for both abutment types. The clear-water spill-through abutment results show that the protection aprons do not significantly reduce the scour depth at abutments, but instead deflect the scour hole further away from the abutment, protecting it from scour failure. The experiments also show that cable-tied block aprons allow the scour hole to form much closer to the abutment compared to equivalent riprap aprons. Equations were developed to predict the scour hole position and size, and the minimum apron extent required to prevent the scour hole from undermining the abutment. For the live-bed wing-wall abutment experiments, the troughs of the propagating bed-forms undermined the outer edges of the aprons, causing them to settle. Equations were developed to predict the settled apron geometry at the equilibrium scour conditions. The predicted scour hole depth and position for clear-water scour conditions, or the predicted apron settlement geometry for live-bed scour conditions can be used in a geotechnical stability analysis of the abutment. The geotechnical stability analysis forms the basis of the abutment scour countermeasure design procedure, which was developed from the experimental study. Further experimental work is required to increase the robustness of the bridge abutment scour countermeasure design procedure and make it applicable to a wider range of situations.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290800 Civil Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1944</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Nonlinear structural analysis using strut-and-tie models</field><field name="creator">To, Nicholas Hin Tai</field><field name="description">Increasing popularity of the strut-and-tie methodology among research communities and practising engineers is due to its rational analytical approach and its superiority, compared to the conventionally employed empirical methods for analysing disturbed regions in structural systems. Nevertheless, this analysis methodology is not used as a routine procedure in design offices, primarily because of the perceived ambiguity and complexity involved in appropriate model formulation. In addition, until recently application of the strut-and-tie methodology has been limited to the prediction of strength, with utilisation of this modelling technique to capture nonlinear structural deformation being rather minimal [ACI Bibliography (1997)]. The research project reported herein represents an original contribution to the development of the strut-and-tie methodology by providing a systematic approach for applying this modelling technique to nonlinear structural concrete analyses. The study proposes a orginally developed computer-based strut-and-tie model formulation procedure that permits prediction of the nonlinear monotonic and cyclic response of structural systems with distinct reinforcement details. The procedure being presented in this thesis is a refined version of that reported previously [To et al. (2001 &amp;.2002b)]and the accuracy of the analytical modelling is verified using experimental data. Several issues pertaining to model formulation are thoroughly investigated. These issues include the strategy of model formulation for Bernoulli (or beam) and disturbed regions of structural systems, the satisfactory positioning of model elements, the appropriate stress-strain material models for concrete and reinforcing steel, the suitable effective strength of model elements, the inclined angle of diagonal concrete struts in beam and column members, and the concrete tension carrying capacity and associated tension stiffening effect. In addition, the seismic response of various prototype structures when subjected to the experimentally employed cyclic forces and the time-history earthquake loadings was predicted using the originally developed cyclic strut-and-tie models. A summary encapsulating the findings of this project and recommendations for future research work in the area of nonlinear strut-and-tie modelling is also presented.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290800 Civil Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1952</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The oxidation reactions of heterogeneous carbon cathodes used in the electrolytic production of aluminium</field><field name="creator">James, Bryony Joanne</field><field name="description">A technique has been developed that allows the gasification reaction rates of representative samples of carbon-carbon composite materials to be examined. The technique involves heating the sample in a controlled and monitored environment; the product gases of the reaction are then analysed by a mass spectrometer, allowing their identification and quantification. The technique was used to characterise the oxidation reactions of cathode carbons. These materials are composites and so the oxidation reactions of their constituent raw materials were also examined. Surface area was determined for each sample, allowing specific rates of reaction to be determined, normalising surface area effects. The anodes, cathodes and sidewalls of aluminium smelting cells are made of composite carbon materials comprising filler materials (such as coke, anthracite and graphite) and a binder (almost exclusively coal tar pitch). Whilst the oxidation of anode carbons has received extensive study the oxidation reactions of cathodes have been neglected largely because they have not been a cause of smelting cell failure. However, with the longer lives now being achieved from smelting cells the long term degradation reactions, such as oxidation, will have to be considered. Oxidation of cathodes in the area of the collector bar will increase resistance and affect the heat balance of the cell. Gasification reactions of carbon materials are frequently characterised using techniques such as thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA). These techniques are accurate for examining such reactions when the sample is of small size and a single carbon type. To characterise composite carbons correlations have been made between the overall oxidation resistance (determined by weight loss) and the ignition temperature of one of the constituent materials (determined by TGA). The results obtained using the new technique of product gas analysis (PGA) revealed an exponential dependence of oxidation rate on temperature for the carbons examined. At higher rates the limiting condition appeared to be mass transfer through the pores of the sample. Arrhenius plots of reaction rates allowed the activation energy of oxidation to be determined for each material. When the rate was controlled by the chemical reactivity of the material the activation energies determined agreed well with values obtained from the literature. The two graphites examined had activation energies of 164 and 183 kJ.mol-1, Ea of graphite has been measured in the range 175-281 kJ.mol-1, the latter figure being for a highly pure graphite. For the two anthracites Ea was ll3 and 118 kJ.mol-1, literature values have it between 100 and l5l kJ.mol-1. The pitches, used as binders of cathode carbons, had Ea equal to 112 and 123 kJ.mol-1, values from the literature range from 121-165 kJ.mol-1. Activation energies were determined for the cathode materials, and were clearly influenced by the reactivity of the constituent materials. An amorphous cathode carbon, having nominally 30% graphite, had an activation energy of 121 kJ.mol-1. A semigraphitic cathode material comprising 100% graphite in a pitch binder had an activation energy of 123 kJ.mol-1. The similarity of these values to those for Ea of the pitch and anthracite indicates that the binder phase is having a strong influence on cathode reactivity. These values of Ea accord well with values determined for similar samples, reported in the literature ranging from 114 to 138 kJ.mol-1. A semigraphitised cathode material had an activation energy of 176 kJ.mol-1 in the same range as that of graphite. This sample oxidised significantly less rapidly at all temperatures. The variation in reactivity of the constituent materials of cathode carbons accounts for the highly selective oxidation behaviour observed in these materials. Porosity development is rapid as binder matrix is preferentially oxidised, leading to an acceleration of oxidation rate with increasing burnoff. The rate begins to decelerate once all the binder matrix has been oxidised, the residue being less reactive than the starting material. The structure of the materials was quantified using X-ray diffraction (XRD). A peak ratio method was employed, comparing the intensify of the 4oz peaks of cathode carbons and a standard electrographite. Once effects of cathode porosity had been normalised an excellent correlation between increasing peak intensity ratio and increasing oxidation resistance was found.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290600 Chemical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1935</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Auckland child pedestrian injury study: a case-control study</field><field name="creator">Roberts, Ian Gray</field><field name="description">Pedestrian injuries are the leading cause of death in New Zealand children between the ages of one and fourteen years. Although child pedestrian mortality rates are declining, mortality rates in New Zealand are substantially higher than those of comparable motorised countries. For the children who survive pedestrian-motor vehicle collisions, the injuries are often particularly severe. Pedestrian injuries are a leading cause of severe brain injury in childhood, with high levels of long term disability. However, very little is know about the risk factors for child pedestrian injury and as a consequence there are few well established prevention strategies.  The Auckland child pedestrian injury study is a population based case-control study designed to identify and assess the contribution of potentially modifiable risk factors for pedestrian injuries in childhood. In particular the study was designed to examine the risks associated with traffic volume, vehicle speed, parked vehicles and the availability of safe areas for children&#8217;s play.  The study was conducted between 1 January 1992 and 1 November 1993. Cases were all children, younger then fifteen years, killed or hospitalised as a result of a pedestrian-motor vehicle collision in the Auckland region. Both motor vehicle traffic and motor vehicle non-traffic (driveway related) pedestrian injury cases were included. controls were a random sample of the child population. Two controls were selected for each traffic pedestrian injury case and three for each non-traffic pedestrian injury case. Controls for school aged cases were randomly selected from school rolls. Controls for preschool cases were selected by first randomly selecting a school aged child and then, using the street address of this school aged child as the starting point, visiting homes until an eligible pre-school control child was found.  The parents of 600 children participated in the study, the parents of 200 cases and the parents of 400 controls. Of the 200 cases, 156 were injured on public roads and 38 were injured in residential driveways, the remaining 6 children were injured in car parks and public parks. The response rate in the case group was 97%, the response rate in the control group was 99%. Exposure information was collected by way of interviewer administered questionnaires and the direct measurement of environment factors.  High traffic volume is a major risk factor for child pedestrian injury. Children living in neighbourhoods with the highest traffic volumes had close to ten tines the risk of pedestrian injury. There was a dose response relationship with a steady increase in the magnitude of the risk as traffic volume increased. Vehicle speed was also a strong risk factor for child pedestrian injury and may be particularly important in residential streets. Having a street with a mean vehicle speed of over 40 kph within 500 metres of the home increased the risk of child pedestrian injury six fold.  A high density of on street parking was associated with a fourfold increase in risk of pedestrian injury. Children from homes without a fenced play area were at a significantly increased risk of pedestrian injury, although the prevalence of this risk factor in the Auckland population was very row. Children from homes where the play area was unfenced were at a significantly increased risk of injury, close to twice the risk of children from homes where the play area was fenced. For driveway related pedestrian injuries, children from homes where there is no fence separating the driveway from the play area had twice the risk of injury.  The Auckland child pedestrian injury study has provided, for the first time, information on the aetiology of child pedestrian injury in a large population based sample in New Zealand. In addition the study has provided the opportunity to examine a number of methodological issues in this comparatively new sphere of epidemiologic inquiry.</field><field name="date">1994</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1943</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Control and optimisation of coagulant dosing in drinking water treatment</field><field name="creator">Edney, Daniel B.

The primary aim of the research was to examine the nature of the relationships between young people's responses to televised alcohol advertising and drinking-related behaviours. The research was based on two surveys, one with l0 to 17 year olds and one with 18 to 29 year olds. The l0 to 17 survey involved 500 randomly selected face-to-face interviews in New Zealand's three largest urban areas. The 18 to 29 survey involved 1012 interviews. Respondents were randomly selected from throughout New Zealand and interviewed using a computer-assisted telephone interviewing (CATI) system. Both surveys asked about responses to specific alcohol advertisements, which were ones these age groups had been more exposed to. One of the two key response measures identified how frequently they recalled having seen the advertisement; this was labelled recalled exposure. Positive response to the advertising was measured by liking of the advertisement. Structural equation modelling (SEM) was used for the analyses, but this was preceded by correlation and regression analyses. On the basis of factor analyses that preceded the structural equation modelling, most of the modelling was based on the responses to the three beer advertisements in each study. 10 to 17 year old survey: The findings from the structural equation modelling were consistent with the hypothesis that positive responses to beer advertising (as measured by liking) were contributing to an increase in expected frequency of future drinking. The data were also consistent with the beer advertising contributing to an increased frequency of current drinking, although the relationship was just under the 0.05 level of significance. There was some limited evidence that recalled exposure may be associated with the drinking status of 10 to 13 year olds but, because of the small number of drinkers in this age group, this result needs to be interpreted with caution. The regression analyses indicated that recalled exposure was a predictor of 10 to 17 year olds' perceptions of how often their age/gender group drank and how accepting their friends were of drinking and occasional drunkenness. Other survey responses were also indicative of an influence of alcohol advertising on young people. Alcohol advertising was an important source of information about drinking, particularly for the 10 to 13 year old males. Almost half of these younger males accepted the portrayals in alcohol advertising as realistic and almost two thirds of them felt that alcohol advertising does encourage teenagers to drink. 18 to 29 year old survey: This study provided support for the hypothesis that more positive responses to televised beer advertisements resulted in larger quantities of alcohol being consumed on typical drinking occasions by 18 to 29 year old New Zealanders. It did not provide support for the hypothesis that drinking larger quantities of alcohol led to more positive responses to beer advertisements. The model showed that positive responses to beer advertisements had both a direct influence on quantity and an indirect influence, via its influence on positive beliefs. This study also provided support for the hypothesis that more positive responses to beer advertising were associated with increased alcohol-related problems. As with the 10 to 17 year olds, recalled exposure was related to perceptions of peer influence and behaviour. It was a significant predictor for female perceptions of peer quantities consumed and male and female perceptions relating to peer approval of drunkenness. The regression analyses also identified that recalled exposure was a predictor of males saying they were drinking more than the year before, however a SEM that specified reciprocal paths between these two variables found neither path to be significant. Discussion and implications This research has identified the importance of examining positive responses to alcohol advertisements. This acknowledges the active recipient of advertising who responds positively to advertising that offers valued outcomes. It also emphasises the importance of considering emotional/affective responses to advertising. However, the study also indicates that the weight of advertising is important, as reflected in the cognitive measure of recalled exposure. This appears to be having most influence on perceptions of what is normative behaviour. The results of the SEMs must be viewed as tentative, given the exploratory nature of the analyses and the limitations of cross-sectional surveys. However, as for all the previous studies, relationships have been identified between measures relating to alcohol advertising and those relating to alcohol consumption. While it is not possible to make definitive statements about directions of influence between these variables, these studies have all provided data that are consistent with the theory-based hypothesis that alcohol advertising does have an influence on alcohol consumption by young people.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321200 Public Health and Health Services::321216 Health promotion</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1960</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The application of support vector machines to compression of digital images</field><field name="creator">Robinson, Jonathan</field><field name="description">Methods exploring the application of neural networks to still image compression are detailed in both the spatial and frequency domains. In particular the sparse properties of Support Vector Machine (SVM) learning are exploited in the compression algorithms. A classic radial basis function (RBF) neural network requires that the topology of the network be defined before training. An SVM has the property that it will choose the minimum number of training points to use as centres of the Gaussian kernel functions. It is this property that is exploited as the basis for image compression algorithms presented in this thesis. Several novel algorithms are developed applying SVM learning to both directly model the colour surface and model transform coefficients after the surface has been transformed into the frequency domain. It is demonstrated that compression is more efficient in frequency space. The Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) is used to transform the colour surface into the frequency domain. A counter-intuitive result is shown where mapping the DCT coefficients to a 1-dimensional function for SVM modelling produces better results than SVM modelling of the 2-dimensional transform surface. Results are presented in comparison to the JPEG image compression algorithm. In the frequency domain, results are superior to that of JPEG. For example, the quality of the 'Lena' image compressed 63:1 for JPEG is slightly worse quality than the same image compressed 192:1 with the RKi-1 algorithm presented in this thesis. Due to the commercial value of the algorithms detailed in this thesis, a patent has been filed.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::299900 Other Engineering and Technology::299999 Engineering and technology not elsewhere classified</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1937</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Aspects of the ecology and management of small mammalian predators in northern New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Gillies, Craig</field><field name="description">Each chapter in this thesis has been written as a separate paper intended for later publication. Rather than write one summary, an abstract for each chapter has been given in the order they are presented in the thesis. Chapter I. The prey species of domestic cats (Felis catus) in two suburbs of Auckland city, New Zealand. The prey brought in by 80 cats (Felis catus), over a year was monitored in two suburbs of Auckland New Zealand. The survey technique followed that of Churcher &amp; Lawton (1987) where cat owners were asked to record (and if possible keep) the prey their cats brought in. The results for the year indicated that there were distinct differences in the type of prey taken by cats in each area. Rodents were the most important prey brought in by domestic cats in an urban / forest fringe habitat and invertebrates were the main prey brought in by domestic cats in a fully urban habitat. Birds and lizards were the second and third most important prey groups in both study areas. Rat and mouse snap trap indexes which were run at each study location, did not detect rodents in the urban habitat. The results from the urban/forest fringe concurred more with studies of feral cat diet in New Zealand whilst those from the urban area compared more to studies of domestic and stray cat diet in urban areas overseas. There were seasonal trends in the prey captured in each area and in both areas cats hunted less over the winter months. Chapter II. Diets of coexisting alien mammalian carnivores in Northern New Zealand. 120 feral cats, 85 stoats (Mustela erminea), 28 weasels (M. nivalis) and 16 ferrets (M. furo) were caught over three years, in Northland, New Zealand. The gut contents of these animals were examined and their food habits described. The main prey groups of cats were (in order of importance by weight), lagomorphs, rodents (Rattus spp &amp; Mus musculus), other mammals, birds and invertebrates. The main prey of stoats were rodents, birds, lagomorphs, skinks (Cyclodina spp) and invertebrates. Skinks, followed by mice, were the main prey of weasels. Rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) were the most commonly occurring prey item in the ferret guts. The food habits for cats and stoats were compared between different habitats within the Northland region where these animals were collected from. There was little difference between habitats, but invertebrates occurred more frequently and lagomorphs less frequently in the diet of animals from forest habitats compared to those from forest / pasture and coastal habitats. No differences were found in the prey of male and female cats, but invertebrates occurred more frequently in the guts of sub-adult cats compared to adult cats. Skinks occurred more frequently in the guts of female stoats, which tended to take smaller prey items than males. Chapter III. Home range of introduced mammalian carnivores, feral cats (Felis catus), stoats (Mustela erminea) and a ferret (M. furo) at Trounson Kauri Park, Northland, New Zealand. The minimum home ranges of eleven feral cats, four stoats and one male ferret were examined by radio telemetry at Trounson Kauri Park in Northland New Zealand. The average minimum home range of male feral cats was 305 &#177; 74ha. This was not significantly larger than the 122 &#177; 35 ha minimum average home range of female cats. The minimum average home range of three male stoats was 108 &#177; 19 ha and the minimum home range of one female stoat was 50 ha. The male ferret had a minimum home range of 179 ha. There was no overlap spatially, in the home range of three adult male cats. There was also very little spatial overlap in the home range of four female cats. There was substantial home range overlap with four sub-adult male cats. The home ranges of these sub-adult male cats also overlapped spatially with those of the adjacent females and adult males. The home ranges of two male stoats overlapped spatially to some degree and the home range of another male stoat overlapped that of the female stoat substantially. The home range of the male ferret overlapped the home ranges of all of the cats occupying similar areas of the park. The home ranges of two male stoats overlapped the home ranges of the adjacent cats but not into the "core" areas of those cats ranges. Chapter IV. Secondary poisoning of introduced mammalian carnivores during possum and rodent control operations at Trounson Kauri Park, Northland New Zealand. Predatory mammals were monitored by radio telemetry through a 1080 then brodifacoum poison baiting operation at Trounson Kauri Park in Northland, New Zealand to target possums (Trichosurus vulpecula) and rodents (Rattus rattus, Rattus norvegicus &amp; Mus musculus). All six feral cats (Felis catus), and the single stoat (Mustela erminea) and ferret (Mustela furo) being monitored at the beginning of the operation died of secondary poisoning following the 1080 operation. A further two cats and four stoats were radio tagged and monitored through the ongoing poisoning campaign using brodifacoum in a continuous baiting regime. None of these radio tagged carnivores died of secondary poisoning. However, tissue analysis of additional carnivores trapped at Trounson found that cats, weasels (Mustela nivalis) and to a lesser extent stoats did contain brodifacoum residues. The duration that the radio tagged predators were alive in and around Trounson Kauri Park suggested that the secondary poisoning effect was much reduced under the continuous baiting strategy, compared to the initial 1080 poison operation. Chapter V. Managing alien mammals in mainland New Zealand: The implications for predator/prey interactions in complex communities. Recent advancements in alien pest mammal control technologies have enabled conservation managers to attempt long term, large scale, predator and browser control programmes at mainland sites in New Zealand. At Trounson Kauri Park (in Northland, New Zealand) feral cats, ferrets, stoats and weasels plus rodents and possums were controlled for two and a half years. Early results from Trounson suggested that some native birds and plants responded positively and quickly to the control of these alien pest mammals. However, the management also affected the predator-prey and predator-predator interactions, within the mammalian community, with changes in the predator guild and some prey species increasing in abundance. The long term effects of these responses within the mammalian community to control efforts are unclear. A review of the international literature served only to confirm the view that managing alien mammals where re-invasion is constant will be a complex task. Conservation management at mainland sites like Trounson Kauri Park, may in effect be acting as crude mammalian predator removal experiments. Monitoring changes in predator-prey interactions and predator-predator interactions at this and other intensive management sites over sufficient time frames could provide scientists with the critical ecological data required to construct useful predictive models. The ability of managers to target specific pests at critical times would represent a significant advancement in controlling predatory mammals on the New Zealand mainland.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300800 Environmental Science</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1942</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ecological dynamics of the green-lipped mussel, Perna canaliculus, at Ninety Mile Beach, northern New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Alfaro, Andrea Casandra</field><field name="description">The New Zealand green-lipped mussel, Perna canaliculus, is farmed by an aquaculture industry (&gt; NZ$ 150 million/year) that is dependent on mussel juveniles (spat) collected from unpredictable and unreliable wild sources for more than 80% of its mussel seed requirements. Most wild-caught spat is collected from the surf zone at Ninety Mile Beach, northern New Zealand, where unique environmental conditions cause the accumulation and transport of spat attached to drift algae, which arrive to the shore in great quantities (up to 100 tonnes at once). This study is the first to investigate the ecology of mussels at Ninety Mile Beach throughout their life history, including reproductive behavior, micro-scale settlement patterns on filamentous macroalgae, accumulation and transport of mussel spat to the shore, colonization of the rocky intertidal, and adult population dynamics. Histologic investigation of 4 intertidal and 2 subtidal populations revealed that females and males were well-synchronized throughout their reproductive cycles, with a prolonged spawning season from June to December, when temperatures were lowest and rising. Comparisons of gonad indices and maximum shell length indicated high productivity in certain populations, which likely contribute to the high larval availability of the area. Experiments showed that mussel spat preferentially settled on fine-branching natural and artificial substrata, with correlation evident between mussel shell size and degree of branching. Furthermore, greater numbers of mussels settled on node versus internode areas within natural and artificial substrata. Chemical cues for mussel settlement also were studied using phytogel plates spiked with algal extracts, which were preferred over control plates by mussel larvae/post-larvae in the field, and by hatchery-reared larvae in the laboratory. Three intertidal populations were investigated at different temporal and spatial scales. Mussel concentrations in seawater were higher after spawning for both small mussels (&lt; 0.25 mm) in August, and for larger mussels (&gt; 0.5 mm) in March. Settlement patterns within quadrats cleared of mussels in 2 habitats (adult mussel bed and adjacent areas covered with algae) were studied from July 1999-March 2001. Primary settlement (mussels &lt; 0.5 mm) was found to dominate the algal habitats at the beginning of the spawning season in August, while secondary settlement (mussels &gt; 2.0 mm) was higher in the adult mussel bed late in the spawning season (November-March). Monthly surveys of undisturbed quadrats indicated that a peak in new recruitment coincided with a peak in adult mortality in August. At Scott Point, massive mortality for 2 years in August was followed by a dramatic re-colonization of the empty spaces by juveniles. Settlement patterns of mussels on suspended ropes in the water column were investigated at 3 water depths inside and outside Ahipara Bay during 2 spawning seasons (1999-2000). Mussel settlement was higher for small mussels (&lt; 0.49 mm) in shallower water (2 m water depth) in August, and higher for larger mussels (&gt; 1.0 mm) at greater depths (18 m water depth) in September-December. Mussels found on shallow-water ropes may have settled directly from the plankton, whereas mussels on ropes near the bottom (18 m) may have transferred from macroalgae tumbling on the seafloor. Environmental conditions associated with mussel spat arrival to the beach (spatfall events) were studied by statistical analysis (1990-1998; daily, monthly, inter-annually) of wind speed/direction, tidal range, water temperature, swell height/direction, and records of spatfall events/amounts. Spatfall events/amounts were more abundant during days of strong offshore winds. Swell height in the onshore direction was significantly correlated with spatfall events/amounts. Storm events (wind speeds &gt; 20 m/s) were most frequent between May-August; spatfall events/amounts were more numerous 4 months later (September-October). Years with more storm events (El Ni&#241;o/La Ni&#241;a episodes) were associated with significantly higher spatfall events/amounts.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270700 Ecology and Evolution::270702 Marine and estuarine ecology (incl. marine ichthyology)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1953</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Amyloid in Huntington Disease: identification, purification and partial characterisation of protein constituents</field><field name="creator">McGowan, Daniel P.</field><field name="description">Huntington disease (HD) is a progressive, autosomal dominantly inherited, neurodegenerative disease that is characterised by involuntary movements (chorea), cognitive decline and psychiatric manifestations. HD is one of a number of late-onset neurodegenerative diseases caused by expanded glutamine repeats, with a likely similar biochemical basis. It has been suggested that the disease-causing mechanism in Huntington disease (and the other polyglutamine disorders) is the ability of polyglutamine to undergo a conformational change that can lead to the formation of very stable anti-parallel &#946;-sheets; more specifically, amyloid structures. This hypothesis is supported by evidence that polyglutamine forms amyloid-like protein aggregates in vitro, which stain with Congo red (a histological stain for amyloid) and exhibit green birefringence under polarized light. Further support for this hypothesis is provided by evidence of Congo red staining with green birefringence, of purified aggregates from HD brain captured on cellulose acetate filters. This study describes the first finding of amyloid-like inclusion bodies in situ, in HD brain. Inclusions possessing an amyloid-like structure were identified by Congo red staining and polarized-light microscopy in the cortex and striatum of HD brain, but these were absent in both normal control brains and Alzheimer's disease brains. Amyloid-like inclusions were of a similar size to the immunohistochemically-detected neuronal inclusions reported by other investigators, however the frequency of the former was far lower than the latter and the relationship between the two types of inclusion is uncertain. Efforts to purify and characterise the amyloid-forming protein(s) in HD utilised the methodologies used to purify amylin from amyloid plaques in the diabetic pancreas, with a number of refinements. Internal fragments of three different proteins, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), histone H3 and hypothetical protein FLJ20623 were co-purified with the amyloid component of HD brain based on their increased abundance relative to control brains, and subsequently characterised. The role of these proteins in HD is investigated and discussed. In addition, an ~4285 dalton protein was co-purified with the amyloid component of HD brain; this protein was noticeably absent in control brain and displayed unusual biochemical properties, however an amino-acid sequence could not be determined. Interestingly, a protein of the same approximate size, and displaying similar properties, was purified from poorly soluble protein aggregates formed in polyglutamine-expressing cultured cells. SDS-PAGE and Western analysis of sub-cellular fractions of HD and control brain revealed a novel pattern of proteolysis at the N-terminus of huntingtin in HD relative to control, that is supported by recent literature. Myelin basic protein was demonstrated to co-migrate with an N-terminal huntingtin-positive peptide, with apparent molecular weight of ~20 kDa, using tryptic in-gel digestion and protein sequencing. This N-terminal huntingtin-positive peptide and the ~4285 dalton protein described above were both purified from amyloid-containing fractions and both resisted N-terminal protein sequencing. Due to the aberrant migration of polyglutamine-containing proteins in polyacrylamide gels, a possible identity between these peptides is proposed. Laser capture microscopy and tandem mass spectrometry were investigated as potential methods for the purification and characterisation of amyloid-forming proteins in HD and the further development of these techniques may enable the realisation of these aims in the future. The major contribution of this study has been the finding of amyloid-like inclusions in Huntington disease brain. This finding places HD and by association the other polyglutamine disorders into the category of amyloid diseases, and suggests that strategies to prevent amyloid accumulation, a focus of Alzheimer's Disease research, may be of much wider application to glutamine repeat disorders such as HD or vice versa.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::320700 Neurosciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1933</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cardiovascular disease risk factors in Pacific adolescents: the Auckland high school heart survey</field><field name="creator">Schaaf, David</field><field name="description">Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of mortality in New Zealand. The most current evidence indicates that the burden of cardiovascular disease is greatest among Maori and Pacific peoples and Pacific peoples have the highest mortality rate for cerebrovascular disease [1]. There is substantial scientific evidence that cardiovascular disease has its origin early in life and that a person's risk of cardiovascular disease is determined by the synergistic effect of all the cardiovascular risk factors over time. The Auckland High School Heart Survey (AHHS) is an epidemiological survey designed to determine the prevalence of risk factors for cardiovascular disease in an adolescent high school population in New Zealand. It takes a 'lifecourse' and primary prevention approach to reducing the incidence of cardiovascular disease. The aims of the study were to determine cardiovascular risk factor levels in, and compare the cardiovascular and diabetes risk factor levels between, Pacific and European students and the main Pacific communities (Samoan, Cook Islands, Tongan, and Niuean). The AHHS was a school-based cross-sectional survey of 2,549 adolescent students, across 10 Auckland High Schools. A cluster sampling technique was used to obtain the target of 1000 Pacific participants, to enable Pacific ethnic-specific analysis. The study specifically aimed to determine ethnic-specific differences in lifestyle, intermediate and outcome variables that have been established as cardiovascular risks. Lifestyle variables included: smoking, alcohol consumption, leisure-time physical activity (LTPA), television exposure and sun exposure. The intermediate variables analysed included: body mass index (BMI), waist to hip ratio (WHR), percentage body fat (PBF) and physical work capacity 170 (PWC170). The outcome variables included: total cholesterol (TC), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLC), ratio of total cholesterol to high density lipoprotein cholesterol (TC:HDLC), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLC), triglycerides (TG), fasting blood glucose (FG), urinary micro albumin (UA), systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP &amp; DPB). Demographic variables analysed included: sex, age, ethnic group, school, socio-economic status and growth development and maturation. The AHHS study results showed that demographic variables were strongly associated with both intermediate and outcome variables. The findings showed that there were significant ethnic variations between the four main ethnic groups (Pacific, Maori, Asian and European) in risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Pacific participants had the highest BMI and PBF. Pacific participants had the lowest levels of PWC170. With regard to outcome variables, Pacific adolescents had lower levels of TC, HDLC and LDLC compared to Europeans. However, Pacific participants had higher levels of TC:HDLC, FG, TG and DPB. To a lesser degree, lifestyle variables were also associated with other variables. However, the weaker association was likely due to measurement error. The findings of the AHHS study show that ethnic differences present in the adult population are already established among adolescents [2]. Some significant differences were also found between the Pacific ethnic groups (Samoan, Cook Islands, Tongan and Niuean). Among Pacific participants, Cook Islands participants also had the highest level of adjusted mean PWC170. With regard to outcome variables (lipids, fasting glucose and blood pressure), Tongan participants had lower TC, LDLC and TC:HDLC compared to Samoans. However, Tongan participants had significantly higher levels of TG compared to Samoans. For Pacific participants, Cook Islands participants significantly differed from Samoan in smoking, alcohol consumption and PWC170. Cook Islands participants were more likely to have tried smoking for the first time and at an earlier age. They were also more likely to smoke daily and to smoke higher amounts than the other Pacific ethnic groups. Cook Islands participants were more likely to have tried alcohol and at an earlier age. They were also more likely to be drinking alcohol weekly or more often when compared to Samoans. The AHHS study is one of the first pieces of epidemiological research undertaken in New Zealand that provides evidence that there are significant differences between Pacific ethnic groups for this age group. The AHHS study was also able to identify the determinant that explains ethnic differences in outcome variables. BMI was the most significant variable in determining the ethnic differences in outcome variables (lipids, blood pressure and fasting glucose). The AHHS study results showed that Pacific participants had the highest BMI levels of all the ethnic groups, followed by Maori. Television watching was the one lifestyle risk factor that was positively associated with BMI. The most effective variable in terms of decreasing mean difference in BMI was PWC170. PWC170 was significantly lower in Pacific, Asian, and Maori participants compared with European participants. Pacific participants had the lowest levels of PWC170 compared to all other ethnic groups. The AHHS findings support early interventions and programmes targeted to adolescents to reduce the incidence of cardiovascular disease. The findings which show that there are significant differences between Pacific ethnic groups for this age group, may warrant some specific public health initiatives being targeted directly to Pacific ethnic-specific groups. In addition, interventions and programmes that target reducing BMI and improving physical fitness should have an impact on a number of important cardiovascular risk factor outcome variables in adolescents, including: blood pressure, lipids and fasting glucose.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321200 Public Health and Health Services::321207 Indigenous health</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1947</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mental disorders in general practice</field><field name="creator">Khin, Natalie R.</field><field name="description">Background: There is a high rate of mental disorders among general practice attendees that is associated with substantial morbidity, disability and global burden. As a consequence GPs play a pivotal role in ensuring that patients with mental disorders are recognised and optimally treated. While there is little doubt of the role GPs play in managing mental illness in general practice the literature suggests a proportion of patients will go unrecognised or else be inadequately diagnosed and in some instances inadequately treated by their GP. The known problems of under diagnosis of mental disorders has been seen until recently to be a problem of GP knowledge and skill, which has led to the close scrutiny of GP performance in this field. In response to this close scrutiny has been the development of a wide range of physician education programs aimed to improving the clinical performance of GPs. However, more recently it has been acknowledged that reasons for low recognition and inadequate treatment of mental disorders in general practice is not only the GPs lack of skill and knowledge, but instead involves a complex interplay of GP, patient and systemic factors unique to GPs, their patients and the general practice setting. Therefore there is a growing interest in research to not only explore ways to improve the clinical performance of GPs, but to also gain a better understanding of the range of issues that GPs are confronted with when managing mental disorders in general practice. Aim: There were two aims of this research: 1) examine GP attitudes, reported confidence and behaviour pertaining to the detection, diagnosis and management of mental illness in general practice (Study One); and 2) describe the epidemiology of depression in general practice and investigate symptom attribution styles as it relates to depression (Study Two). Methodology: In Study One 800 randomly selected rural and urban GPs in the North Island were invited to complete the Attitudes, Reported Confidence and Behaviour Questionnaire Revised (ARCBQ-R). The ARCBQ-R had been previously piloted and reliability and validity issues addressed and published elsewhere. In Study Two, 15 general practices were randomly selected from a database of Auckland General Practices, of which 35 consecutive general care attendees were recruited from each of the 15 general practices. Consenting patients completed a self report questionnaire on mood and health and a computerised version of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) questionnaire (depression module only). Results: Study One: Four hundred and sixteen (52%) GPs completed the ARCBQ-R. GPs are confronted with a wide range of mental disorders in their day-to-day practice, with a predominance of depression and anxiety. GPs were most confident in detecting, diagnosing and treating depression and were most confident in prescribing antidepressants, particularly SSRIs for depression and anxiety. GP confidence in detection, diagnosis and treatment of mental illness was influenced by a number of GP factors such as: interest in mental health, previous mental health training, gender and exposure to mental disorders in their practice. Systemic and patients factors were also reported to influence the way in which GPs recognise and manage mental disorders in their practice. Only a small proportion of GPs reported to use solely DSM-IV or ICD-10 classifications when making a diagnosis, and the majority relied on informal ways to diagnose mental disorders in their patients, which raises questions about the appropriateness of formal diagnostic classifications in general practice. Training needs for this group of GPs involved both treatment and diagnostic issues pertaining to more complex disorders. GPs believed that shared care of mental disorders is the most effective way to provide optimal care for patients. However a number of issues pertaining to availability and assessibility of secondary mental health services along with structural issues such as cost, time and extended consultations in general practice must be addressed before this model of care can work to its full potential. Study Two: A total of 475 general practice attendees agreed to take part in this study. Approximately 20% of general practice attendees met DSM-IV criteria for major depression in the last 12 months and 12% for major depression with a recency of '1 month to less than 2 weeks'. Just under 5% of the sample met DSM-IV criteria for dysthymia, of which 80% had comorbid major depression. A greater proportion of participants who were divorced or separated, unemployed or looking for work, younger in age, of Maori ethnicity and had a history of mental illness met criteria for DSM-IV major depression. Compared to non-depressed participants, depressed participants in this study reported significantly more missed work or social activity in the last year due to emotional problems. With the aid of two screening questions for depression, GPs in this study accurately identified 75% of depressed general practice attendees. The most common attribution style amongst general practice attendees was a normalising attribution style. Patient attribution styles was not found to influence the level of depression detection by GPs, instead past and current illness profiles influenced GP detection rates of depression. Conclusion: The current research findings report figures and trends consistent with overseas studies, not only demonstrating the high prevalence of mental illness, particularly that of depression present in general practice attendees, but the many issues that shape mental health care in general practice. Inline with Klinkman's 'Competing Demands Model' GPs perform three important functions: 1) to identify mental disorders in the community; 2) directly provide mental health care to patients; and 3) a referral agent to secondary mental health services. Like Klinkman's model, results derived from the two studies suggest GPs attitudes towards mental health will shape the level of involvement across these three functions. Results derived from 'Study One' and 'Study Two' extends on Klinkman's model to incorporate 'shared care' as a potential model for managing more severe complex disorders. However, before such a model of 'shared care' can be implemented it is essential that accessibility and communication channels between primary and secondary sectors are improved, and structural funding arrangements including the appropriate remuneration for GPs time is addressed. In reality not all GPs will be interested in managing mental illness in their practice and therefore will not have the motivation to acquire and maintain a level of knowledge sufficient to work with patients with mental illness, whether it be in the capacity of 'shared care' or solely the responsibility of the GP. However, it is not unreasonable to expect GPs to have the necessary skills and ability to at least detect and diagnose mental illness in their patient population, and if necessary refer patients on to secondary mental health services. Prerequisite training in mental health, training in diagnostic classifications along with considerations around their appropriateness in general practice, a sound knowledge of patient risk factors for mental illnesses and established networks with secondary mental health services is necessary before GPs can successfully fulfill these roles.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321200 Public Health and Health Services::321204 Mental health</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1929</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Non-filterable metals (NFM) in the atmosphere</field><field name="creator">Ito, Masayoshi, 1967-</field><field name="description">A new air sampler, the Mist-UV sampling system, has been developed to trap and detect metals and metal compounds present in atmospheric samples, as non-filterable metal (NFM). The Mist-UV system is based on the combination of two ideas, mixing the filtrated air sample with nitric acid mist and simultaneous ultraviolet irradiation of the mist. Atmospheric NFM in the introduced air samples, which were first passed through a 0.2 &#181;m filter, were oxidised by UV irradiation and dissolved in the nitric acid mist. The trapped metals resulting from the NFM in nitric acid were quantitatively determined using ICP-MS. Using the Mist-UV system, measurements of atmospheric NFM concentrations were carried out to obtain their temporal and spatial trends in Auckland, New Zealand. Five metals (Mg, Al, Cu, Ba and Sr) were detected as NFM in ambient air. Elevated atmospheric concentrations of Mg, Cu, and Ba were detected in midsummer and in daytime samples. The UV oxidisable fraction dominated the NFM and high enrichment factors (EFcrust) were found for these metals. This suggested that natural emissions of organometals or reduced metals were responsible for the elevated atmospheric concentrations. Meteorological factors, particularly air temperature, light irradiation and rainfall, promoted biogenic activity and resultant NFM emissions. Remarkably high concentrations of Al and Sr as NFM were discovered in several air samples and were dominated by the non-oxidisable compounds. This implies that the sources of Al and Sr were mainly from inorganic or oxidised metals associated with fine particulates. Wet and dry soils appeared to be the sources of Mg+Ba and Al+Sr, respectively. Plant emissions are recognised as important sources of Mg, Cu and Ba as NFM in ambient air, whereas the suspension of fine particulates derived from road dust and soil enriched with non-oxidisable compounds are seen as the major sources of Al and Sr. The emissions from automobiles and seawater samples were found to be unimportant NFM sources. The NFM concentrations were found to be significantly higher than concentrations of particulate metals, therefore the atmospheric importance and role of NFM cannot be ignored in the estimation of global metal circulation and budgets.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300800 Environmental Science</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1954</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Money and the constitution</field><field name="creator">Mikkelsen, Adam</field><field name="description">In the past ten years, the world has witnessed a transformation in the relationship between governments and the supply of money. A number of countries, including the United Kingdom, New Zealand and the 11 European countries participating in EMU, have made their national central banks 'independent'. Inflation is at a post World War II low, and there a general recognition that inflation cannot, in the long term, create employment or boost economic growth. The economic consensus is that the best monetary policy is the pursuit of price stability. However, these changes to monetary regimes have been a pragmatic response to the problem of high inflation. There has been little recognition of the constitutional implications of the supply of money. I argue that this pragmatic approach is constitutionally dangerous. Upon examining the history of money, it is clear there are fundamental property rights associated with the issue of money. There is a strong need for monetary arrangements to be identified as constitutional issues, and for constitutional rules to be developed and applied in relation to the issue of money. This thesis analyses the appropriate relationship between governments and money from a constitutional perspective. Chapters II-VI examine the following issues: &#8226; the constitutional principles which should guide the behaviour of any government in relation to money; &#8226; the historical development of money and its theoretical qualities; &#8226; the difference between 'commodity' and 'fiat' money and the constitutional implications of their respective monopoly supply by governments; and &#8226; the constitutionally ideal monetary regime. Chapters VII, VII and IX then examine the existing monetary regimes in New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and in the European Union, and I compare these regimes to the constitutionally ideal monetary order identified in Chapter VI. The penultimate chapter examines electronic payment systems over the Internet, and assesses the possible impact these will have on governments' monetary monopolies in the future. The fundamental conclusion of the thesis is that adherence to constitutional principles demands that money be supplied on a private competitive basis. Notwithstanding that many central banks are now 'independent', the way money is supplied today - by governments possessing monetary monopolies - is contrary to the principles of constitutionalism.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::390000 Law, Justice and Law Enforcement::390100 Law::390103 Constitutionalism and constitutional law</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1956</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of contaminants on Austrovenus stutchburyi - using biomarkers to detect sublethal stress</field><field name="creator">De Luca-Abbott, Sharon B.</field><field name="description">This thesis examines sublethal stress responses in the common New Zealand estuarine bivalve, Austrovenus stutchburyi (cockle). The approach used throughout this thesis is a refinement of the biological indicator approach of Adams (1990), in which biomarker data are collected primarily at the individual and sub-organismal levels, but with additional measurements at the population and community levels. In this research several biochemical and physiological biomarkers are used to assess effects of contaminants on energetics, fecundity and growth of cockles. Adenylate energy charge (AEC) and total adenylate nucleotide pool (TANP) are biomarkers that have previously not been used with A. stutchburyi, and provide new information on energy cycling for this species. RNA concentration has also not previously been used with cockles, and this biomarker is correlated with growth. Glycogen concentration and condition indices are used to indicate reproductive potential and overall health. In order to fully investigate the utility of this comprehensive suite of biomarkers, their performance in laboratory and field situations was tested. Temporal variability in AEC, TANP and glycogen was analysed over two years for two populations of cockles in a northern harbour. The results indicated seasonal patterns for all biomarkers, with AEC reaching a maximum value in spring, TANP being lowest in winter, and glycogen concentration being high over spring and summer. Variability in biomarker response between cockles sampled at low tide and high tide was analysed in a laboratory experiment simulating exposure to air during low tide. Adenylate energy charge was found to be significantly lower in cockles after exposure to air for 4 hours, highlighting the importance of standardised collection protocols. These initial patterns, as well as spatial variability in biomarker response, were further investigated at several sites within a second harbour south of Auckland. There was little among site difference in glycogen concentration, and the data suggested that differences in site characteristics, such as sediment quality and type, were driving the mixed response patterns of AEC, TANP and condition. Because of inherent variability in field conditions, a series of laboratory experiments was then undertaken to assess responses under carefully controlled conditions. Cockles were challenged with PAHs, chlordane and tributyltin at two different doses, and biomarker response (AEC, TANP, glycogen and RNA) measured. One trial examined the effects of a one-off pulse of contaminant, in which sediment containing cockles was dosed at the outset of a 14-day experiment with a high concentration of contaminant. A daily dose of this same concentration of contaminant was supplied to the sediment for 14 days in a second trial to assess effects of a more continuous discharge. There were virtually no significant differences in biomarker response between treatments and controls for either trial, suggesting that the experimental setup may have been causing sublethal stress in some way. Finally, in order to maximise experimental control whilst maintaining environmental realism, a manipulative field experiment was undertaken in which cockles were transplanted from an uncontaminated site to a series of uncontaminated and contaminated sites in one of Auckland's major harbours. Biomarker response (AEC, TANP, glycogen and RNA) was measured in the transplanted and the autochthonous populations two weeks and eight weeks after transplantation. An ability to regulate adenylate nucleotides was detected, as cockles transplanted to contaminated sites had reduced TANP but maintained AEC levels. There were significant differences in glycogen and RNA among sites, with highest levels detected in cockles transplanted to an uncontaminated site. This suite of biomarkers showed great utility for use in environmental quality assessment. It is recommended that an approach such as that used in the Mussel Watch programme in the United States be employed for cockles, in order to monitor estuarine ecosystem health in New Zealand. The transplantation of cockles to estuaries where there are concerns about environmental quality, and the use of TANP, glycogen and RNA concentration to assess sublethal stress, has potential as a sensitive and cost-effective environmental monitoring technique for estuaries in New Zealand.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270700 Ecology and Evolution::270702 Marine and estuarine ecology (incl. marine ichthyology)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1955</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Restoration of threatened species populations: tuatara rehabilitations and re-introductions</field><field name="creator">Ussher, Graham</field><field name="description">The role of scientific theory in encouraging greater efficiency and accountability for the restoration of threatened species populations is assessed for an endemic New Zealand reptile, the tuatara Sphenodon spp. The value of examining assumptions underlying concepts such as 'habitat requirements' theory and incorporating scientific principles into species recovery are discussed and perceived habitat needs for tuatara tested through experimental application. Species restoration in New Zealand, especially re-introductions, are typically undertaken as one-off, non-replicated, management exercises (trials). The lack of comparative controls for trials means that the reason for success or failure of management actions cannot be identified accurately and therefore, cannot be used to improve the probability of success for subsequent re-introductions. Trials also reinforce conservative re-introductions of species to habitats in which species are known to survive, because the risk of failure is inherently lower than re-introductions to dissimilar habitats where habitat suitability is unknown. An alternative approach is to plan management actions as experiments. Testing the full range of perceived habitat needs of species as experimental comparisons identifies the relative importance of tested factors (e.g. predators, refuges) for species recovery and identifies new management strategies (e.g. reduced level of predator control). Constructing testable hypotheses for the environmental factors thought to affect the success of restoration projects for tuatara identifies (among others) three factors: 1. absence of the introduced rat, the kiore (Rattus exulans) 2. presence of seabird colonies 3. presence of open canopy forest The threat posed by kiore to established tuatara populations was investigated by determining the existence and degree of food competition before and after an eradication program for kiore on offshore islands. Kiore successfully out-competed tuatara for favoured food items, but the degree of competition differed between forest types. Competition for food was greater in the early regenerating forest than the mature forest. These data support models which propose that kiore are but one of a number of historical and current environmental factors influencing the persistence of native fauna and that management tools other than eradication may enable restoration of fauna in the presence of kiore. To test the importance of two environmental factors, forest development and the availability of refuges, in determining the establishment of new populations of tuatara, a planned experimental reintroduction was conducted on Moutohora Island. Tuatara were released into sites where the forest was young with a closed canopy and older with a more open canopy, and in sites where refuges (seabird burrows) were distributed evenly at high densities and where burrows clumped with few burrows between patches. Vegetation age and burrow dispersion had no measurable effect on the survivorship or condition of tuatara. Although tuatara released in areas where burrows were clumped dispersed significantly further from their release points and continued to disperse away from release sites throughout the study, tuatara in all release sites were considered to still be reproductively viable 16 months after the re-introduction. Therefore, sites which support open and closed canopy forest, and seabird burrows at high and low densities should be considered as habitat options for future reintroductions of tuatara. Testing habitat needs as well-planned experiments offer more reliable information to guide future reintroductions than that generated by trial releases or releases to similar locations. Future reintroductions of tuatara and other wildlife should be designed as experiments to test declared mixes of habitat factors. This will accelerate species recovery by identifying important habitat prerequisites for re-introduction and management options for achieving these, thus refining criteria used for selecting new sites and increasing confidence, efficiency and accountability of subsequent management actions. An example of designing re-introductions as experiments is included as a plan for the re-introduction of tuatara to Tiritiri Matangi Island.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">herpatology</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270700 Ecology and Evolution::270708 Conservation and biodiversity</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1939</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Microbiological aerosols in drainage systems</field><field name="creator">Walls, Kelvin L. (Kelvin Leonard), 1950-</field><field name="description">Drainage codes exist to provide appropriate and safe means of disposal of effluent from buildings. If it is seen that those codes may not be written in a way which leads to an assured appropriate outcome, then they need to be questioned. Accordingly, this thesis follows up on the author's concerns regarding the approach taken to the layout of drainage under today's building regulatory regime. Under the New Zealand Building Code any standards may be used or any approach may be taken to methods of building, drainage and plumbing, providing the approach used can be justified as complying with the non-prescriptive objectives and performance requirements of the Building Code. Under this approach drains are now being installed more often under buildings with their maintenance access points within the building. This situation, and the consequent likely emission of microbiological aerosols, are cause for concern: that is the airborne release of microscopic particles. The "Report of the Departmental Committee - Intercepting Traps in House Drains" of 1912 from the UK, parts of which are quoted in Section 7.0, reinforced these concerns of the author. But these concerns were not shared by many others who have a major influence on the form and shape of our buildings, and it was assumed that current code requirements may not have been based on any significant research. Based on a relatively widespread lack of knowledge, there was a scenario of doubt and denial as to whether or not there were shortcomings in current code requirements in New Zealand. This provided incentive for the research project within this thesis, on the basis that there may be encouragement for future code requirements to be based on even more research in order to confirm their validity. This thesis demonstrates that the ambiguity in existing approved methods of compliance with current building codes fails to adequately protect the populace from adverse potential health effects.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::310000 Architecture, Urban Environment and Building::310100 Architecture and Urban Environment::310101 Architecture</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1931</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Palynological investigations into the early Quaternary and late Tertiary vegetation and climate of west Auckland, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Byrami, Mairie</field><field name="description">This thesis presents a detailed late Tertiary and early Quaternary pollen record from two c. 40 m long sedimentary cores (the Patiki cores) from west Auckland. The cores consist of slightly to highly carbonaceous clays, with a thick sand incursion at mid-depth. The sediments below the sand incursion are aged through palynostratigraphy as mid-late Pliocene (Hautawan). The sediments above the sand incursion have numerous interbedded tephras, and are aged through a combination of Isothermal Plateau Fission Track dating, palaeomagnetism and orbital tuning to the marine oxygen isotope record as 1.0 &#8211; 1.4 Ma (MIS 28 - 45, Marahauan substage). The Tertiary pollen record portrays regional vegetation assemblages of extinct Nothofagus brassii-type species and modern-day podocarps, with local modern-day oligotrophic mire assemblages. A cool climatic phase is indicated by a period of dominance of an extinct member of the Proteaceae. However, the duration of this interval cannot be determined due to a lack of numerical age control for the record. The Quaternary pollen record consists of mostly extant pollen types. It shows multiple compositional shifts from Nothofagus-dominated to conifer-dominated regional vegetation, with local oligotrophic mire vegetation except for a fully aquatic phase at mid-depth (MIS 35). The primary axis score curve of a detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) of the pollen record was correlated to the marine isotope record, and shows that the Nothofagus-dominated intervals correspond to cool climate stages, while the conifer-dominated intervals correspond to warm stages. The strongest cool stage maximum is indicated at 12 - 13 m depth (MIS 34), where the vegetation consists of Fuscospora, Prumnopitys taxifolia and heath shrubs. The strongest warm stage maximum is indicated at c. 9 m depth (MIS 31) where the vegetation consists of Dacrydium forest. Astronomically forced climate change is an important driving force behind vegetation composition changes portrayed in the Quaternary pollen record. The majority of warm stage maxima inferred in the pollen record (conifer-dominated intervals) coincide with periods of maximum obliquity, and vice versa for inferred cool stage maxima (Nothofagus-dominated intervals). The modulating effect of eccentricity on precession is influential on the pollen record during MIS 31 and 34. The relationship between selected climate indicator taxa and calculated insolation values indicates that reduced seasonality in Auckland during warm climate stages favours Agathis, Dacrydium, Phyllocladus and Halocarpus, while increased seasonality during cool climate stages favours Nothofagus &#8216;fusca'-type, Nothofagus menziesii, and Prumnopitys taxifolia. In both situations the trees are probably responding to a combination of changes in mean global temperatures and seasonality, and reacting according to their own adaptive responses to astronomically driven climate change. The Quaternary pollen record contains plant mixtures that do not occur in New Zealand today, for example Agathis australis with Nothofagus menziesii, and Halocarpus bidwillii / biformis. The climate was probably cooler than it is in Auckland today, but never as cold as the last glacial maximum in Auckland when grasslands were present. Under more equable climatic conditions, with less extreme glacial and interglacial cycles, populations of comparably 'warm' and 'cool' climate taxa were probably able to shift throughout the region and mixed to a greater extent than is currently observed. The overall vegetation response to climate change (particularly above MIS 36) is analogous to that recorded in northern New Zealand in the late Pleistocene, and supports a negligible change in climatic preference of the main canopy species since the early Quaternary. The phytosociological idiosynchracies in the pollen record are not inconsistent with the known tolerance limits of the taxa involved, or with the individualistic nature of vegetation composition.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::260000 Earth Sciences::260100 Geology::260113 Palynology</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270700 Ecology and Evolution</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1950</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Investigation into 'Public Choice' Theory and its Implications for Education in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Devine, Nesta</field><field name="description">'Public Choice Theory' is defined by its proponents as 'the application of economics to politics'. This thesis attempts to describe Public Choice Theory in its component parts and as a coherent and potent contemporary factor in the political and educational scene. The methodologies used are Foucauldian 'genealogy' and 'immanent critique', that is, the theory is examined in its historical context and in terms of its own logic. The process by which this theory has affected the educational situation in New Zealand is examined, and set in the context of the wider application of economics to politics in this country generally. Some of the major policy documents concerning Education are read closely in order to identify the extent of the Public Choice Theory influence on them, Whilst Public Choice Theory is commonly associated with the 'New Right' it is also the key element of 'analytic Marxism'. Whether from 'left' or 'right,' Public Choice Theory, as a basis for the content or organisation of education is presented as a historically contingent theory, making dubious claims to scientific validation, and bringing about consistent changes in the nature of education and the construction of persons engaged in it.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1962</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reacting to a &#8216;Discovered&#8217; Social Problem Through Organisational Adaptation: Case Studies of Child Sexual Abuse Investigation of Seven New Zealand Police Districts</field><field name="creator">Burgering, Wendy Helen Miller</field><field name="description">Organisations operate in an environment buffeted by social change. Child sexual abuse became publicly recognised as a social problem from 1986. The first part of this thesis examines public awareness of, and interest in child sexual abuse, how child sexual abuse arose in New Zealand, the influence of international "moral entrepreneurs" in shaping this recognition and the activities of local "moral entrepreneurs"' including some police officers, in assisting the move of child sexual abuse from the private to the public arena. The second part of this thesis examines organisational change and whether the causes for organisational change are environmentally or managerially driven. Or is it, as this thesis suggests a combination of both. This thesis takes these theoretical arguments and applies them to the process of organisational change that occurred in the New Zealand Police Department, from the development and implementation of the National Abuse Policy for the investigation of child sexual abuse and serious physical abuse. The third part of this thesis examines the interlinking between the main theoretical foci, organisational change and the construction of a social problem. The results of an investigation from key staff, Police and other agency personnel, from seven New Zealand Police Department Districts, interviewed in three waves over a two and a half year period, are reported. The total number of key staff from each wave was 93, 80 and 68. The results of the first part of the thesis is that through effective lobbying by the women's movement and child protection groups child sexual abuse has become a recognised social problem. In the second part of the thesis the following were found to be crucial factors in the shaping of organisational responses to child sexual abuse: The role of middle managers in the implementation of organisational change policies in assigning or not assigning appropriate resources. The role of the top management in the ownership of organisational change policies the procedures. Continual staff turnover and the policy of staff rotation limited the successful implementation and continued support for the National Abuse Policy. This factor, staff turn over and/or rotation, will impact on the success of any organisational change policy. The extent of the training provisions for police officers at all levels within the organisation and the maintenance of that training at a national and district level. Acceptance of the multidisciplinary investigative approach which differed from more traditional policing approaches. The internal and external pressure on the Police to implement and maintain a high profile response in the child sexual abuse field. The results of the third part of the thesis is that the Police Department played a role in the public recognition of child sexual abuse as a social problem and as a result had to implement an operational response through the development of a National Abuse Policy.</field><field name="date">1994</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370100 Sociology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1963</field></doc><doc><field name="title">"Underconsumption" of Alcohol as a Form of Deviance &#8211; Minimum Drinking Norms in New Zealand Society and the Implications of their Production and Reproduction During Social Occasions</field><field name="creator">Paton-Simpson, Grant R.</field><field name="description">The deviance and alcohol literatures do not theorise expectations about minimum levels of alcohol consumption in any significant detail. Nor do they develop the notion that drinking less than is expected can be defined as a form of deviance. In response to this gap in the literature this thesis introduces and elaborates the concept of "underconsumption", defined briefly as the violation of minimum drinking norms. The thesis is also concerned to describe the key processes through which minimum drinking norms are produced and reproduced in social occasions' to demonstrate the public health significance of minimum drinking norms, and to provide evidence for the reality of "underconsumption" as a form of deviance in New Zealand society. Empirical research relied on face-to-face interviews, phone interviews, and postal surveys of 113 men - most of them abstainers or "light" drinkers. The main rationale was that likely violators of minimum drinking norms would be the most likely to have noticed and remembered the expression of minimum drinking norms. Transcripts and questionnaires were analysed with the assistance of qualitative database software. An important finding was that minimum drinking norms are in evidence throughout a broad cross-section of New Zealand society. It was also concluded that two of the main processes through which minimum drinking norms are produced and reproduced - people's reactions to abstention and lighter drinking styles and alcohol-centred hosting practices - continue to be in evidence. The relevant reactions and practices were also identified in a wide range of social groups. Furthermore, the case was presented that minimum drinking norms have potentially negative consequences for both individual "underdrinkers" and for societal levels of alcohol-related problems. These findings have important implications for the public health community and it is suggested that reference to a developed theory of "under-consumption" may have potential benefits for the planning of public health strategies and for public health policy. This research can also be seen to contribute to the alcohol literature, the deviance literature on alcohol, and the broader sociological literature on deviance. In the latter case, the analysis of "underconsumption" is most valuable by virtue of its status as "beneficial deviance".</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370100 Sociology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1964</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The synthesis and reactivity of new ruthenium and osmium silyl complexes</field><field name="creator">Salter, David Mark</field><field name="description">The chemistry of transition metal silyl complexes still remains relatively undeveloped despite the recent advances that have been made in this area. This thesis describes the synthesis and reactivity of new ruthenium and osmium silyl complexes. A general survey on the bonding, preparation and reactivity of transition metal silyl complexes is given in chapter one as an introduction to the chemistry discussed in the following chapters. Several reviews relating to transition metal-silicon chemistry have been published, 1-5 and therefore only the major features and more recent developments are highlighted in this overview. Emphasis has been placed on those aspects not previously reviewed. Coordinatively unsaturated transition metal silyl complexes are uncommon and the chemistry of these complexes has been virtually unexplored. The synthesis of the novel coordinatively unsaturated ruthenium and osmium silyl complexes, M(SiR3)Cl(CO)(PPh3)2 (M=Ru, Os; R=Cl, alkyl group, alkoxy group), is described in chapter two. The reaction of M(Ph)Cl(CO)(PPh3)2 (M=Ru, Os) with a silane, in some instances, provided a facile, high yield route to complexes of the type M(SiR3)Cl(CO)(PPh3)2 (M=Ru; SiR3=SiMe3, SiEt3, SiCl3, SiMe2Cl; M=Os; SiR3=SiCl3, SiMe2Cl). The chlorosily1 complexes were also prepared by treatment of MHCl(CO)(PPh3)3 (M=Ru, Os) with HSiCl3 and HSiMe2Cl. X-ray crystal structures were obtained of Ru(SiEt3)Cl(CO)(PPh3)2 and Os(SiCl3)Cl(CO)(PPh3)2. Complexes containing chlorosily1 ligands proved synthetically useful, undergoing a variety of nucleophilic substitution reactions at silicon with retention of the transition metal-silicon bond. New complexes synthesized by this method included Ru[Si(OEt)3]Cl(CO)(PPh3)2 and Os(SiMe3)Cl(CO)(PPh3)2. X-ray crystal structures of these two compounds were also obtained. These exchange reactions illustrate a route to new transition metal silyl compounds that has rarely been utilised. Also described in chapter two is the unprecedented formation of the novel compound Os(SiMe2C6H4PPh2)(C6H4PPh2)(CO)(PPh3), resulting from phenylation at silicon. The structure of this complex was determined by X-ray crystallography. In chapter three, addition of the Lewis bases CO and CN(p-tolyl) to coordinatively unsaturated silyl complexes, M(SiR3)Cl(CO)(PPh3)2 (M=Ru, Os), is described. The coordinatively saturated osmium silyl complexes Os(SiR3)Cl(CO)L(PPh3)2 (SiR3=SiCl3, SiMe2Cl, SiMe2OEt, SiMe3; L=CO, CNR) were generated in this way. Similarly, addition of 4,4'-dimethyl-2,2'-bipyridine to Ru(SiEt3)Cl(CO)(PPh3)2 afforded Ru(siEt3)Cl(dimethylbipy)(CO)(PPh3). The six-coordinate complex Ru(SiEt3)(&#951;2-S2CNMe2)(CO)(PPh3)2 was synthesized by displacement of the labile chloride ligand from Ru(SiEt3)Cl(CO)(PPh3)2 by the dimethyldithiocarbamate anion. Characterization of Ru(SiEt3)(&#951;2-S2CNMe2)(CO)(PPh3)2 included an X-ray crystallographic analysis. The exchange of silyl groups at the metal was also observed in several reactions. For example, heating Ru(SiMe3)Cl(CO)(PPh3)2 in the presence of excess HSiEt3 yielded Ru(SiEt3)Cl(CO)(PPh3)2. These reactions illustrate aspects of the chemistry that can occur at the metal centre of coordinatively unsaturated transition metal silyl complexes. Another route to coordinatively saturated osmium silyl complexes was via oxidative addition of a silane to Os(CO)2(PPh3)3, which yielded Os(SiR3)H(CO)2(PPh3)2 (SiR3=SiMe3, SiEt3, SiPh3, SiPh2H). The synthesis of these complexes is also discussed in chapter three. An X-ray crystal structure determination of Os(SiEt3)H(CO)2(PPh3)2 confirmed the presence of mutually trans carbonyl ligands. The first thiocarbonyl-containing transition metal silyl complexes, M(SiMe2Cl)Cl(CS)(PPh3)2 (M=Ru, Os), were prepared by treating M(Ph)Cl(CS)(PPh3)2 or MHCl(CS)(PPh3)3 with HSiMe2Cl. The Si-Cl bond in these compounds reacted readily with nucleophiles, yielding M(SiMe2OR)Cl(CS)(PPh3)2 (OR=OEt, OMe, OH). In contrast to the addition of CO to Os(SiR3)Cl(CO)(PPh3)2, addition of CO to Ru(SiMe2R)Cl(CS)(PPh3)2 (R=Cl, OEt, OMe, OH) and to Os(SiMe2OEt)Cl(CS)(PPh3)2 afforded dihapto-thioacyl complexes, M[&#951;2-C(S)SiMe2R]Cl(CO)(PPh3)2, via a migratory insertion reaction involving the silyl group and the thiocarbonyl ligand. This reaction represents the first formal insertion of CS into a transition metal-silicon bond. The structure of Ru[&#951;2-C(S)SiMe2OEt]Cl(CO)(PPh3)2 was obtained by X-ray crystallography and confirmed that bonding of the thioacyl ligand occurred in a dihapto fashion. These reactions are described in chapter four. When Os(Ph)Cl(CO)(PPh3)2 was reacted with HSiMe3, the formally osmium(IV) silyl complex Os(SiMe3)H3(CO)(PPh3)2 was produced. Few compounds of this type are known. The synthesis, characterization and reactivity of Os(SiMe3)H3(CO)(PPh3)2 are discussed in chapter five. The crystal structure of Os(SiMe3)H3(CO)(PPh3)2 is also depicted. In solution, Os(SiMe3)H3(CO)(PPh3)2 appeared to be in equilibrium with the highly reactive, coordinatively unsaturated species OsH2(CO)(PPh3)2. The reaction of Os(SiMe3)H3(CO)(PPh3)2 with HSiR3 (R=Et, Ph), HSn(p-tolyl)3 and HC2Ph was carried out, using Os(SiMe3)H3(CO)(PPh3)2 as an in situ source of OsH2(CO)(PPh3)2. These reactions afforded Os(SiR3)H3(CO)(PPh3)2 (R=Et, Ph), Os[Sn(p-tolyl)3]2H2(CO)(PPh3)2 and OsH(C2Ph)(CO)(PPh3)3 respectively, most likely via a series of oxidative addition-reductive elimination reactions involving OsH2(CO)(PPh3)2. Transition metal hydroxysilyl complexes are extremely rare. Only three systems have been reported containing a hydroxysilyl group bonded to a transition metal. 6,7,8 Chapter six deals with the formation of compounds of this type. Hydroxysilyl-containing complexes of ruthenium and osmium were obtained via the hydrolysis of M(SiMe2Cl)Cl(CO)(PPh3)2 and M(SiCl3)Cl(CO)(PPh3)2. The complexes M[Si(OH)3]Cl(CO)(PPh3)2 are the first trihydroxysilyl-containing transition metal complexes and therefore represent a new class of transition metal silyl compounds. Characterization of Os[Si(OH)3]Cl(CO)(PPh3)2 included an X-ray crystal structure which showed that, remarkably, no inter- or intra-molecular hydrogen bonding of the type O(H)&#183;&#183;&#183;O or O(H) &#183;&#183;Cl was associated with the Si(OH)3 group. In contrast, intermolecular hydrogen bonding was found by X-ray crystallography for the dicarbonyl derivative, Os[Si(OH)3]Cl(CO)2(PPh3)2. Subsequent reactions involving Os[Si(OH)3]Cl(CO)(PPh3)2 led to the synthesis of the diosmium tetrahydroxydisiloxane complex, [OsCl(CO)(PPh3)2Si(OH)2-]2O. For example, [OsCl(CO)(PPh3)2Si(OH)2-]2O was isolated after Os(SiCl3)Cl(CO)(PPh3)2 was added to a dichloromethane solution of Os[Si(OH)3]Cl(CO)(PPh3)2. Formation of this tetrahydroxydisiloxane compound is significant and models the first condensation reaction generating a Si-O-Si linkage in the hydrolysis of organochlorosilanes to polysiloxanes. The Si-O-Si linkage was clearly visible in the X-ray crystal structure of [OsCl(CO)(PPh3)2Si(OH)2-]2O.

The simplest form of this interaction is the electric dipole interaction, and in its quantised form it provides a useful starting point for the investigation of quantum effects in optics. Two examples of quantum noise manipulation of the light field due to interaction with atoms will be presented, as well as an analysis of a simple model for laser cooling of trapped atoms. The first example of quantum noise manipulation is the investigation of a quantum non-demolition measurement scheme based on a three-level atomic system in the ladder configuration. An effective two-level model of the atomic system is used, which enables the inclusion of spontaneous emission noise from the upper atomic level. The system is found to perform well, when detuned far from resonance. The second example is the treatment of squeezing in the intensity difference between two modes coupled by a three-level atomic system in the ladder configuration. The noise correlations are similar to those occurring in the optical parametric oscillator, and give rise to good squeezing when the system is well detuned from the intermediate level. The simple model of laser cooling consists of a single two-level atom with quantised centre-of-mass motion constrained to move in a one-dimensional harmonic potential while interacting with a single-mode classical travelling light field. It is shown that there is an analogy between this model and the Jaynes-Cummings model. This gives rise to interesting coherent effects including quantum collapses and revivals in the atomic inversion. Sideband cooling occurs for this model when the light field is tuned to the atom's first lower vibrational sideband. The strong sideband and Lamb-Dicke perturbation regimes are defined. Analytic results have previously been obtained for the latter regime, but we carry out a numerical investigation of the steady state and time evolution behaviour in the former regime. Differences in the behaviour in the two regimes are discussed. Finally the possibility of observing quantum jumps between trap levels is discussed.</field><field name="date">1993</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::240000 Physical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1966</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The molecular response of wheat roots to aluminium stress</field><field name="creator">Snowden, Kimberley Cathryn</field><field name="description">Aluminium (Al) toxicity to plants is a significant problem, limiting agricultural production in up to 40% of the world's arable soils. In spite of a large amount of research, there is still no consensus on the physiological mechanisms of Al toxicity in plants. In addition, very little is known about the molecular response of plants to Al stress. This body of research was aimed at identifying the changes in gene expression that occurred in the root tips of plants that had been stressed with Al. A cDNA library made from the root tips of Al-treated wheat (Triticum aestivum L., cultivar Warigal) plants was differentially screened to identify clones whose expression was induced by Al stress. Seven cDNA clones, representing five different genes were identified as being induced in the presence of Al. Initial sequencing and northern analysis revealed that none of the clones isolated were full-length, and that some contained multiple cloning adaptors at their 5' ends. A new cDNA library was then constructed from the root tips of Al-treated Warigal plants, and homologues to each of the original five genes were isolated. These five clones were named wali1 to wali5 (for wheat aluminium induced). Northern analysis showed that wali1, -3 and -5 were induced 24 to 96 h after Al treatment, and their expression declined when the Al was removed. wali4 had a similar pattern of expression with a transient increase in expression also observed after 0.5 h of Al stress. Each of these four genes was induced by inhibitory concentrations of Al in two wheat cultivars - Warigal, an Al-sensitive cultivar, and Waalt, an Al-tolerant cultivar, - and also in two inbred lines of wheat, RR (Al-tolerant) and SS (Al-sensitive). The fifth gene (wali2) had a bimodal pattern of induction, and was induced by Al only in the Al-sensitive Warigal and the Al-tolerant RR. The nucleotide sequence of each of the wali clones was determined, and the databases were searched for homologous sequences. Wali1 was found to be homologous to a group of metallothionein-like proteins (MLPs) from plants, and wali4 was homologous to phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL). wali3 and wali5 encode related, cysteine-rich proteins with homology to Bowman-Birk proteinase inhibitors, and wali2 encodes a novel protein with a repeating motif of cysteine amino acids. The induction of the wali genes was investigated in response to a number of other stresses through northern analysis. The expression of wali1, -3, -4 and -5 was induced in root tips of wheat after 2 d treatments with toxic levels of all other metals tested (Cd, Fe, Zn, Cu, Ga, In and La). The expression levels of wali1, -3, -4, and -5 also increased in the root tips of plants grown in the presence of low levels of Ca (10&#956;M). The transcript levels of wali1, -3 and -5 increased in wounded leaf and root tissue, whereas the transcript levels of wali4 increased only in wounded leaves. The expression of wali2 was greatly reduced by low concentrations of Ca, and showed no induction, or a variable response with most of the other treatments. The site of expression of wali1, -2, -3 and -5 in root tips (and wali1 also in leaf tissue) was identified using in situ hybridisation. Wali1 was expressed predominantly in the meristematic tissue of the root tip, while wali3 and wali5 were expressed predominantly in the cortical tissue of the root. wali2 expression was detected primarily in the epidermis and root cap. Some changes in the site of expression of these genes were evident in the roots of Al-treated plants. In leaf tissue, wali1 expression was found in the mesophyl1 layer of cells. The coding sequences for wali1,-2,-3 and -5 were each cloned into the bacterial expression vector pGEX-2T. The resultant fusion proteins between glutathione S-transferase (GST) and the walis were then successfully purified from E coli. Antibodies were made to the wali1-GST fusion protein and purified by immunoaffinity chromatography. However, when used in western analysis, no specific bands corresponding to the native wali1 protein were identified. The wali2-GST protein was used in a south-western procedure to determine if the protein was capable of binding DNA, but no DNA binding to this protein was detected under the conditions tested. The wali3 and wali5 fusion proteins were tested in proteinase inhibitor assays, where no inhibition of either trypsin or chymotrypsin was detected. It is possible that the native wali3 and wali5 proteins may not function as proteinase inhibitors, or that the lack of activity detected for the fusion proteins may be due to incorrect folding or processing in the bacterial system. This research constitutes the first identification of plant genes whose expression is increased by Al stress. The genes identified are also induced in response to other environmental and nutrient stresses, indicating that they form part of the plant's general response to stress.</field><field name="date">1994</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270100 Biochemistry and Cell Biology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1967</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Midwifery and maternity services in transition: An Examination of change following The Nurses Amendment Act 1990</field><field name="creator">Abel, Sally</field><field name="description">The Nurses Amendment Act 1990 enabled midwives in New Zealand/Aotearoa to care for women throughout normal childbirth on their own responsibility, without the supervision of a medical practitioner, as had previously been the case. The Act brought about significant changes to midwives' scope of practice, pay and status which had important implications for women's care, midwifery, the relationship between midwifery and medicine and the structure of maternity services. Three years after the passage of the Act, in July 1993, major restructuring of the health system along market principles began. From this time, consultation began for new maternity services arrangements, which fitted within the philosophy and structure of the new health system and which aimed to rectify some of the perceived problems resulting from the initial implementation of the 1990 Act. The consultation process was to take three years. This thesis describes and critically analyses changes to midwifery and maternity services, particularly in the greater Auckland region, in the six years from the passage of the Nurses Amendment Act in August 1990 until the official introduction of the new maternity structure in July 1996. This was a period in which midwifery was establishing itself in a medically-dominated domain while, simultaneously, a significant ideological shift was occurring in the philosophy and structure of the health system. Using an ethnographic approach, which included extensive key informant interviews and participant observation at a range of meetings over a period of three years I investigated in depth both the process of change and the relations of power between interest groups (consumer representatives, midwifery, medicine, hospital managers and regional health authorities) within local and national maternity services arenas. These findings were analysed using Foucault's later work on power and his concept of governmentality. A range of factors, including some of the trends occurring within the public sector, weakened the medical profession's control of normal childbirth and facilitated midwifery's entry as a competing provider of maternity care. Strategies used by midwifery representatives to maintain and develop the occupation's autonomous status were often effective, albeit constantly challenged. Despite ongoing conflict and some polarisation between medicine and midwifery, in general, relations of power between the various interest groups in both local and national settings were found to be complex and contestable with unstable alliances forming around particular issues. However, the fluidity of these power relations and the gains made by midwifery operated within constraints imposed by the influence of neo-liberal policies on the development of the new maternity structure. This gave the government's agents, the regional health authorities, the controlling influence on maternity services policy. Although the professed aim of the new structure was a more women-centred service, there were limits to consumer influence on maternity services policy and fiscal imperatives took precedence over some consumer interests.

Because of the pesticide regulations in some of the countries to which New Zealand exports fruit, total protection from Botrytis stem end rot with current dicarboximide fungicides is not possible. The aim of this thesis was to investigate biological control measures for Botrytis stem end rot and Sclerotinia diseases of kiwifruit. More than 1000 microorganisms, isolated from the leaves and flowers of kiwifruit during spring and autumn, and selected from BCAs reported to be effective against B. cinerea and./or S. sclerotiorum, were tested in vitro for their antagonistic ability against B. cinerea and S. sclerotiorum. Successful antagonists were those that, in dual culture on agar plates, produced a zone of inhibition, an area of browning of the pathogens, or grew rapidly over the pathogens and inhibited their growth. The fifty most promising isolates from the initial screen were tested on fruit for their ability to reduce Botrytis and Sclerotinia fruit rots. Mature kiwifruit were artificallv wounded and dual inoculated with a spore suspension of one of the fifty test organisms and either a conidial suspension of B. cinerea or a mycelial suspension of S. sclerotiorum. Following 8-12 weeks incubation in a cool store, fruit were assessed for Botrytis or Sclerotinia induced rot. Isolates of Bacillus spp., Epicoccum purpurascens, Pseudomonas sp. and Trichoderma. spp. reduced, Botrytis fruit rot from 92% (inoculated control) to 0%.Isolates of Alternaria spp., pestalotia sp. and a non-sporulating isolate also reduced the number of fruit rotting to some extent. Similarly, isolates of Bacillus spp., E purpurascens and Trichoderma spp. reduce d Sclerotinia fruit rot from 100% (inoculated control) to 0%. Isolates of Alternaria spp., Myrothecium verrucaria and Pestalotia sp. were also successful at reducing the level of Sclerotinia fruit rot. It was considered undesirable if potential biological control agents (BCAs) were able to colonize kiwifruit that were to be marketed for human consumption. In order to determine if microorganisms, shown to be effective in preventing Botrytis or Sclerotinia fruit rot, were capable of themselves colonizing fruit, isolations were made from fruit dual inoculated with B. cinerea, S. sclerotiorum and/or one of several BCAs. Strains of the BCAs Bacillus spp., Pseudomonas sp. and E. purpurascens were not found to be saprophytic on fruit. Isolates of Alternaria sp., Bacillus sp., E purpurascens, pestalotia sp., Pseudomonas sp. and T. harzianum significantly inhibited germination and germ tube elongation of B. cinerea conidia in vitro in a nutrient solution, over a 24 h period. For example, the presence of Alternaria alternata A6 spores in a nutrient solution reduced germination of B. cinerea conidia from 100% to 20%. The presence of E purpurascens A77 spores inhibited B. cinerea conidial germ tube elongation from &gt;840 pm (in control conidia) to 27 &#181;m. The presence of any one of the BCAs tested prevented germination of B. cinerea conidia in a non-nutrient water solution, in comparision to germination of up to 86% in controls. A spore or cell suspension of each of the isolates Bacillus sp.M60, E. purpurascens A77 and T. harzianum C65 were spray inoculated onto kiwifruit blossoms produced in vivo in the glasshouse, immediately prior to inoculation of the blossoms with a condial suspension of B. cinerea. Application of the BCAs were completely effective in preventing colonization of blossoms by B- cinerea conidia. The effectiveness of each of the isolates E. purpurascens A77,T. harzianum C65 and either Bacillus sp.M60 or M53 to reduce the viability of sclerotia of B. cinerea and S. sclerotiorum was tested in soil punnets. A spore or cell suspension of each respective BCA was applied to the surface of replicated punnets that were seeded with either B. cinerea or S. sclerotiorum. Following 8 weeks incubation, punnets were harvested and viability of sclerotia assessed. T. harzianum C65 and Bacillus sp. M60 significantly reduced the viability of B. cinerea sclerotia from 8 sclerotia/punnet (control) to 4 sclerotia/punnet. T. harzianum C65 and E. purpurascens A77 caused a significant reduction in apothecia production of S. sclerotiorum, from 2.7 apothecia/punnet (control) to 0.7 apothecia/punnet. Bacillus sp.M8 and E purpurascens A77 were tested for their ability to reduce Botrytis stem end rot and Sclerotinia field rot in a kiwifruit orchard. The isolates tested did not successfully reduce either disease. Possible explanations for this are discussed. In order to monitor the survival of particular isolates of BCAs in the field, a technique was developed to distinguish between individual strains of a BCA species. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was utilized to identify DNA polymorphisms within the genome of T. harzianum C65, in comparison with other strains of Trichoderma spp.. A sequence of polymorphic DNA was cloned, sequenced and used as a hybridization probe in southern blotting to enable T. harzianum c65 to be distinguished from other strains of Trichoderma spp.. From the results obtained in this study, it was considered that Bacillus M60, E purpurascens 477 and Pseudomonas M30 were the best isolates for the biological control of Botrytis stem end rot on kiwifruit. Further work to enable application of these isolates as postharvest BCAs is discussed. Of the isolates tested in this study, T. harzianum C65 was considered the best isolate for use against Sclerotinia diseases on kiwifruit. Methods of selecting more effective BCAs against S. sclerotiorum are discussed.</field><field name="date">1993</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270400 Botany::270403 Plant pathology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1971</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Constructing a woman: gender, genre, and subjectivity in the autobiographical works of Sibilla Aleramo</field><field name="creator">Jacobs, Susan (Susan Mary)</field><field name="description">Both Sibilla Aleramo (1876-1960), one of Italy's most renowned and controversial women writers, and autobiography, as a generic minefield for debates on theories of the subject, have received a good deal of critical attention over the past fifteen years. The uncompromisingly autobiographical nature of Sibilla's work has been, at various times, revered and reviled, be it for what she says, or how she says it. My focus is precisely on the different forms she uses to write her self in four texts - a fictional autobiography, lyrical novel, epistolary novel and a diary - and how these construct, modify and deconstruct her self-representations in a continual process of intertextual reading and revising. Yet her texts resist easy classification. While sometimes confirming boundaries of genre and gender, they also constantly call them into question by exposing their limits, their intersection with fictional norms, and their shifting discursive affiliations. Because Sibilla was all her life concerned with gender, and the relationship of femininity to her writing, many aspects of her work appear relevant today. I explore how they anticipate feminist theories on the construction of female subjectivity in a combination of theory and autobiographical practice which highlights the interrelationship of the two. Here Sibilla's focus on the maternal is particularly indicative of this tendency, where it is woven into the generic structures of her texts as well as being an important focus of the autobiographical "story". Furthermore, her texts challenge the notion of self defined by male bias, and present opportunities for critical testing of autobiographical theories themselves by offering not one, but several, works for examination.</field><field name="date">1994</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::379900 Other Studies In Human Society::379901 Gender specific studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1972</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Analysis of binary data in quantitative plant ecology</field><field name="creator">Yee, Thomas William</field><field name="description">The analysis of presence/absence data of plant species by regression analysis is the subject of this thesis.

Parametric models are used to estimate optimal conditions for the presence of species and to test several niche theory hypotheses. An extension of GAMs called vector GAMs is proposed, and they provide a means for proposing nonparametric versions of the following models: multivariate regression, the proportional and nonproportional odds model, the multiple logistic regression model, and bivariate binary regression models such as bivariate probit model and the bivariate logistic model. Some theoretical properties of vector GAMs are deduced from those pertaining to ordinary GAMs, and its relationship with the generalized estimating equations (GEE) approach elucidated.</field><field name="date">1993</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::230000 Mathematical Sciences::230200 Statistics</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270400 Botany</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1973</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reading readings: some current critical debates about New Zealand literature and culture</field><field name="creator">Paul, Mary</field><field name="description">This thesis examines contemporary interpretations of a selection of important texts written by New Zealand women between 1910 and 1940, and also a film and film script written more recently (which are considered as re-readings of a novel by Mander). The thesis argues that, though reading or meaning-making is always an activity of construction there will, at any given moment, always be reasons for preferring one way of reading over another-a reading most appropriate to a situation or circumstances. This study is motivated by a desire to understand how literary criticism has changed in recent years, particularly under the influence of feminism, and how a reader today can make a choice among competing methods of interpretation. Comparisons are drawn between various possible readings of the texts in order to classify methods of reading, particularly nationalist and feminist reading strategies. The over-all tendency of the argument is to propose a more self-critical and self-conscious approach to reading, and to develop a materialist and historical approach which I see as particularly important to the New Zealand context in the 1990s.</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420200 Literature Studies::420201 New Zealand literature in English</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1974</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Further insight into the Lewis histo-blood-group system as revealed from study of Polynesian and Caucasian plasma and erythrocyte glycosphingolipids</field><field name="creator">Henry, Stephen Michael</field><field name="description">This project involved the study of Lewis and related blood group glycosphingolipid isolated from individuals with normal and aberrant Lewis/secretor phenotypes. The objective was to find a biochemical basis for the unusual expression of Lewis and secretor phenotypes in Polynesians and to use this information to shed light on the "normal" expression of Lewis antigens. By using purified glycolipids, presenting them in the cell free environment of thin layer chromatography to Lewis antibodies and by determining structures by mass spectrometry it has been shown that: l. The Lec epitope is a terminal Gal&#946;1-3Gal sequence, and not an internal branch as proposed by Hanfland (Hanfland et a1.,1986). 2. Lec or H-5-1 are present in Lewis negative phenotypes and their consequent consumption by the Le and ,Se transferases resulting in the known Lea and Leb antigens can be seen in the Lewis positives. 3. Phenotypically Le(a-b-) individuals have small amounts of Lewis antigens. This clearly demonstrates that although the Lewis negative phenotype exists at the crude serological level, this phenotype is not an "all-or-nothing" phenomenon at the chemical level. This also allows it to be postulated that the le gene is probably partially active. 4. Le(a+b+) individuals have both Lea and Leb glycolipids in the erythrocyte membrane and in plasma. Observed phenotyping anomalies appear to be related to there being quantitatively less Leb-6 in the Polynesian Le(a+b+) erythrocyte membrane than in the Le(a-b+) membrane. 5. The Le(a+b-) phenotype of Polynesians is actually the Le(a+b+) phenotype but with serologically undetectable Leb. This allows it to be postulated that the nonsecretor gene (se) is absent in Polynesians. 6. Extended structures are present in most of the Polynesian samples which is in support of a postulated weak secretor gene (Sew). It now appears that the difference between the extended Lewis glycolipids of Caucasians and Polynesians is quantitative. The postulated, Sew transferase appears to be inefficient and allows for increased formation of elongated glycoconjugates (polyglycosylceramides) to result. 7. Reduced fucosyltransferase activity allows increased elongation of the precursor chain to occur, which allows it to be postulated that fucosylation of the precursor prevents, or at least markedly reduces, chain elongation. It is speculated that, as almost everyone is either Lewis and/or secretor positive, perhaps the prevention of chain elongation is a biological reason as to why the Lewis and Secretor polymorphisms exist. 8. Differences in ceramide patterns of Lewis active glycolipids suggests that the small intestinal tract is not the only origin of plasma glycolipids, or there is differential absorption. 9. There is no plasma glycolipid-based reason for there being increased H type 2 antigen reactivity in the Polynesian erythrocyte membrane, nor a reason for the H antigen association with the Le(a+b+) phenotype.</field><field name="date">1993</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270100 Biochemistry and Cell Biology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1975</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Population dynamics of juvenile snapper (Pagrus auratus) in the Hauraki Gulf</field><field name="creator">Francis, Malcolm, 1954-</field><field name="description">The population dynamics of juvenile snapper, Pagrus auratus, were investigated in the Hauraki Gulf, north-eastern New Zealand, between 1982 and 1990. Attention focused on age and growth, temporal and spatial variation in abundance, and recruitment. Daily increment formation was validated in the sagittae of snapper up to about 160 days old. Increment width varied with time of year, and snapper age, and increments were not resolvable with a light microscope during winter. Increment counts inside a prominent metamorphic mark showed that larval duration was 18-32 days, and was inversely related to water temperature. Spawning dates were back-calculated from increment counts in settled juveniles, and ranged from September to March with a peak in November-January. The onset of spawning was temperature dependent. Fast-growing snapper had smaller sagittae than slow-growing snapper, indicating an uncoupling of otolith and somatic growth. Snapper gonads differentiated first as ovaries during the second year of life, and then some juveniles changed sex to become males during their third year. Sex change occurred before maturity, so snapper are functionally gonochoristic. Growth was slow during the larval phase, but increased rapidly after metamorphosis to about 0.6-0.9 mm.day-1. From the first winter, growth followed a well-defined annual cycle, with little or no growth during winter, and linear growth of 0.16-0.43 mm.day-1 during spring-autumn for 0+/1+ and 1+/2+ snapper. Snapper grew faster at higher temperatures. Trawl catch rates were affected by numerous gear and environmental factors, but probably provided reasonable estimates of snapper relative abundance. Recommendations are made for improving snapper trawl survey procedures. There was a strong annual abundance cycle in the Kawau region, peaking in spring, and declining to a minimum in winter. Snapper were patchily distributed at a spatial scale of 1-2 km, probably because of preference for specific micro-habitats. Year class strength of 1+ snapper varied 17-fold over seven years, and was strongly positively correlated with autumn sea surface temperature during the 0+ year. The strengths of the 1991 and 1992 year classes are predicted to be below average, and extremely weak, respectively.</field><field name="date">1992</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270500 Zoology</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270700 Ecology and Evolution::270702 Marine and estuarine ecology (incl. marine ichthyology)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1976</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reductively triggered internal cyclisation reactions</field><field name="creator">Sykes, Bridget Maree</field><field name="description">Reductively triggered internal cyclisation reactions have been investigated as a prodrug system for the hypoxia selective release of aromatic nitrogen mustards. The observed pseudo-first-order rate coefficients of cyclisation of several model 2-aminoaryl-acetamides and propanamides have been measured. Cyclisation was observed to be strongly influenced by stereochemistry, whereas electron withdrawal from the amine-bearing ring resulted in a comparatively modest slowing of the rate of cyclisation. Protonation of the leaving group appeared to increase the rate of cyclisation, while changes in 4-substitution on the leaving amine had little effect on this rate. The cyclisation of 2-(2-aminophenyl) alkanamides was found to be subject to general catalysis by acidic buffer components, and rate determining formation of the tetrahedral intermediate has been proposed. Ring closure reactions of several 2-hydroxylaminophenylalkanamides have been studied by &#947;-radiolysis. HPLC methods have been developed for the separation of reduction and cyclisation products. Reduction stoichiometry implicates the hydroxylamine as the predominant reduction product of radiolysis of the 2-nitrophenylalkanamide precursors, which varied in the nature of substitution of the nitrobenzyl ring, 4-substitution of the leaving aniline, and overall geometry. Cyclisation via the hydroxylamino was observed to be significantly faster than that of its amino counterparts, and was similarly influenced by changes in geometry. The hydroxylamine undergoes a base catalysed, oxygen dependent reaction under aerobic conditions. This reaction did not appear to be influenced by the geometry of the compound. Substitution of the hydroxylamine-bearing ring with a carboxamide group (CONHR &#963;p = 0.36) lowered the pH at which hydroxylamino-amide cyclisation was slowest, compared with its unsubstituted counterpart. The reaction was found to be aided by electron-withdrawal from the leaving amine. Rate determining breakdown of the tetrahedral intermediate has been proposed. Preliminary investigations have been made on 2-nitrophenyl alkyl esters and a 2,6-dinitrophenylamide prodrug system. Rapid, reductively triggered release of coupled phenols and amines has been observed from the nitro-esters and -amides, respectively. In contrast to amino-amide and hydroxylamino-amide cyclisation, gem-dimethyl substitution did not facilitate reductive release from the nitro-ester. The inability to measure the rates of reductive release in radiolysis solutions suggests that these reactions occur significantly faster than hydroxylamino-amide ring closure. Molecular mechanics calculations have been undertaken to investigate relationships between the geometry of 2-aminoarylalkanamides, and rates of cyclisation. The distance between, and angle of approach of the nucleophilic and electrophilic centres in the calculated minimum-energy conformer did not display a correlation with cyclisation rates.</field><field name="date">1994</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1977</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Multiple textual and graphical views for interactive software development environments</field><field name="creator">Grundy, John (John Collis)</field><field name="description">Diagram construction can be used to visually analyse and design a complex software system using natural, graphical representations describing high-level structure and semantics. Textual programming can specify detailed documentation and functionality not well expressed at a visual level. Integrating multiple textual and graphical views of software development allows programmers to utilise both representations as appropriate. Consistency management between these views must be automatically maintained by the development environment. MViews, a model for such software development environments, has been developed. MViews supports integrated textual and graphical views of software development with consistency management. MViews provides flexible program and view representation using a novel object dependency graph approach. Multiple views of a program may contain common information and are stored as graphs with textual or graphical renderings and editing. Change propagation between program components and views is supported using a novel update record mechanism. Different editing tools are integrated as views of a common program repository and new program representations and editors can be integrated without affecting existing views. A specification language for program and view state and manipulation semantics, and a visual specification language for view appearance and editing semantics, have been developed. An object-oriented architecture based on MViews abstractions allows environment specifications to be translated into a design for implementing environments. Environment designs are implemented by specialising a framework of object-oriented language classes based on the MViews architecture. A new language is described which provides object-oriented extensions to Prolog. An integrated software development environment for this language is discussed and the specification, design and implementation of this environment using MViews are described.

G. (John G.)</field><field name="description">A field system capable of making high-resolution measurements of rainfall is described. The system incorporates a disdrometer, an array of high-resolution raingauges, a general-purpose data acquisition system and ancillary equipment. In an evaluation of the disdrometer, a theory allowing calculation of the effects of windspeed on detection efficiency is presented which has wide applicability. The raingauges are an improved design allowing 10-s temporal resolution of rainfall intensity and 100 m spatial resolution of rain-patch size when used in the array. An extensive data base of measurements made using the field system is described. Duration of rainfall is shown to be approximately log-normal and is consistent with a log-normal distribution of precipitation region size. The fractional duration of rainfall above a threshold intensity varies considerably between rain periods, a result which may be important for electromagnetic attenuation models. Estimation of the shapes of rain patches using the raingauge array is demonstrated and shows considerable promise. Raindrop fallspeeds, measured using the disdrometer, generally show much less deviation from stagnant air terminal velocities than indicated by previously reported results. Much of the spread in the results is shown to be consistent with instrumentation errors although significant residual deviations are still apparent; the fallspeeds are generally slower than stagnant air values would suggest. Measurements of the arrival rate of raindrops at the disdrometer indicate clustering of drops rather than the often assumed Poisson distribution. The clustering is associated with small drops and has reasonable correlation with rainfall intensity. Examination of the cross-correlation of arrival rates of different sized drops show results in contradiction to previous results; small drops are found to lead other sized drops. Using a normalisation method, the shapes of raindrop size distributions measured are shown to be depressed in the mid-radius region.</field><field name="date">1984</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::240000 Physical Sciences::240500 Classical Physics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1979</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies on the Oxidation of Aromatic Steroids</field><field name="creator">Manning, Terence David Ross</field><field name="description">This thesis is concerned primarily with a study of the oxidation of aromatic steroids employing either chromium trioxide-aqueous acetic acid or chromium trioxide-aqueous sulphuric acid-acetone mixtures. The nature of the chromic acid oxidation of various functional groups is discussed first and this is followed by an outline of the two methods used for the synthesis of the aromatic steroids which were oxidised in this study. The second part of the discussion deals with the oxidation of these aromatic steroids. It was found that chromic acid oxidation of ring-A aromatic steroids containing a strong electron-donating C3-substituent, such as methoxyl, gave the corresponding 9-hydroxy-11-oxo derivative (ketol). However, a ketol was not formed if a C3-methoxyl substituted ring-A aromatic steroid also contained a substituent at C1. When a C3-methoxyl substituent was present, the 6-oxo-ring-A aromatic steroid was a minor oxidation product but such compounds were the major products from the chromic acid oxidation of ring-A aromatic steroids containing a weak C3-electron-donating group, such as acetoxyl. The oxidation of a ring-A aromatic steroid containing a C2-methoxyl substituent gave an almost quantitative yield of the corresponding 6-oxo compound. Suzuki103 has claimed that the major oxidation product of 17&#946;-acetoxy-3-methoxyestra-1,3,5(10)-triene (34b) is 17 &#946;-acetoxy-9&#945;- hydroxy-3-methoxyestra-1,3,5(10)-trien-11-one (123). Physical and chemical evidence are presented to show that this product is in fact the 9&#946;-hydroxy epimer and a reaction pathway for its formation is proposed. An examination of the oxidation products of a ring-B aromatic steroid and a ring-C aromatic steroid shows that no ketols were formed.</field><field name="date">1968</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1981</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Lepidopterous pests on vegetable brassicas in Pukekohe, New Zealand: their seasonality, parasitism, and management</field><field name="creator">Beck, Nancy Gunther</field><field name="description">The vegetable brassicas of cabbage, broccoli, and cauliflower are grown in Pukekohe for the Auckland fresh-produce markets. These brassicas are attacked by three major lepidopterous pests: diamondback moth (DBM) (Plutella xylostella (L)) (Yponomeutidae), white butterfly (WB) (Pieris rapae (L.)) (Pieridae), and soybean looper (SBL) (Thysanoplusia orichalcea (F.)) (Noctuidae). Current grower strategy to combat these pests is calendar-scheduled insecticide applications. The goal of this thesis is to develop pest management alternatives. The seasonality of these three pests is discussed. DBM and WB are each under biological control by a larval and a pupal parasitoid, but this natural control is not sufficient to allow economic harvests in cabbage and was not synchronized. No parasitoids of SBL were found. The importation of additional natural enemies is discussed. A scouting system of the percent of cabbage plants infested coupled with an action threshold of. 15%-20% infested plants, resulted in good yields in field trials and allowed up to a 50% reduction in insecticide applications over the growth period when compared to a 14-day calendar schedule. Implementation of the 15% infested threshold in commercial cabbage fields resulted in up to an 83% reduction in insecticide applications with no yield decrease in quality or quantity. Application of this 15% infested plant threshold to broccoli and cauliflower decreased insecticide applications by 40% and 17%, respectively. Study of larval biology indicated that all of the lepidopterans preferentially fed on leaves; timing of the first insecticide application in broccoli and cauliflower to coincide with floret initiation decreased insecticide applications by 80% and 67%, respectively. Laboratory and field trials comparing DBM oviposition preference, larval survivability, and parasitism rates between cabbage, broccoli, and cauliflower are discussed. Knowledge of lepidopterous pest seasonality and biology, linked to careful timing of insecticide applications to coincide with threshold levels of pests, can take full advantage of natural enemies and reduce insecticide input in the vegetable brassicas of cabbage, broccoli, and cauliflower with no decrease in crop quality.</field><field name="date">1991</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270500 Zoology::270505 Entomology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1982</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Picosecond Pulse Generation and Propagation in Erbium Doped Optical Fibres</field><field name="creator">Bollond, Paul</field><field name="description">This thesis is concerned with the generation of picosecond pulses and their propagation through both resonant and non-resonant media. This was achieved by constructing a passively modelocked Erbium doped fibre laser (EDFL) which was used to study pulse propagation through sections of standard communications grade optical fibre, dispersion shifted optical fibre, and also through an Erbium doped fibre amplifier (EDFA) module. The EDFL produced a train of &#732;2 psec pulses at 4 MHz, tunable over the erbium gain band ( 1520 - 1570 nm). The laser was constructed from commercially available components and had the property of stability combined with low pump power requirements to produce &#732;50 Watt peak power pulses. The laser cavity geometry included a nonlinear optical loop mirror, which has the property of efficiently switching high peak power pulses, and allowed pulsed operation without the aid of any high-speed electronics. An EDFA module of identical geometry to that used in the laser was also constructed, and this was probed using the pulses from the EDFL. The traditional temporal and spectral measurements were found to be inadequate to allow a complete description of the pulse amplification process to be developed. To overcome this problem the technique of frequency resolved optical gating (FROG) was applied for the first time to optical fibre research, and allowed an indirect measurement of the electric field of the pulse. This complete description of the pulse was used in a numerical model to describe pulse propagation in an optical fibre. Fundamental propagation terms in the model were treated as free parameters in a minimisation scheme, which could be determined for a fibre under examination. This technique was shown to be accurate when used to examine pulse propagation through both standard and dispersion shifted optical fibre. A comprehensive numerical model was developed for the EDFA, and it was apparent from this model that a pulse propagating through an optimised EDFA encounters an atomic inversion distribution which is a strong function of distance along the amplifying fibre. It was also shown from the experimental results that the EDFA exhibited resonant dispersion, which is characteristic for propagation through an atomic medium on resonance.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::240000 Physical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1983</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Approaches to the synthesis of anthracyclinones</field><field name="creator">Boniface, Peter James</field><field name="description">The Claisen rearrangement of 1,4-bis(prop-2'-enyloxy)anthraquinone under reducing conditions is investigated.

A.</field><field name="description">An experimental group (Group A) of 22 children around 7 years of age who had normal hearing for pure tones but who had experienced neonatal jaundice with peak bilirubin levels of at least 300 &#181;mol/l was tested on a range of audiological tests selected to assess aspects of their central auditory processing. Children who had not been tested for bilirubin level were selected as control subjects (Group B); they were matched on the variables gender, race, gestational age, birthweight, Apgar scores and occurrence of respiratory problems. A smaller experimental group, Group C (n=7), with peak bilirubin levels between 250 and 299 &#181;mol/l but with perinatal complications was also studied. The experimental groups had higher mean acoustic reflex thresholds and lower mean reflex amplitudes than the control group. Acoustic reflex threshold patterns of abnormality consistent with central dysfunction occurred in two children from the main experimental group and two children in the control group. None of the children from Group C showed abnormal reflex thresholds. Acoustic reflex amplitude patterns of abnormality consistent with central dysfunction were present in six children from Group A and two children from Group C, compared with three children from the control group. Masking level differences were absent in five subjects from Group A and three children from Group C, compared with three control subjects. No group differences were evident for ABR latency or amplitude measures, but poor morphology or repeatability of wave V was observed in ten subjects from Group A and three children from Group C, compared with five children from the control group. A larger number of failures within the experimental groups was found for two of the four speech tests, that is, for interrupted and filtered speech tests, but not speech in noise or competing words tests. Five children from Group A (but none from Group C) performed poorly on the interrupted speech test, compared with two from Group B. The filtered speech test was failed by six children from Group A and two children from Group C, compared with two from Group B. Parental reports of behavioural or learning disorders were distributed equally among the groups and were not associated with particular patterns of test failure. Overall, children in the experimental groups failed significantly more tests of central auditory functioning than did children in the control group (F(2,48)=5.5,p&lt;.01). The results were interpreted as implicating jaundice in long-term central auditory processing abnormalities.</field><field name="date">1990</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1986</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Quantitative and Qualitative Analysis of Women&#8217;s Body Image: Comparisons Between Normal Weight, Overweight, Eating Disordered and Body Building Women</field><field name="creator">Hammond, Kay Maree</field><field name="description">This thesis approaches the area of women's body image with the aim of expanding existing knowledge based on traditional male/female comparisons of how women respond to quantitative measures of body image. It does so by distinguishing between some different body-type groups of women. These were mostly Caucasian women aged eighteen and over who lived in the greater Auckland area. They were grouped as: normal weight (n=43); overweight (n=37); women with eating disturbances (n=27); and body builders (n=17). A pilot study involving ten normal weight women examined the face validity of several established international measures of body image as well as additional ones developed for the main study. The established questionnaires were: the Rosenberg Self Esteem Scale, the Body Esteem Scale, the Weight Locus of Control Scale, a Figure Rating Scale and a Silhouette Rating scale. The newer measures consisted of modifications made to the Figure Rating Scale and the Silhouette Rating scale. Verbal questions about teasing history were also asked, the intention being to formulate a teasing history questionnaire for the main study. These measures were found to be valid by the women. In part one of the main study quantitative comparisons between the groups revealed some differences, but also some surprising similarities. Desirable body types of normal weight and muscular physique were described positively in physical and personality terms. The undesirable body types of thin and overweight received negative descriptions irrespective of the women's own group membership. The eating disordered women scored the lowest self-esteem while the other groups did not differ. The body builders scored the highest body-esteem while the normal weight and overweight, and overweight and eating disordered groups did not differ. Correlations between self-esteem and body-esteem were significant for all groups except the body builders. The correlation was strong for the eating disordered group and moderate for the normal weight and overweight groups. In the Figure Rating Scale the body builders chose more muscular ideal figures than the other groups and for all groups the ideal and current figures were usually one figure size different. At least half the women in each group felt their body was the same size as they thought it was' Of those remaining who gave different answers to the think versus feel ratings, nearly all in the eating disordered group reported they felt bigger. In the other groups there was an even split between those who felt bigger and those who felt smaller than they thought they were. The women were most united in their selection of the figure they thought men would find most attractive. In approximately a quarter to one third of each group (excluding the body builders due to small numbers) the figure selected as attractive to men was also chosen as the self ideal. Approximately a quarter of each group [excluding body builders) selected the same self ideal and peer ideal, however a considerable percentage of women selected a larger self ideal than peer ideal. All groups reported there should not be an ideal figure at all in society. All groups tended to believe that their weight was under their own control. Most women reported having been teased about their appearance and being affected by this teasing. This was especially noticeable for the eating disordered group, a considerable percentage reporting they still felt adversely affected by it. Part two of the study introduces feminist poststructuralist theory and the Foucaultian concept of power and discourse analysis as ways to explore body image research. The body image literature introduced in part one is then revisited showing how this area of research can be harmful for women. The presentation of the interviews with 28 women follows, seven women from each body type group. A short form of discourse analysis was used for the women's responses to issues in body building, their explanations of the self-esteem, body-esteem, and the results of the correlation of the two. Issues related to the presence of an ideal figure size in society are also discussed. A longer form of discourse analysis was involved for the readings of the women's accounts of having been teased about their appearance. These readings showed many women located their accounts of teasing within a discourse of trivialisation-of-teasing, indicating that the seemingly trivial practice of teasing is a powerful form of social control, resulting in feelings of vulnerability. The study concluded with summaries and conclusions from the literature presented in the introductions of both parts one and two. The quantitative and qualitative research methods were compared to see what both could offer body image research. Finally speculations were made about directions which body image research could take at both the individual and cultural level.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1987</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterisation of glycoprotein II from bovine adrenal medulla</field><field name="creator">Hieber, A. David (Andrew David), 1966-</field><field name="description">Glycoprotein II (GpII) is a glycoprotein isolated from the membranes of chromaffin granules in the adrenal medulla. The chromaffin granules of the adrenal medulla are responsible for the biosynthesis, storage and secretion of catecholamines, neuropeptides and various proteins. The abundance of chromaffin granules makes them an excellent model to further study the organelles specialized in the synthesis and secretion of hormones and neurotransmitters, from both endocrine and synaptic vesicles. When viewed by two-dimensional electrophoresis GpII is a heterogeneoug glycoprotein (80000-100000 daltons) consisting of two components, upper (GpIIa) and lower (GpIIb). Protein and immunological characterisation revealed that the two components of GpII are distinct from each other. Further molecular characterisation of GpIIa showed that it consisted of a 1224 base pair cDNA, encoding a 383 amino acid polypeptide, with a calculated molecular mass of 40500 daltons. This characterisation also revealed 19 potential glycosylation sites, with deglycosylation studies further demonstrating that an estimated 55% of the molecular mass of GpII is asparagine-linked carbohydrate. The presence of poly-N-acetyllactosamine carbohydrate groups on GpII was also demonstrated. The predicted amino acid sequence of GpIIa shares a 72% amino acid identity with the human lamp-l type protein, which belongs to a highly conserved group of lysosomal associated membrane glycoproteins (lamp proteins). As the C-terminal region of GpIIa was identical to the C-terminal region of lamp proteins, a synthetic peptide to the C-terminal region of GpII was used to raise antisera to this region. This antisera was then used to demonstrate that the C-terminal region of GpII wag present on chromaffin granules and facing the cytoplasm. This same C-terminal region on lamp proteins is known to be a cytoplasmic tail that is essential for the intracellular targeting of lamp proteins to the lysosome. A common feature to the pathways of both GpII and lamp proteins is their appearance on the cell surface followed by internalisation via endocytosis. As endocytosis of the chromaffin granule membrane is known to occur, the possibility that GpII was a marker for endocytosis was investigated. The presence of GpII within clathrin coated vesicles was shown, and evidence was presented to demonstrate that the C-terminal region of GpII interacts with adaptor proteins of clathrin coated vesicles. Adaptor proteins are known to mediate between the cytoplasmic domain of proteins internalised by endocytosis, and the outside coat of clathrin. The evidence presented would suggest that the cytoplasmic tail of GpII is a potential marker for endocytosis within the chromaffin granule membrane. The results presented in this study indicate that GpII is the secretory granule and species counterpart to the lamp proteins. This finding however raises some interesting questions regarding intracellular targeting between the lysosomes and secretory granules within the chromaffin cell.</field><field name="date">1993</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270100 Biochemistry and Cell Biology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1988</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Implementation of a bubble model in FLAC and its application in dynamic analysis</field><field name="creator">Ni, Bing</field><field name="description">Methodologies of implementing nonlinear constitutive models of soil in FLAC are studied in order to reduce numerical distortion, which has been found to occur in nonlinear dynamic analysis when a nonlinear soil model is implemented using an &#8216;apparent modulus&#8217; approach. Analyses undertaken using several simple nonlinear soil models indicate that use of &#8216;plastic correction&#8217; approach can eliminate or minimize the problem. This approach is therefore adopted in the thesis to implement in FLAC a bounding surface bubble soil model, i.e. the Bubble model. Satisfactory performance of the Bubble model has been obtained in dynamic analysis without using any of the additional mechanical damping given in FLAC. An analytical study on the Bubble model is carried out with FLAC. On the basis of the study, the hardening function is modified to better incorporate size ratio effects of the yield surface and is explored to eliminate abrupt transition in stiffness from elastic region to yielding. Pore water pressure is formulated with the assumption that the pore water pressure is generated as a response to the constant volume constraint which prevents the tendency for volume change when plastic volumetric strain takes place. The formulation is added to the Bubble model so that pore water pressure can be generated automatically by the model for fully saturated and undrained soil. FLAC analyses indicate that the Bubble model is generally in good agreement with published experimental data. The parameters and initial conditions associated with the Bubble model are studied with FLAC analyses in triaxial stress space to investigate their influence on the model and to investigate their effective ranges. Both large and small strain behaviors of the model are explored in the parametric study. Finally, the Bubble model is applied in the modeling of vertical vibration of rigid strip foundations. The influence of soil nonlinearity on vertical compliance of rigid foundations is investigated. Some major factors are considered, which include initial stress level in soil, level of excitation and mass ratio of foundation.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290800 Civil Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2319</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Isolation and characterisation of N-glycans of ovine and human luteinizing hormones</field><field name="creator">Hiyama, Jun</field><field name="description">Gonadotrophic hormones are heterodimeric glycoproteins and their N-glycans attached to specific amino acid residues are currently thought to play important roles in hormonal biosynthesis, secretion and function. The studies reported in this thesis aimed at isolation and characterisation of structural properties of the N-glycans on ovine and human luteinizing hormones. Initially, chromatographic methods were developed using reverse-phase HPLC for the analytical separation of the three human pituitary glycoprotein hormones and their subunits. Separation of intact oLH and its subunits was also effected by a single HPLC step. A preparative procedure was developed for the efficient purification of hLH and hTSH from crude human pituitary extracts using hydrophobic chromatography which gave highly purified hormones in good yields and with high biological activities. This method did not significantly influence the hormones' extensive charge heterogeneity and it offered potential advantages in the characterisation of their carbohydrate structures. A preparative scheme was developed for the isolation of the N-linked oligosaccharides from each glycosylation site of o- and hLH. Charge heterogeneity of oligosaccharides, which were released by hydrazinolysis from subunits and glycopeptides, was characterised by anion-exchange HPLC. 1H-NMR analysis showed that the structures of all three N-glycans on hLH were highly heterogeneous but mainly diantennary complex-type, with site-specific patterns of terminal sialylation and sulphation as well as core-fucosylation. Sulphated/sialylated and/or disialylated oligosaccharides were the major components at each site. A set of new mono- and disialylated oligosaccharides with the terminal sequence NeuAc&#945;2-6GalNAc&#946;1-4G1-cNAc&#946;1-2Man&#945;1-3 was identified. This finding suggested unique site-specific terminal sialylation of oligosaccharides at Asn 78 (hLH&#945;) by an unknown &#945;2-6 sialyltransferase(s) in the human pituitary gonadotroph cell. Each glycosylation site in oLH had a distinct set of oligosaccharides ranging from mainly monosulphated hybrid-type at the two sites of oLH&#945; to predominantly disulphated diantennary complex-type on oLH&#946;. Core-fucosylation also differed at each site. These results suggested that processing of the oligosaccharides of the &#945;- and &#946;-subunits by &#945;-mannosidase II and &#945;1-6 fucosyltransferase was differently regulated by protein structure in oLH. Whereas hCG, hLH and oLH share similar biological activities, no apparent relationship between their N-glycan structures was found, which suggested that specific branching and peripheral structures of N-glycans on LH and hCG may not be essential for biological function, although the N-glycan nearer the N-terminus of the &#945;-subunit of hCG has been implicated in hormonal activity.</field><field name="date">1991</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270100 Biochemistry and Cell Biology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1989</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Assessment of the quality of observers' records of behaviour</field><field name="creator">Mudford, Oliver Charles</field><field name="description">The measurement of behaviour by direct observation may be improved when observers have been provided with equipment which enables real-time recording. There are no data available concerning the quality of this type of measurement. Indeed, there is no consensus among researchers as to appropriate methods of quality assessment. In the present series of studies, observers were provided with hand-held computers programmed to act as real-time recorders. The quality of their records was assessed by three "traditional" methods, representative of those which have been used most frequently in previous behavioural research: interobserver agreement, observer/criterion agreement, and relative error. An instrument calibration procedure, the standard method for measurement accuracy analysis in the natural sciences and engineering, was demonstrated for comparison with traditional methods. The traditional methods were found to be unsatisfactory for theoretical and empirical reasons. The calibration procedure was shown to have some considerable potential advantages for applied behaviour analysis. Disadvantages, both statistical and practical, were also discussed.</field><field name="date">1990</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1990</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The development, ultrastructure and biomechanics of the swimbladder of the New Zealand snapper, Pagrus auratus</field><field name="creator">Ling, Nicholas</field><field name="description">The eggs and larvae of the New Zealand snapper Pagrus auratus are pelagic with early buoyancy provided by dilute body fluids. The swimbladder begins to develop on the third day after hatch from a dorsal evagination of the gut tube. Communication w1h the gut is lost on about the tenth day following pneumatic inflation at around day eight. At this age the gas gland system appears fully functional and capable of secreting gas. By the age of settlement at around 30 days the swimbladder is a fully functional replica of the adult form except for the lack of a resorbent capillary system which does not develop until later in juvenile life. The swimbladder of the adult is of the euphysoclist form with a dorsally located resorbent oval area and sits high in the pleural cavity. The ventral tunica externa is firmly attached to the connective tissue lining the pleural space. The adult swimbladder displaces 5.6% of the volume of the body and its volume is regulated to provide near neutral buoyancy. The connective tissue integument provides almost no restriction to volume changes brought about by vertical movements of the fish and the swimbladder obeys Boyle's Law for physiological pressure changes. The ability of the connective tissue of the tunica externa to accommodate large tissue strains is due to massive regular crimping of otherwise straight collagen fibrils allowing reversible extensions up to 130%. In all other respects however the tissue structure of the tunica externa is consistent with a tissue providing an active mechanical role. The fibrillar morphology and physicochemical properties of swimbladder collagen is consistent with the vertebrate type I form however there are interesting variations in collagen form distributed throughout the swimbladder. Fibrillar morphology of the highly extensible tunica interna is significantly different to that of the tunica externa and appears to play very little mechanical rote. The extensibilty of the tunica externa appears to be regulated by physiological stress and related to the past history of tissue strain.</field><field name="date">1990</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270700 Ecology and Evolution::270702 Marine and estuarine ecology (incl. marine ichthyology)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2012</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Synthetic studies with diterpenoids</field><field name="creator">Ryan, Glen Richard</field><field name="description">Chapter one of this thesis reports an investigation of the synthesis of potential amber odorants from abietic acid. The acid catalysed rearrangement of abietic acid afforded two isomeric dienes the structures of which have been elucidated. Compounds containing the diene functionality were found to be unstable. However, removal of the diene system afforded stable compounds which are suited to further synthetic modification. Although the skeletal features possessed by a class of amber odorants were successfully introduced stereochemical control proved difficult. The stereochemistry of two intermediates was unambiguosly assigned by single-crystal X-ray diffraction experiments. The second chapter describes the successful conversion of totarol into conjugated dienolides possessing the B/C-ring present in type A and type C nagilactones. Consequently totarol may be considered as a useful model for the preparation of the biologically active nagilactones. In the course of this work several unusual rearrangements were observed. The products of rearrangement were characterised by 2-D n.m.r. and single crystal X-ray diffraction experiments and reaction mechanisms are proposed. The third chapter of this thesis reports the synthesis of the amber odorant, &#947;-bicyclohomofarnesal, from podocarpic acid. Analogues in which C-19 is functionalised were also prepared.

E.</field><field name="description">This thesis reviews the evolution of interim reporting in New Zealand. The attempts to regulate interim reporting by the stock Exchange Association of New Zealand and the lobbying behaviour of affected parties are documented. The regulation of interim reporting is interpreted as a series of self-interest actions by the affected parties. In 1973 semiannual reports were mandated for all firms listed on the New Zealand stock Exchange. However, the content of these reports, was not specified until 1976. The extent of voluntary reporting practice prior to 1973 is recorded. The major empirical analysis of the thesis examines the association between corporate characteristics and the voluntary disclosure of semiannual earnings during the period 1973 to 1976. The analysis shows that firms with high semiannual earnings disclosures have more shares issued, have paid an interim dividend, carry relatively less inventory, are in a more seasonal industry and have a greater earnings forecast error. Assets in place, political costs of disclosure and competitive costs of disclosure are not found to be associated with the level of semiannual earnings disclosure. Sensitivity analysis indicates that the significance of the explanatory variables depends on firm size and upon the threshold level of disclosure.</field><field name="date">1988</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350100 Accounting, Auditing and Accountability</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1992</field></doc><doc><field name="title">From Qing reformer to twentieth-century publisher: the life and times of Zhang Yuanji 1867 &#8211; 1959</field><field name="creator">Ip, Manying</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the role of Zhang Yuanji, both as a liberal patriotic reformer in late Qing and as China's leading publisher after 1900. A historical figure hardly known to the West, Zhang contributed substantially to China's modernization in his quiet pragmatic style. When China was challenged by the imperialist West, the response of the nation's scholar-gentry elite ranged from spirited calls for wholesale westernization to a stubborn clinging to the 'national essence'. Individuals at the extremes of this range have received more attention from historians than the middle-of-the-road group of moderates, who in the twentieth century worked for modernization without discarding tradition totally. Zhang Yuanji was a typical figure in this group who attained intellectual maturity under Confucianism and yet was open-minded enough to accept Western philosophies and to adopt Western practices of entrepreneurship. Zhang Yuanji's in tense sense of patriotic obligation to introduce progressive learning for China's benefit while popularizing the best of the classical heritage was coupled with a culturalistic viewpoint that there could be no genuine changes unless a certain percentage of China'S thinking population became modernized in outlook, well-informed of world affairs, and imbued with a progressive spirit. Zhang pioneered in modern education from 1896 and remained a dedicated educationalist all his life. His publishing career in the Commercial Press can be viewed as a logical extension of his early aim of modernizing China through the spread of new knowledge. The history of the Commercial Press and in particular Zhang's part in it have received little scholarly attention, previous treatments of the subject have relied heavily on two official Commercial Press histories and the autobiographical writings of Wang Yunwu, which neglect Zhang's major contributions. The Commercial Press, as the largest publishing house in modern China, was in the forefront of educational, scholarly, and literary development in China from 1900 to the 1950s, and Zhang played a vital role in promoting progressive publications as well as preserving the best editions of classics and histories. Zhang's efforts to run the Commercial Press successfully through all the political upheavals that beset China from late Qing to after 1949 reveal both the scholar's attempts to keep up with all the latest ideological trends as well as the entrepreneur's ambition to run a modern business efficiently. A study of Zhang Yuanji's life and career is in part a study of the evolution of China's gentry-elite and the emergence of the native capitalists. The thesis draws on newly-available primary materials, both in the original and in manuscript, including over a thousand of Zhang's letters, several hundred poems and essays, and the extant sections of his business diary. These materials are supplemented by information provided by Zhang's surviving literary and editorial colleagues. Internal publications and source-materials of the Commercial Press are also used to reconstruct this biography of a little-known man who worked for China's modernization by drawing on his solid learning about China's past.</field><field name="date">1983</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::430000 History and Archaeology::430100 Historical Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1993</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Order Hadromerida (Porifera: Demospongiae), taxonomy and relationships of the major families</field><field name="creator">Kelly-Borges, Michelle</field><field name="description">Despite advances of recent years no stable higher order classification of the Porifera has yet emerged.

The focus was on reading and language achievement, measured by standardized tests and the process of reading demonstrated when engaged in reading prose. The children were the entire population of severely and profoundly deaf, aged from 5 to 10 years at the commencement of the study, who had no other educational handicaps. They were being educated within a Total Communication programme at the Kelston School for Deaf and associated unit classrooms. Reading achievement was assessed by the Gates-MacGinitie Reading Assessment Test on three occasions, each one year apart. Reading achievement was also assessed by documenting accuracy and comprehension (retelling) when reading natural language texts. Language achievement was measured using the Grammatical Analysis of Elicited Language (Moog and Geers, 1979, 1980). The relationship between reading and language achievement was established. The reading of natural language stories was analyzed to establish the pattern of errors (miscues) on text at two levels of difficulty for the reader. Categories of semantically appropriate, syntactically appropriate, grammatically similar, the omission of inflectional morphemes, fingerspelt miscues and signing errors were established. Comparisons were made between age groups, proficiency groups(High and Low) and across developmental levels. Cloze passages were also analysed to assess the use of contextual information by these readers. Analyses of Variance (ANOVA) were undertaken for each miscue category in the signed reading, classified by age and proficiency of the reader, and difficulty of the text. Analyses of variance (ANOVA) were undertaken for the miscue categories classified by reading level, and the cloze exercise substitution classified by age and proficiency of the reader. Observations of classroom reading instructions were included to document the environment within which the children were being educated. Six individual case studies, three high progress and three low progress, were also analyzed. The findings suggest that reading achievement of these severely and profoundly deaf readers is still low. This is consistent with previous studies but achievement in comparison with earlier New Zealand data and data from surveys in the U.S. was slightly higher. This study supported previous research that suggested that standardized tests of reading do not adequately measure the reading achievement of deaf readers. High positive correlations (r &#8805;.90) between reading and language achievement were interpreted to be bi-directional and suggestive that higher rates of engaged time in reading could facilitate greater reading and language development. An integrated/interactive model most appropriately described the process of reading for these deaf readers as for hearing readers. Like hearing readers these deaf readers, at all ages and both high and low progress, were able to utilize contextual cues, and textual cues as they interacted with text. However, several unique differences in the process of reading have important implications for instruction. Low levels of syntactic cues during signed reading, it was suggested, reflect the readers use of their language in use and sensitivity to task factors. Fingerspelling was demonstrated to be a potentially useful strategy that was used at a significantly higher rate by High Progress readers. High Progress readers were more able than Low progress readers to use strategies ensuring fluency in order to construct meaning from texts Observations of classroom reading indicated that the rate of engaged time in reading was not high and that although the teachers espoused a meaning-emphasis some practices in the classroom did not foster independent problem solving readers. The educational implications of the data were discussed.</field><field name="date">1988</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1995</field></doc><doc><field name="title">FTIR studies of surface adsorption on noble metal hydrosols</field><field name="creator">Mucalo, Michael Roger</field><field name="description">Carbon monoxide adsorption, surface speciation and particle size distributions have been studied in platinum, palladium, and rhodium hydrosol systems using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy. In transmission electron micrographs of unprotected platinum and palladium hydrosols, particle necklacing believed to arise from sintering during preparation, is apparent. The average particle sizes of all hydrosols studied were in the range of 2 to 12 nm. X-ray photoelectron spectra of the metal hydrosols revealed evidence for (Pt-O)ads, Pt(II) and Pt(IV) oxides on platinum hydrosol particles whereas Pd(II) and Pd(IV) oxides were detected on the surfaces of palladium hydrosol particles. These surface oxides are found to be important in influencing hydrosol surface processes such as CO adsorption as a function of pH, inhibition of CO adsorption by alcohols and surface corrosion products resulting from the addition of iodide and cyanide. Fourier transform infrared spectra of CO-treated metal hydrosols revealed bands due to CO linearly adsorbed on the metal particles at ca. 2070 cm-1 (Pt), 2067 cm-1 (Pd) and 2045 cm-1 (Rh) whereas bands due to bridge-adsorbed (B2) CO were detected at ca.1950 cm-1 (Pd) and 1890 cm-1 (Rh). The use of CO as a spectroscopic probe molecule enabled the study of changes in the surface properties of the metal hydrosols which were induced by changes in the dispersion medium. For example, v(CO)ads was observed to decrease in infrared spectra of CO-treated platinum and rhodium hydrosols as pH was increased by KOH or other dissolved salts yielding alkaline solutions. This suggested a reduction in CO coverage resulting from hydroxyl adsorption and consequent increased oxide growth on the particles. In contrast, CO adsorption on platinum and rhodium hydrosols was enhanced in acidic media possibly as a result of the neutralisation of surface hydroxyls. The spectroscopic behaviour of adsorbed CO on platinum and rhodium hydrosols was only comparable to that of CO adsorbed at an electrode surface in acidic media when protecting agent was present which prevented aggregation of the hydrosol in such media. Inhibition of CO adsorption on platinum hydrosols was induced by the addition of aliphatic alcohols, poly(vinyl alcohol) and poisoning anions such as CN- and SH-. Correlations of v(CO)ads with CO coverage suggested that island formation of adsorbed CO was occurring for CO adsorption on unprotected palladium hydrosols and protected platinum and rhodium hydrosols as a function of pH. In allied investigations, an infrared spectroelectrochemical study of corrosion of a nickel electrode in aqueous cyanide media has revealed that [Ni(CN)4]2- is detected at potentials more cathodic than 200 mV vs. SCE. Cyanide was oxidised to cyanate (OCN-) and then successively to carbon dioxide at potentials more anodic than 200 mV vs. SCE. The appearance of features at 2094 cm-1 (HCN) and 2256 cm-1 (HNCO) were attributed to pH changes associated with the oxidation of cyanide to cyanate. The appearance of a band at ca. 2218 cm-1 in infrared spectra of the thin layer at very high potentials (&gt; 1000 mV vs. SCE) was believed to arise from an unstable nickel(II) isocyanate complex.</field><field name="date">1991</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1996</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Enhancements to an object-oriented programming language</field><field name="creator">Mugridge, Warwick Bruce</field><field name="description">The objective of this thesis has been to explore the value and limitations of Class, an object-oriented programming language, in order to further the development of the language. The pivot for this thesis is WallBrace, a code-checking system. The development of the WallBrace system is the basis of a critique of Class, and leads to a number of language extensions being proposed. An important aim in this work has been the careful integration of these enhancements with the rest of the language, avoiding unnecessary additions. A number of functional and object-oriented extensions to the language are proposed. Discrimination functions, which may be higher-order and polymorphic, add considerable functional power. Generic classes allow for abstract data types, such as sets and lists, to be defined within the language. The forms interface proposed will greatly enhance the quality of user interfaces to Class programs. An external interface will allow Class programs to communicate with files, databases, and specialist user-interface programs, such as for plan entry.</field><field name="date">1990</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1997</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Young people's reactions to nuclear issues : a constructivist analysis</field><field name="creator">Oliver, Pam, 1949-</field><field name="description">The 1980s saw an increasing interest amongst psychologists, both as researchers and as practitioners, in the ways in which people react to nuclear weapons issues, especially the perceived threat of nuclear war. Much of the research in relation to "nuclear threat", undertaken either within the United States or by United States psychiatrists in collaboration with European colleagues, and using extensive questionnaire surveys, focused on the fears of children and teenagers. Some researchers concluded that large proportions of young people were at risk of impaired psychological development because of nuclear threat which resulted in a pervasive sense of futurelessness and a distrust of .adults. This research has been widely criticised since because of apparent researcher bias in the methods used, interpretations offered, and general paradigm. I also found much of the research ethically objectionable. My research has involved 52 interviews with young New Zealanders and administration of a questionnaire to more than 2000 others, including ages nine to 18 and three ethnocultural groups, as well as interviews with some teachers. The objectives of these studies were: (1) to produce detailed information about how young New Zealanders react to nuclear weapons issues which might be used by educationalists, mental health professionals, parents, and young people themselves in dealing with those issues; (2) to make specific recommendations about young New Zealanders' apparent needs and preferences for learning about and dealing with nuclear weapons and related issues; (3) to provide a detailed methodological comparison of interview and questionnaire approaches to this research topic, and discuss issues of theory and paradigm; and (4) to comment on ethical and practical issues for both the researcher and the researched in undertaking research on emotive and potentially distressing topics, especially with young people. As a result Chapter 1 of my thesis contains a comprehensive critical review of the international research and theory relating to young people's perceptions of nuclear weapons, examining the problems of method, interpretation and paradigm associated with this area of research. Both interview and survey data are presented in relation to: (a) young people's levels of awareness and sources of information about nuclear issues; (b) their emotional, cognitive and behavioural reactions to nuclear issues, including coping strategies and activism: (c) their perceptions of the future; (d) comparisons across gender, age and ethnocultural group; (e) the role of adults; and (f) differences between New Zealanders and other national groups. The data are discussed in terms of: (i) their patterns, contexts and meanings; (ii) their implications for peace and global issues education; and (iii) their implications for research method, including ethical issues. Recommendations are made for how psychologists and others can help young people and adults in dealing with global and social threats, including how to undertake research which is empowering as well as valid and useful.</field><field name="date">1992</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1998</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Panbiogeography: a cladistic approach</field><field name="creator">Page, Roderic D.M.

Yolk-sac larval P.auratus hatched at a small size (2.00mm SL), without functional eyes, mouth or digestive tract, and for three days spent long periods at rest. Growth was initially rapid but slowed by 3 days as yolk reserves neared depletion. By days 4-5, the mouth had opened, eyes were functional, yolk was depleted, and a rudimentary gut had formed. Larvae were now able to maintain a horizontal swimming mode and were actively searching for and attacking prey. First feeding was observed in some larvae. Growth was retarded during the transition from endogenous to exogenous nutrition and then increased as feeding proficiency improved. Yolk-sac F.varium hatched at a larger size (4.78mm SL), with functional eyes and jaws. Larvae were able to maintain a horizontal swimming mode from hatching. First feeding was observed from the first day after hatching. F.varium larvae grew steadily from the time of hatching. Ocular morphology was examined in larval, juvenile and adult P.auratus and F.varium. There was a 96 fold increase in eye size, from 0.23mm diameter in a 4 day old larval P.auratus (3.4mm SL) to a maximum diameter of 22mm in an adult of 333mm body length. F.varium displayed a 26 fold increase in eye size, from 0.28mm diameter in the smallest larva (5.00mm SL) to a maximum eye diameter of 7.2mm in a 11gmm long adult. Larval fish had pure cone retinae, however putative rod precursor cells were present from hatching in F.varium and from 18 days in P.auratus. Juvenile and adult fish had duplex retinae with cones arranged in a square mosaic in which 4 twin cones surround a central single cone. Hypertrophy of cone ellipsoids with increasing eye size, resulted in maintenance of a closely packed array in fishes of all sizes. The appearance of retinomotor movements was coincident with the development of a duplex retina in both species. Theoretical spatial acuity (calculated as a function of cone spacing and focal length of the lens) was poor in the smallest larval fish (2&#176; 1' and 1&#176; 8' minimum separable angle in 4 and 1 day old P.auratus and F.varium respectively) but improved to asymptotic values in adults (3'- 4', and 9' in P.auratus and F.varium respectively). Behavioural acuity (determined using the optokinetic response) of 4 day old larval P.auratus (37&#176; 30') and 1 day old F.varium (29&#176;) was very much lower than histological estimates. Behavioural acuity improved to 8&#176; 8' in 16 day old P.auratus and 4&#176; 18' in 14 day old F.varium, but did not attain theoretical estimates for fish of that size (55' and 54'). A rudimentary retractor lentis muscle was first apparent in larval fish 1 week after hatching, and was coincident with the formation of a posterior lental space. Presumably larval fish eyes were incapable of accomodative lens movements until this time. A relative measure of Matthiessen's ratio (distance from lens centre to boundary of the pigmented retinal epithelium/lens radius) measured histologically, decreased from 4.2 and 2.7 in 3 day old P.auratus and newly hatched F.varium, to 2.2 and 2.3 in larvae 22 and 16 days of age respectively. This suggests that growth of the retina and lens were not symmetrical in the eyes of very small larval fish. If Matthiessen's ratio holds for little eyes, then they will initially be strongly myopic. This may account in part for the mismatch between behavioural and theoretical acuity. Perceptive distances of first feeding larval P.auratus and F.varium, estimated for prey items equal in dimensions to maximum jaw widths, were very small (0.2mm and 0.4mm for prey 0.15mm and 0.2mm in size respectively), but increased with increasing body size to 2.1mm and 4.0mm for prey 0.3mm in size, at 16 and 14 days of age respectively. These data have implications for larval feeding in the wild.</field><field name="date">1991</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270500 Zoology</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270700 Ecology and Evolution::270702 Marine and estuarine ecology (incl. marine ichthyology)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2000</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Molecular studies on actinidin, a cysteine protease from kiwifruit</field><field name="creator">Podivinsky, Ellen</field><field name="description">Research in this thesis describes the characterisation of mRNA sequences coding for actinidin, a cysteine protease found in abundance in the fruit of kiwifruit (Actinidia deliciosa). The first step in the characterisation required the isolation of mRNA from ripe kiwifruit tissue. The suitability of a number of RNA extraction procedures was investigated. The method finally adopted differed from that used for unripe fruit tissue, and was chosen as a result of the nature of the polysaccharide that contaminated nucleic acids prepared from extracts of kiwifruit fruit tissue. RNA extracted from ripe fruit was used to synthesis a partial cDNA library and clones for actinidin were isolated. A number of these cDNA clones were sequenced; three clones were almost full-length. The actinidin cDNA clones obtained fall into two broad sequence classes. The majority of them encode acidic proteins (pI&#732;4.7), with 97% homology to the published amino acid sequence of actinidin. The second class encode basic proteins (pI&#732;8.1), with 83% homology to the published amino acid sequence of actinidin. Both classes of actinidin cDNA sequence encode zymogens, which contain N- and C-terminal extensions not present in the mature form of the enzyme. The N-terminal extension of both sequence classes includes a putative signal peptide. Northern hybridization analysis was used to investigate the tissue specificity of actinidin mRNA expression, and the expression of mRNA for the two actinidin sequence classes during fruit ripening. Both actinidin sequence classes were expressed differentially during the latter stages of kiwifruit fruit development and through post-harvest fruit ripening. The expression of both sequence classes increased from just prior to fruit maturity through ripening and reached a maximum as fruit attained the stage of 'eating' ripeness. The level of expression of the sequences encoding acidic actinidin reached a plateau at this point, while the expression of the sequence encoding basic actinidin appeared to decrease slightly as fruit continued to ripen. The sequences encoding acidic actinidin were expressed during ripening at a much higher level than those encoding basic actinidin. No actinidin mRNA was detected in other tissues except for very low levels of the acidic form in kiwifruit leaf, and low levels of the basic form in senescing petals. A full-length, acidic, actinidin cDNA sequence was introduced into tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) plants via Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation. Using the binary vector pGA643, the sequence was introduced in both the sense and antisense orientation relative to the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter and transgenic plants were obtained for both sequence orientations. The presence of the T-DNA cassette (containing the actinidin sequence) in the plant genomes was determined using PCR analysis, and confirmed by Southern hybridization. A number of the transgenic plants contained multiple insertions of the actinidin sequence, and most plants contained at least one intact copy of the T-DNA cassette. The transcription of the introduced actinidin sequence was investigated by Northern hybridization analysis. All of the plants containing actinidin in the sense orientation, and some of those incorporating the antisense construct, transcribed the actinidin sequence. Attempts to detect actinidin protein in the transgenic plants were unsuccessful. Acidic actinidin was identified as one of the most abundant bands in the total protein profile from ripe kiwifruit fruit tissue. The identity of the protein was confirmed by N-terminal sequence analysis. The electrophoretic mobility of actinidin, both in the total cell homogenate and when partially purified, suggested that the first step in post-translational processing of the zymogen may be the removal of the N-terminal extension. Actinidin was also partially purified and used to raise antibodies. Poor specificity of the antibody for actinidin led to preliminary evidence for the glycosylation of actinidin.</field><field name="date">1991</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270100 Biochemistry and Cell Biology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2001</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of the relationships between housing patterns, social class and political attitudes in three Auckland electorates</field><field name="creator">Prince, John D. (John David)</field><field name="description">There is a strain of social criticism, dating back to the fifties and sixties, which alleged that New Zealand was about to become a society more clearly divided by lines related to "class". New Zealand was presented as a society in which a natural egalitarianism of social habits and attitudes had flourished. The critical voices of this earlier period feared that as New Zealand's economy evolved further, so would the degree of social demarcation within society. They expected that these changes would show up most rapidly, and with deeper effects, in the northernmost part of New Zealand, particularly in Auckland. There the postwar period's industrial development and population growth was greatest. In the suburbs of the north, middle class beliefs and life styles would develop. Suburban life, in areas of new housing containing those who most notably benefited from these changes, would provide mutual reinforcements for the evolution of a much more consciously middle class way of life. Many of the implications of this social criticism are explored in this thesis by means of a questionnaire professionally administered to a sample of 312 respondents in three Auckland electorates. East Coast Bays was chosen as an example of a burgeoning middle class suburb, Te Atatu as a newer area of working class settlement, and Birkenhead as a bridge between the two of them, socially and politically. The survey was administered shortly before the 1978 general election. A variety of facts about, and attitudes to, housing, employment, life styles, suburban locations and indistrialisation are explored. These are normally related back to the basic dependent variables of voting choice, electorate, the propensity to think in class terms, and subjective class identification. The overwhelming pressure of the evidence is that of continuity with the egalitarian past. The chief hypothesis tested is that "following on the most rapid processes of postwar industrialisation in New Zealand, new suburban contexts have evolved in Auckland in which the middle class beneficiaries of Auckland's growth are reinforced in attitudes that reject egalitarianism, accept differential rewards and life styles, and are associated with distinctive political and social attitudes". On the evidence presented in this study it must be rejected.</field><field name="date">1985</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::360000 Policy and Political Science::360100 Political Science</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2002</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies in the biology of Phytophthora cinnamomi Rands</field><field name="creator">Chee, Kheng-Hoy</field><field name="description">1. Sixteen New Zealand and 10 overseas isolates of Phytophthora cinnamomi Rands have been compared for oospore production in paired and single cultures. Considerable variability existed among the 26 isolates in respect of mating ability and responses to physical and chemical factors. Addition of steroids and did not influence oospore production. However, hypoxanthine increased oospore production in two isolates. 2. Discovery of the role of steroids in relation to growth and asexual sporulation of Phytophthora ssp. makes it possible to replace natural media by a synthetic medium. For this purpose an investigation was made into the carbon, nitrogen, vitamin and calcium requirements of P. cinnamomi. Twenty carbon compounds were tested as major sources of carbon with Ca(NO3)2 and glutamic acid as nitrogen sources. Dextrin, starch, and sucrose were the best sources of carbon for growth and asexual reproduction. Xylose also supported abundant sporulation, although growth was slow. Organic acids and alcohols were poor sources of carbon. The best sources of organic nitrogen tested for growth were glutamine and glutamic acid. Tryptophan, phenyl-alanine, and cystine appeared to be inhibitory. Of the vitamins tested, only thiamine was required by the fungus. Five calcium compounds added singly to the basal medium gave no increase in the growth of the fungus. 3. &amp; 4. The effect of soil extracts on sporulation of P. cinnamomi has been investigated. Non-sterile soil extracts from different soil types and from soils under different plan species all supported sporulation, stimulatory activity being markedly reduced only after 1000-fold dilution. Autumn soil was most active in stimulating sporulation, wheras summer soil was inactive. When peptone was added to summer soil, the stimulatory activity of the extract was restored. A wide variety of materials added to distilled water failed to stimulate sporulation. Soil extract lost its stimulatory properties after sterilisation by autoclaving, steaming, Seitz or sintered glass filtration, dialysis, ultrasonic disintegration, ultracentrifugation or treatment with propylene oxide or alcohol. Root exudates and microorganisms other than bacteria had no effect on sporulation. Fifty-nine bacterial cultures classified in 15 genera stimulated sporulation on one or more occasions when transferred from nutrient broth cultures but not from nutrient agar slopes. Of 16 morphologically distinct bacteria isolated from wet autumn soil, two Pseudomonas species stimulated abundant sporulation when transferred from agar plates to sterile soil extract. The activity of these isolates was lost after six weeks in culture, but was partially restored by growing them in nutrient broth. Extracts from sterilised soil inoculated with attenuated cultures of these Pseudomonas species were stimulatory but subcultures from these extracts were only stimulatory if grown in broth. The difference in ability to stimulate sporulation between cultures from broth and from agar was not due to bacterial numbers, flagellation, or fimbriation, but was associated with the additional nutrient transferred with the bacterial inoculum from a broth culture. Streptomycin was the only one of several antibiotics tested which inhibited sporulation. Irrigation of P. cinnamomi mycelium with continuously-produced sterile filtrate from soil extracts produced sporangia in 48 hours.</field><field name="date">1966</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270300 Microbiology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2003</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The development and application of a modelling system for supporting managerial decision making</field><field name="creator">Cowie, Grant Crawford</field><field name="description">This thesis studies the potential role of formal models in providing support to the strategic-level decision processes within an organisation. Strategic activities are defined as being essentially outward looking and primarily concerned with the positioning of the organisation in its environment in the long term. The types of interaction which are of interest at this level are defined and a general mathematical framework is developed to describe these processes. Optimisation techniques which are potentially useful in the screening and evaluation of decision alternatives are also discussed. A collection of mathematical techniques will, however, remain only of theoretical interest. To be of practical assistance in the decision-making process they must be accessible to the decision maker. This can only be accomplished by means of a properly constructed computer system. A brief review of decision support systems, the field of study which is concerned with the application of computers to the decision making process, is followed by an investigation into the requirements that a computer system should fulfil if it is to be successful as a strategic-level decision aid. An overview is then given of "Stratagem", a computer system designed and built to integrate the mathematical modelling framework and the decision support concepts. Finally, two different applications of Stratagem are described to illustrate its potential role in strategic-level decision processes.</field><field name="date">1982</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350200 Business and Management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2004</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Coherent transient phenomena in the mode-locked argon laser</field><field name="creator">Dudley, John Michael</field><field name="description">An investigation has been carried out into the operation of a mode-locked argon laser at a wavelength of 514.5 nm and a repetition rate of 76.8 MHz. The characteristics of the pulses from the laser have been found to depend on the intra-cavity power level in the laser, and at average intra-cavity power levels exceeding 4 W, the pulses from the laser have a duration of typically 35 psec accompanied by a characteristic double-peaked spectrum with a spectral width of 13 GHz These pulse durations are approximately three times shorter than expected based on the inhomogeneously broadened transition bandwidth of 4 GHz. The dependence of the pulse characteristics on the intra-cavity power level has been explained by a model of pulse propagation where the coherent coupling between the pulse and the atomic polarisation in the laser gain medium is included. Detailed examination of the pulse structure reveals the presence of afterpulses that have a typical intensity two orders of magnitude lower than the main pulse. These afterpulses are interpreted as ringing arising from coherent Rabi-type oscillation of the atomic polarisation associated with the circulating pulse in the laser. Numerical simulations of the mode-locked laser have also been developed based on the fully coherent Maxwell-Bloch equations, and the results from the simulations reproduce well the experimentally observed variation in pulse characteristics. Based on results from the simulations, the short pulses observed at high intra-cavity powers are interpreted as the superfluorescent &#960; &#8211;pulse solutions predicted in the long distant limit of pulse propagation in a swept-gain amplifying medium. The laser operation has also been studied in a mode-locked cavity dumped configuration. In this case the combination of the coherent mode-locking processes described above with the cavity dumped operation at a repetition rate of 3.8 MHz results in the observation of stable pulses with peak power of 1.6 kW.</field><field name="date">1992</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::240000 Physical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2005</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Asymmetric syntheses of anthraquinonyl C-glycosides</field><field name="creator">Bercich, Mark David</field><field name="description">Syntheses of C2-anthraquinone aldehydes from the commercially available anthrarufin 11 have been investigated. A synthesis of the ketoaldehyde 5 in nine steps and 73% overall yield was achieved. Syntheses of 5 exploiting selective oxidations of either a C-bound allyl group via Wacker oxidation to introduce the methyl ketone functionality, or of a C-bound prop-l-enyl moiety via dihydroxylation and oxidative cleavage to generate the C2 formyl group were also developed. The aldehyde 81 was synthesised in seven steps and 81% overall yield from ll, and syntheses of the phenolic aldehydes 82, 95, and 96, the Cl benzyloxyaldehyde 104, and the anthracene aldehyde 107 have been developed. Hetero Diels-Alder reactions of several anthraquinone aldehydes with the dienes 6,120, and 121 using catalysis by the complex (+)-VO(hfc)2 115 were studied. Reactions of the aldehydes 5 and 81 proceeded readily using catalytic amounts of 115 and dichloromethane, chloroform, or toluene as solvent to give the adducts 128 or 131 indicating an endo selective pericyclic reaction pathway. The enantioselectivites of these reactions were typically 20-50%, with a best ee of 56% for a reaction between 81 and 6 catalysed by 0.2 equivalents of 115 at -78&#176;C. Reactions of the 1-silyloxydienes 120 and 121 with aldehyde 8l catalysed by 115 to give the enone 130 also proceeded readily with a best ee of 64% being obtained for a reaction between 81 and l2l in toluene at -78&#176;C. Reactions of the phenolic aldehydes 95 and 96 and the diene 6, catalysed by 115, afforded good yields of cycloadducts, but with enantioselectivities identical to equivalent reactions of the aldehyde 81. However reactions of the Cl benzyloxyaldehyde 104 with the dienes 6 and 120, and 121 afforded cycloadducts with enantioselectivities lower than those from the equivalent reactions of the aldehyde 81. Elaboration of the cycloadduct 131 to the anthracene C-glycoside 149 established that the hetero Diels-Alder reaction had favoured the formation of the 2'R, 6'R enantiomer of 131. This enantiofacial selectivity was correlated with the sense of anisochrony observed in 1H NMR spectra of the ketone 129, derived from 131, in the presence of the chiral solvating agent (S)(+)-trifluoroanthrylethanol. The enone 130 was elaborated to the anthraquinone-olivose C-glycoside 154 demonstrating the utility of hetero Diels-Alder reactions involving silyloxydienes with Cl silyloxy and Cl methyl substituents for such syntheses. Attempts to use chiral acyloxyborane comploxes such as 168 and 169 as catalysts for hetero Diels-Alder reactions of the aldehydes 5, 81 and 107 with the dienes 6 and 120 were unsuccessful. However two equivalents of the chiral acyloxyborane complex 168a in dichloromethane at 30&#176;C, mediated. a formal hetero Diels-Alder reaction between 81 and 120 affording the enone 13O in 45% yield, with a 79% ee in favour of the 6'R enantiomer. Reactions catalysed by the chiral acyloxyborane complex 169b between beenzaldehyde or o-anisaldehyde and the dienes 6,119, and 120 gave products resulting from a Mukaiyama aldol addition rather than a hetero Diels-Alder reaction. Hetero Diels-Alder reactions 81 and 120 employing the chiral titanium complexes Ti[(R)-BINOL]C12, Ti[(R)-BINOL]2, and Ti[R,R)-TADDOL]C12 were investigated. No reaction was observed when 0.5, 1.2 and 2 equivalents of Ti[(R)-BINOL]2 were used. However the complexes Ti[(R)-BINOL]C12 and Ti[(R,R)-TADDOL]C12 promoted the reaction between 81 and 120 at -30&#176;C and -78&#176;C, but induced low enantioselectivities (17-30%)</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2007</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Annulations of diterpenoids via organomanganese and organoiron complexes</field><field name="creator">Metzler, Michael Reinhold</field><field name="description">Chapter One of this Thesis reports an investigation of the synthesis of diterpenoids (as potential ligands for cyclomanganation reactions) from podocarpic acid, and one from dehydroabietic acid. A number of monocyclic aromatic and chalcone derivatives were synthesised to act as model compounds in the subsequent complexation reactions. The second chapter describes successful complexations of the above ligands containing aldehyde, ketone, ester, or oxime groups as directing functionalities to form the resulting tetracarbonylmanganese sigma adducts in moderate to excellent yield. Attempted complexation of amide-containing ligands proved generally to be unsuccessful. Complexation of ligands containing either two potential sites for manganation or two potential ligating groups were investigated and the structures of the isolated complexes established unequivocally by N.M.R. spectroscopy or by X-ray crystallography. Chapter Three describes the successful coupling reactions of the tetracarbonylmanganese complexes with ethene and with substituted electron-poor olefins to give pentaannulated derivatives of podocarpic acid in very good yields. The stereochemistry of two cyclised alcohols was assigned unambiguously by single-crystal X-ray diffraction experiments. Various methods of activating the tetracarbonyl complexes were investigated, including chemical oxidation, and palladium(II)-mediated or thermally-promoted reactions. Two of the pentaannulated adducts were converted successfully into benzannulated analogues in good yield. Analogous coupling reactions of the activated complexes with ethyne and substituted alkynes are discussed in Chapter Four. Chapter Five reports an investigation of the reactions of the tetracarbonylmanganese complexes with halogen electrophiles such as Br2, ICl, or ICl3. When these reactions were performed in non-protic solvents the corresponding aryl halides were isolated in moderate to excellent yield. However, in protic solvents carbonyl insertion occurred to afford &#947;-lactones in very good yield. The stereochemistry of one of these lactones was assigned unambiguously by a single-crystal X-ray diffraction experiment. Oxidative cleavage of the C-Mn bond with a number of reagents proved generally to be unsuccessful, the isolation of oxygenated diterpenoids being observed only from reaction with Pb(OAc)4. Chapter Six describes various attempts at functionalising ring C of podocarpic acid derivatives via alternative methods to cyclomanganation. These include an investigation into the formation of &#951;4-dienol ether and &#951;4-diene tricarbonyliron complexes derived from the Birch reduction products of podocarpic acid derivatives; attempted regioselective chlorination and mercuration studies of ring C arenes; functionalisation of chlorinated podocarpic acid derivatives via their tricarbonylchromium complexes; and attempted oxidation of ring C arenes with meta-chloroperbenzoic acid.</field><field name="date">1991</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2009</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Translation of New Zealand fiction into film</field><field name="creator">McDonnell, Brian</field><field name="description">This thesis explores the topic of literature-into-film adaptation by investigating the use of New Zealand fiction by film-makers in this country. It attempts this task primarily by examining eight case-studies of the adaptation process: five features designed for cinema release (Sleeping Dogs, A State of Siege, Sons for the Return Home, The Scarecrow and Other Halves), one feature-length television drama (the God Boy), and two thirty-minute television dramas (The Woman at the Store and Big Brother, Little Sister, from the series Winners and Losers). All eight had their first screenings in the ten-year period 1975-1985. For each of the case-studies, the following aspects are investigated: the original work of fiction, a practical history of the adaptation process (including interviews with people involved), and a study of changes made during the scripting and shooting stages. The films are analysed in detail, with a focus on visual and auditory style, in particular how these handle the themes, characterisation and style of the original works. Comparisons are made of the structures of the novels and the films. For each film, an especially close reading is offered of sample scenes (frequently the opening and closing scenes). The thesis is illustrated with still photographs &#8211; in effect, quotations from key moments &#8211; and these provide a focus to aspects of the discussion. Where individual adaptation problems existed in particular case-studies (for example, the challenge of the first-person narration of The God Boy), these are examined in detail. The interaction of both novels and films with the society around them is given emphasis, and the films are placed in their cultural and economic context - and in the context of general film history. For each film, the complex reception they gained from different groups (for example, reviewers, ethnic groups, gender groups, the authors of the original works) is discussed. All the aspects outlined above demonstrate the complexity of the responses made by New Zealand film-makers to the pressure and challenges of adaptation. They indicate the different answers they gave to the questions raised by the adaptation process in a new national cinema, and reveal their individual achievements.</field><field name="date">1986</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420200 Literature Studies::420201 New Zealand literature in English</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2010</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Out of mind, out of sight: unilateral spatial disorders in brain-damaged patients</field><field name="creator">Ogden, Jennifer Ann</field><field name="description">Hemineglect and unilateral extinction on double simultaneous stimulation in humans are neuropsychological disorders which sometimes follow a lesion to the cortex, subcortex or basal ganglia of one cerebral hemisphere. The main symptom is that the patient appears to neglect or be unaware of stimuli which impinge in one half of space relative to the patient's body. The side of space neglected is usually the side contralateral to the brain lesion. This thesis comprises a collection of studies on various aspects of these disorders. Experimental subjects were patients in the Neurology and Neurosurgical Wards of Auckland Hospital. All had clearly defined solitary unilateral brain lesions confirmed by Computerized Tomography. Chapter 1 provides a historical review of research in the area, defines concepts, reviews recent human and animal research on hemineglect and extinction, and outlines the different theories which have been proposed in order to explain hemineglect. Chapter 2 describes the methods used in neuropsychological testing, the criteria used in the selection of subjects, the etiologies of the different types of lesions sustained by the patient sample, and the neuropsychological tests used in the various studies. Chapter 3 is a study of the incidence and severity of visual hemineglect in a group of 56 patients with left-hemispheric lesions and 45 patients with right-hemispheric lesions. Five paper and pencil tests designed to measure the presence and severity of visual hemineglect were given to these patients. The incidence of hemineglect in the two groups did not differ significantly (50% and 44% in the left and right brain-damaged groups respectively). However, visual hemineglect was found to be more severe after right- than after left-hemispheric lesions. The two groups were found to differ significantly with respect to the loci of lesions most likely to result in hemineglect. In the right brain-damaged group most patients with hemineglect had posterior lesions, and in the left brain-damaged group most patients with hemineglect had anterior lesions. Possible reasons for this are discussed in terms of the effects the lateralization of language representation might have on the representation of spatial functions. Chapter 4 describes an experiment designed to determine whether patients with unilateral cerebral lesions neglect the contralesional sides of their mental images of the external world. This phenomenon has previously been observed for patients with left-sided visual neglect following right-hemispheric lesions. Twenty control subjects and 16 patients with right- and left-hemispheric lesions were involved in the experiment reported in this chapter. In the 'static' condition they viewed pairs of complex shapes displayed, one shape at a time, on a video-screen controlled by a computer. In the 'dynamic' condition the pairs of shapes apparently moved, one at a time, behind a narrow vertical slit. In both conditions the subject had to decide whether the two shapes of each pair were the same or different. In fact, some were the same, while some differed on the right and others on the left. In the 'dynamic' condition subjects had to construct spatial images from non-spatial external stimuli before they could make a same/different response. Both right and left brain-damaged groups demonstrated a significant neglect of the contralesional sides of their images of the shapes in that they often gave 'same' responses when the shapes actually differed on their contralesional sides. This had implications for normal imagery processes. It appears that at some advanced stage our images are mapped onto our hemispheres in an analogue fashion. That is, objects or parts of objects that we imagine to be on our left are mapped onto our right hemispheres, and those parts we imagine to be on our right are mapped onto our left hemispheres. If one hemisphere is damaged at a site which is essential to this imagery process, the contralateral half of the external stimulus that is being imagined will be degraded or neglected. Chapter 5 is a study of auditory extinction in unilaterally brain-damaged patients. In particular the phenomenon of ipsilateral auditory extinction is investigated in detail. Previous researchers have found ipsilateral auditory extinction for dichotically presented verbal stimuli following lesions only of the posterior left hemisphere. It has been hypothesized that a lesion in this area disconnects a posteriorly routed interhemispheric auditory pathway and that as a consequence, left-ear verbal input is unable to reach the left (speech) hemisphere. In Experiment 1, I tested 53 brain-damaged patients for extinction of digits on a dichotic listening task and found that patients with lesions wholly anterior to the central sulcus in the left hemisphere exhibited ipsilateral extinction as well as patients with posterior left-hemispheric lesions. This finding poses problems for the above hypothesis that relies on a posterior inter-hemispheric pathway, and alternatives to this hypothesis are discussed. In Experiment 2, I tested 16 patients for extinction of dichotically presented non-verbal material (tones) to ascertain whether ipsilateral extinction is restricted to verbal tasks. Ipsilateral extinction was not found on this task for either left or right brain-damaged patients. This suggested not only that ipsilateral auditory extinction is related to the disconnection or disruption of left-ear verbal input from the left (speech) hemisphere, but that the right hemisphere is not essential for the decoding and processing of non-verbal material. That is, I did not find right-ear ipsilateral extinction for non-verbal input in patients with right-hemispheric lesions. Chapter 6 is the study of multimodal hemineglect and extinction in patients with right- and left-hemispheric lesions. Clinical observations suggest that multimodal neglect may be a single disorder with a common underlying cause, and that the number of modalities affected is dependent upon the severity of the underlying deficit. For example, patients with hemiasomatagnosia (body hemineglect) are often observed to exhibit visual hemineglect and tactile extinction as well. I tested 50 patients for contralesional visual hemineglect, auditory extinction, tactile extinction and hemiasomatagnosia and computed phi correlation coefficients for pairs of disorders to see if there was any basis for supposing they were caused by the same underlying deficit. As the proportion of patients with hemineglect varied widely from modality to modality, possibly as a result of varying sensitivities of the tests used to measure the different forms of neglect, I also computed tetrachoric correlation coefficients. This measure corrects for varying proportions on the assumption that a normal distribution underlies each dichotomy. The results were inconclusive as the phi-coefficients were generally low and the tetrachoric coefficients very high. Because of the extreme difference between the two forms of correlation it was not possible to come to any conclusions about the 'true' correlations. It may be that at least some forms of hemineglect and extinction are independent of one another and are often found together in the same patients because the lesions overlap modality-specific areas, rather than because they result from the same underlying cause. Chapters 7 summarizes the studies described in Chapters 3, 4, 5 and 6, and the results are reviewed in the light of some of the more important theories of hemineglect.</field><field name="date">1983</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::320700 Neurosciences::320799 Neurosciences not elsewhere classified</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2011</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Performance in multiple schedules</field><field name="creator">Charman, Lesle Frances</field><field name="description">Four experiments are reported. Each experiment investigated a different variable which at sometime has been thought to influence performance in multiple schedules. Variable-interval schedules were used in all experiments and twelve pigeons served as subjects, six in the first two experiments and six in the third and fourth. The parametric data provided by each experiment were analysed using the generalized matching law and comparisons with findings in concurrent-schedule research were made. In Experiment 1 the effects of component durations and component reinforcer rates on multiple-schedule performance were investigated. Component duration did not affect sensitivity to the ratios of reinforcer rates. In Experiment 2 the effects of food deprivation and component reinforcer rates on multiple-schedule performance were investigated. Sensitivity to the ratios of reinforcer rates increased as deprivation was reduced. However, the data could only be explained by a model which assumed no direct component interaction. In Experiment 3 the discriminability of the stimuli customarily used in multiple-schedule research was investigated. The stimuli were perfectly discriminable. It was shown that the undermatching of response and reinforcer ratios typical of multiple-schedule performance was not the result of a failure to discriminate the stimuli signalling the components. In Experiment 4, a procedure for investigating time allocation in multiple schedules was introduced. The birds could switch in to the component in effect, and the components alternated at three minute intervals. Each switch in to a component gave acess to the schedule in effect for fixed brief periods. Ratios of component response rates showed typical multiple-schedule undermatching. However, a commonality in concurrent and multiple-schedule performance was revealed in respect to local or switched-in response rates. In both types of schedule, it appears that pigeons allocate time so as to equalize the local response rates. It is apparent that the differences reported between concurrent and multiple-schedules with respect to the sensitivity with which responses are distributed between the components as a function of the distribution of reinforcers are a result of the constraints imposed on the subjects' allocation of time in multiple schedules.</field><field name="date">1983</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2013</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Parameters of Self Concept Self Efficacy and Programme Enrichment</field><field name="creator">Rawlinson, Catherine</field><field name="description">In this study a unique Enrichment Programme was designed, based upon the four curriculum models of Renzulli, Betts, Treffinger and Feldhusen. Pedagogical strategies to reinforce the development of children&#8217;s academic self concept internal locus of control, self efficacy and demonstration of potential special abilities formed an integral part of this Enrichment Programme. Instead of pre-selecting children to participate in the Enrichment Programme, this study explored the effects of changing the direction of the identification process for Children with Special Abilities. As a result, all children in the Treatment classes participated in varying stages of enrichment. The theory underpinning this intervention design was based upon Bandura's theory of reciprocal determinism and his principle of bi-directionality. In this study a pre/post experimental design was used with both the Treatment and Control groups. Seven inner city Auckland Primary schools were randomly selected to take part in this study. The Treatment group consisted of four Standards 2-4 classes, the Control group consisted of three Standards 2-4 classes. During intervention the Treatment group worked with their teachers who also attended two introductory workshops relating to the Enrichment Programme. The Control group did not participate in the Enrichment Programme; instead they worked on their regular class programme. Measures of children&#8217;s general academic self concept, locus of control and self efficacy were obtained using three questionnaires. Teachers in the Treatment and Control groups also completed an adapted version of the Renzulli/Hartman Special Ability Scale, for each child in their class at the beginning and end of the intervention phase. When combining scores for all areas measured, MANOVA showed that following intervention there was a difference between the Treatment and Control group results but this difference was not significant at the .05 level. MANOVA showed that a significant Ability effect occurred in this study regardless of whether the children were in the Treatment or Control groups. Ethnic and SES differences were also obtained but these were not significant. ANOVA using Split Plot Design for Repeated Measures focused upon the separate scores in each of the cognitive/personal and behaviour performance areas measured. In Perception of General Academic Ability neither the Treatment nor Control group made a significant increase, however a significant Ability effect was obtained. The Treatment and Control groups did not make significant increase in any of the five areas of Locus of Control and there were no significant Ability, Ethnic or SES effects in this area. The Control group made a significant increase in Self Efficacy and a significant SES effect was obtained. The Treatment group made a highly significant increase in Teachers&#8217; Recognition of Children with Special Abilities and significant Ability and SES effects were also obtained in this area. A number of Treatment groups made increases which approached significance in the area of Teachers&#8217; Recognition of Children with Special Abilities. This study illustrates that it is possible to design a class-based Enrichment Programme which enables all children to participate in varying stages of enrichment and which incorporates pedagogical strategies to reinforce academic self concept. The self efficacy results confirm Bandura&#8217;s premise that reciprocal influences do not occur simultaneously and that it takes time for a causal factor to exert its influence. This study shows that changing the direction of the identification process, by including all children in a class-based Enrichment Programme can be an effective strategy for enhancing Teachers&#8217; Recognition of Special Abilities for children from different Ability, Ethnic and SES groups.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2014</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Potential precursors to the development of phonological awareness in preschool children</field><field name="creator">Arrow, Alison Wendy</field><field name="description">Phonological awareness is one of the most important metacognitive skills needed for literacy development. However, the relationships between preschool phonological awareness and pre-literacy skills are only just beginning to be examined. An important area is the study of potential precursors to phonological awareness. The current research proposed that phonological awareness develops along a continuum of linguistic awareness beginning with syllables and moving towards the smallest level of the phoneme. In the current research, potential precursors were examined in two studies. The first study was an examination of preschool phonological awareness in a sample of 110 New Zealand four-year-old children with no formal literacy instruction but who had a range of pre-literacy skills including 12 children who could read one or more words. The second study examined how literacy instruction influenced the development of phoneme awareness by independently assessing the role of learning to read and the role of learning to spell by teaching non-readers to read 8 CVC words or to spell the same 8 CVC words, but not to read and spell. The results found that rime and phoneme awareness both contributed to a latent variable of phonological awareness and that they each had different potential precursors. Receptive vocabulary explained the most variance in rime awareness with a small association of letter-name knowledge and own-name spelling while rime awareness developed more in children who learnt new words in the intervention. Rime awareness contributed to phoneme awareness along with letter-sound knowledge. When children were taught to read using blending this led to task specific phoneme awareness gains only. Phoneme awareness did not contribute to word-learning in the experimental conditions, with the only learning occurring in the spelling conditions. Letter-name knowledge had a relationship with the acquisition of orthographic representations. Letter-sound knowledge had a relationship with phoneme and letter-level attempts at unfamiliar words. This suggests that children with good letter-name and letter-sound knowledge have both orthographic knowledge and alphabetic strategies available in early word reading and spelling. Results are discussed in terms of their theoretical and practical implications emphasising the role of alphabet knowledge in early literacy acquisition.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2362</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Global Capitalism and the Revival of Ethnic Traditionalism in New Zealand: The Emergence of Tribal-Capitalism</field><field name="creator">Rata, Elizabeth , 1952-</field><field name="description">The social and economic restructuring accompanying increasing globalisation has provided new opportunities and new limits for social and ethnic movements in New Zealand as elsewhere. The purpose of this thesis is to establish the theory of tribal-capitalism through an examination of the responses to these changing global economic circumstances that have characterised the Maori ethnification, indigenisation and retribalisation movements since the 1970s. Although both the initial 'prefigurative' and the later 'strategic'(Breines, 1980:421) routes to tino rangatiratanga ('Maori sovereignty') were attempts to restore traditional social relations and secure political and economic autonomy from the dominant Pakeha society, the projects are distinguished by different approaches. On the one hand the 'prefigurative' traditionalist project indicted both capitalism and Pakeha society as its exponents sought a return to the precapitalist social relations of the pre-Contact era. On the other hand exponents of the 'strategic' project sought to establish a concordat with capitalist Pakeha society based upon the assumption that a capitalist economy could be made compatible with Maori political and cultural autonomy. It is argued that neither project, 'prefigurative' traditionalism nor the 'strategic march through the institutions of capitalism', achieved the objective of tino rangatiratanga. Irrespective of approach, Maori ethnification, indigenisation and retribalisation became reshaped and reconstituted by the conditions that made the movements possible and that shaped them in decisive ways. These tino rangatiratanga movements emerged from the institutional channels enabled by Pakeha bicultural idealists and given substance by the Waitangi Tribunal as a tribal-capitalist regime of accumulation characterised by exploitative class relations and reified communal relations. An extensive range of case studies is employed to provide evidence that tests the hypothesis of the emergence of tribal-capitalism from out of the projects that attempted to retain the traditional in a world dominated by capitalist relations. Despite the structural opportunities provided by Pakeha bicultural idealists, and despite the different approaches of the Maori tino rangatiratanga projects, it was not possible to restore communal relations of production. Objective forces, rather than internal miscalculation, ineptitude or corruption, brought about the failure as firstly 'prefigurative' and then 'strategic' projects became doomed attempts to sidestep class location within capitalist structures. The various studies examine the ways in which the 'prefigurative' and 'strategic' projects not only led to the transformation of the ethnification and indigenisation movements into the new class formations of tribal-capitalism, but actually became constitutive of the class fractions that define the regime. The dialectical interactive of agency and structure which transformed the projects became a reconstituting and shaping mechanism of change. First the study of the Pakeha new class's bicultural project grounds the later studies by locating the institutional inclusion of Maori indigenous particularity in the universalism of the new class humanists. Biculturalism established relatively benign conditions for the tino rangatiratanga projects by providing both opportunities and resources for Maori development. It is in the retribalising form of that development that an indigenous version of the capitalist regime of accumulation is located. The next three sections of the thesis examine the 'prefigurative' and 'strategic' routes of this indigenous particularity into the new inclusive structures in studies of: a reviving Maori family, an ascendant tribe, a separate Maori education system and the creation of the national Maori fishing industry. The outcomes of each study are examined to trace the failure of both approaches as particular groups within the retribalisation movement developed new and exclusive relationships to the traditional lands, waters and knowledge. The concluding section contrasts culturalist theories of the Maori tino rangatiratanga projects with the hypothesis of the emergence of tribal-capitalism advanced in this thesis. The claim that cultural strength can resist the imposition of capitalist class relations is found not to be sustained.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::379900 Other Studies In Human Society::379902 Indigenous studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2015</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The PPTA and the State: from militant professionals to bargaining agent : a study of rational opportunism</field><field name="creator">Jesson, Jocelyn Gavin</field><field name="description">This thesis using oral historiographic techniques examines the changing role and function of a teachers' union during changes in the nature of a national State which can also be related to changing forms of capitalism. The teachers' union is New Zealand Post-Primary Teachers Association (the secondary school teachers' union) and the period of particular focus is between 1983 and the beginning of 1993. This is the period of a crisis in the New Zealand State during which the character of the national State was moved from what has been described as a 'wage earners' Welfare State towards a more residual form providing a 'modest safety net'. The financial and the labour market were deregulated to become more free of direct State involvement. The administration of education was changed and the individual schools' elected Boards of Trustees were made responsible for the provision of schooling. The role of PPTA in the State is moved structurally in this time. As a professional association before the changes, PPTA had both opportunity for input into the mandate of education, as well as the possibility of creating implementation pressure through political action. As a bargaining agent, the input role of PPTA to decisions in education was limited to addressing members' concerns at the school level. The restructuring of education and of the labour market, PPTA was both an object to be acted on and a participant obstructing the changes. This thesis presents what is a PPTA view of those changes. PPTA formed a central part of the education structures which were to be transformed by the economic liberal project. The survival of PPTA demonstrates the extent to which the project was not completed and the resistance of PPTA was one of the reasons why the project in education could not be completed. The thesis is in three parts. Part one is a regulationist-derived periodisation of the historical development of the New Zealand wage earners Welfare State and education. This is followed by a consideration of the economic-liberal challenge to this State Part two considers the development of PPTA's professional project and the possibilities presented through different arenas. Part three focuses on the changing nature of the State labour market policy and PPTA's activity in that. The changing strategies and tactics of PPTA's 'professional project', the thesis argues, occur under changing political conditions and are an example of Offe's concept of rational opportunism</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2016</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Transition metal clusters in zeolites</field><field name="creator">Yong, You Sing, 1958-</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">1987</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2017</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Some Aspects of N.M.R. Spectroscopy and of Rearrangement Mechanisms</field><field name="creator">Baker, Kenneth Matthew</field><field name="description">Part 1. Some aspects of NMR spectroscopy: A review of coupling mechanisms is given and notable examples of long range coupling in the literature are discussed. Methyl protons can undergo long range coupling with protons which are 4s bonds away, and the mechanism of this process as related to the known examples is discussed. The effects of electronegative substituents on long range coupling is also outlined.  A Discussion of the present work follows, wherein the description of the preparation of many bornane derivatives, including several deuterated derivatives, is presented. The line widths (Wh/2) of the methyl groups were measured. It was found that the width of the methyl groups decreased in the order C8&gt;C9&gt;C10, and the C8 and C9 methyl signals were always appreciably broader than the C10. Long range coupling between the protons of the C8 and C9 methyl groups is postulated as being responsible for those two being broader than C10. Long range coupling between the C8 methyl protons and the C5 and C6 endo protons, and between the C9 methyl and the C3 endo proton is tentatively ascribed to the differences in the widths of the C8 and C9 methyl groups. Although the line widths of the tertiary methyls were found to vary with solvent, the relative widths of the three methyl signals of the bornane derivatives was found to be the same. Thus measurement of line widths is a method of correlating the methyl signals in spectra run in different solvents. The effects on the chemical shifts of the tertiary methyl groups of bornanes when various substituents are placed in the basic skeleton, is also described. The presence of an ethylenedioxy group at C2 or C3 results in a desheilding of C8 and a shielding of C9, while introduction of hydroxyl groups has no uniform effect because of different orientations of the hydroxyl group from compound to compound.  An introduction to the mechanism of benzene induced solvent shifts is given. Benzene appears to form a stereospecific complex with ketones, and other molecules, which can undergo a dipole-induced dipole-interaction. The effects of this interaction on the n.m.r. spectra of various ketones, quinones and aromatic compounds is described. The present work describes the measurement of solvent shifts at various concentrations of ketones and ketals in benzene. Previous similar work is discussed in the light of the results obtained, and it has been shown that some assumptions previously used in correlating the data with the interactions, have been unjustified. The solvent shifts versus the concentration have been plotted to give curves which have been interpreted as indicating specific solvent-solute interactions, i.e. 1:1, 1:2, etc., and not random associations. This has been shown by comparing calculated curves with the experimental results, with which agreement is good. The third part of this section of the work deals with the spectra of some hydroxymethylene ketones, and commences with an introduction to the general behaviour of 1,3-diketones in solution. The rates of exchange of enolizable protons is discussed, and their use in determining the relative proportions of enol forms is outlined. The present work describes the behaviour of 3-formylbornan-2-one in carbontetrachloride-D2O solution, and an explanation for the preference for one enol form is given. Also discussed is the coupling between &#8216;formyl&#8217; and hydroxyl protons in hydroxymethylene ketones, and it is shown that the coupling depends strongly on the H-O-C-H angle, which can be altered by slight changes in molecular geometry, thus leading to changes in coupling constants. No change in coupling constants caused by temperature differences was observed, and it is speculated that exchange processes do not affect the value of the coupling constant, but only whether coupling occurs. Part 2: Acid catalysed rearrangements in cyclic systems  A comprehensive review of the dienone-phenol rearrangement is given and it is shown that any cross-conjugated cyclohexadienone will rearrange to an aromatic product, the substitution of which depends strongly on (i) the substitution pattern of the original dienone, (ii) peculiarities in the molecular structure, and (iii) the rearrangement conditions. Rearrangements of some dienols and some cross-conjugated methylenecyclohexadienes or &#8216;semibenzenes&#8217; are described, and in general these follow the pattern of the dienone-phenol rearrangement. Rearrangement of some steroidal &#945;-substituted ketones is also mentioned briefly. Two cross-conjugated methylenecyclohexadienes were synthesised by reaction of methylmagnesium iodide on the corresponding dienones &#8211; this reaction had previously been reported to give only the products of rearrangement of the intermediate semibenzenes. The semibenzenes were rearranged using perchloric acid in acetic anhydride-ethyl acetate to give the 1,4-disubstituted aromatic product. The attacking species was shown to be a proton, and the reaction, unlike the dienone-phenol rearrangement, showed a clear preference for methylene rather than methyl migration. Several methyl substituted steroidal 2&#945;-hydroxy-4-en-3-ones were prepared by the rearrangement of the corresponding 4,5-epoxy-3-ones with sulphuric acid in aqueous acetone, herein shown to be a general method. The hydroxyenones were rearranged using three sets of conditions: Toluene-p-sulphonic acid in methanol, toluene-p-sulphonic acid in benzene, and perchloric acid in acetic anhydride-ethyl acetate. Only one compound, 2&#945;-hydroxycholest-4-en-3-one gave an aromatic product; the other substrates underwent rearrangement through the various enols, to give attack usually at C6 of the carbon skeleton. A mechanism is given and discussed for each rearrangement. No general pattern seemed to emerge.  Part 3: The Clemmensen reduction of 1,3-diketones  A review of the Clemmensen reduction is given with a specific reference to reduction of difunctional compounds, where rearrangements may occur. The present work shows that in the Clemmensen reduction of 1,3-diketones, the intermediate cyclopropanediol which is first formed, undergoes acidolysis to give an &#945;-hydroxy ketone and a &#946;-hydroxy ketone, each of which may then undergo further Clemmensen reduction to give the observed rearranged and unrearranged monoketones. The intermediacy of a &#946;-hydroxy ketone was proved by observing the rate of formation of the products, and by measuring the rate of reduction of an independently synthesised &#945;-hydroxy ketone. Reduction of two acyclic ketones was shown to give a ring expanded product only in the case of 2-acetylcyclopentanone. Part 4: Intramolecular hydrogen abstraction reactions from aromatic alkyl groups  A short resume of intramolecular hydrogen reactions using lead tetraacetate or the hypoiodite process is given, with some detail being applied to the conditions, and the stereochemistry needed for the reaction, and to fragmentation processes which may occur. Brief mention is also made of the new reaction; hydrogen abstraction using decomposition of a hypobromite with silver ions. The lead tetraacetate reaction was applied without success to abstraction of hydrogen from an aromatic methyl group, utilizing an &#945;-benzylic hydroxyl group. Fragmentation reactions were generally obtained. Application of the bromine-silver ion method gave good yields of cyclic ethers in two cases, indicating that an abstraction reaction had taken place. The conditions for such a reaction seem to be critical: A tertiary hydroxyl group is required, and the abstraction seems only to take place from a primary centre.</field><field name="date">1968</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2018</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Identity, difference and politics: a poststructuralist investigation</field><field name="creator">Chueh, Ho-chia</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates the ways in which concepts of binary opposition are elaborated in some of the key contemporary theories on difference and identity. This project contributes to the emerging scholarship on the notion of emancipation and empowerment in educational theory. It explores discourses of difference and identity that are engaged with constructions and re-construction of the notions of Self and Other. This thesis develops a systematic analysis of texts with arguments on political performance of representation and agency. The thesis begins with an examination of Hegel's thesis on the relationship between the lord and the bondsman which is implemented in the political discourses of John Rex and Paulo Freire. It continues to examine political theses with emphasis on the relationship between the mind and the body; examinations include theses offered by Robert Miles and Frantz Fanon. This thesis also explores the methodological value of concepts of binary opposition; it explores Claude L&#233;vi-Strauss' theory on cultural differences and examines Iris M. Young and Chantal Mouffe's discourses on the 'politics of difference'. This thesis further explores Jacques Derrida's notions of deconstruction and diff&#233;rence together with analyses and critiques of Homi Bhabha's and Gayatri Spivak's reconstruction of concepts of binary oppositions. This thesis calls for a consideration of Derrida's thoughts on the political as an approach to the understanding difference and identity. I propose a double reading of the texts examined in this thesis: on the one hand, they are genealogical analyses to understand and criticise the ways in which knowledge on (racial and cultural) difference and identity have been constructed. On the other hand, they are given affirmations of political significance with their performative effectiveness that language allows them to achieve.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education::330100 Education Studies::330101 Educational psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2019</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Maori Settlement on South Kaipara Peninsula</field><field name="creator">Spring-Rice, Wynne</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370300 Anthropology</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420300 Cultural Studies::420306 Maori cultural studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2020</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Rhetoric of mysticism</field><field name="creator">Adams, Peter James</field><field name="description">Research into mystical experience has to date relied primarily on retrospective self reports of mystical states. Analysis of such reports assumes a direct correspondence between their content and the content of the experiences. But experiencers themselves often express dissatisfaction with the capacity of language to convey these states, and the language they do choose to use is typically vague and ambiguous. The current dissertation argues that vagueness is not an accidental nor an unfortunate feature of mystical communications. Because of difficulties in direct expression, mystical communicators rely on the active and imaginative participation of the listener/reader to complete the expression. A theory of provocative gaps is developed to explain how this operates. A "gap" is conceived of as an open receptacle in linguistic space. It provides a site within a discourse upon which receptive listeners/readers can insert content from their own experience. Gaps can be created by blatant omissions of content, but in written descriptions are more likely to occur in indirect forms by exploiting subtleties in grammar and meaning. A simple diagrammatic system is developed for explaining the gap-provoking potential of several major rhetorical strategies. Three studies were designed to explore whether and at what frequency written testimonials of mystical experience exploit a selection of 31 of these gap-provoking strategies: the first study exposed their high frequency in extracts by well-known published mystics; the second indicated similarly high frequencies for the average person's description; and the third found significantly higher rates in mystical testimonials than in descriptions by the same participants of dream or travel experiences. A similar use of vagueness can be found in the language of hypnotic trance induction, and as an adjunct to the second study, the hypnotic susceptibility of 81 subjects was assessed and results indicated that subjects with mystical inclinations were more susceptible to hypnosis than those without. The general support of the studies for a theory of provocative gaps suggests that the notion of intentional vagueness could have useful application in the study of other types of communication, including: the media, art criticism, teaching, psychotherapy and academic discourse.</field><field name="date">1991</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2021</field></doc><doc><field name="title">From the Eccentric to the Essential: a Study of Hardy's Imagery and his Debt to the Visual Arts</field><field name="creator">Batten, Juliet</field><field name="description">Hardy&#8217;s visual imagery reveals both the eye of the draughtsman and the eye of the artist.

Despite the large audience he reached in his own time, and the interest he aroused in a number of later poets and novelists, Maturin's work has not received very much serious attention from critics. The present study attempts to take a fresh look at all Maturin's work, exploring it sympathetically from a variety of directions. Melmoth is included, but because it has dominated previous discussion of Maturin, I have chosen to concentrate on his neglected novels, Fatal Revenge, The Wild Irish Boy, The Milesian Chief, Women, or Pour et Contre, and The Albigenses. Special attention is given here to Maturin's two volumes of sermons (a valuable but seldom used source of information about his religious philosophy) and, more generally, to the theme of religion, which links many of his novels. This aspect of Gothic literature deserves a closer study than it usually receives, particularly in the work of Maturin who was a minister of religion. My thesis proposes a new interpretation of Fatal Revenge based on the parallel that Maturin developed between the use of superstition by Orazio and its use by the Catholic church. In The Albigenses there is a similar parallel between the outlaws and the supposedly holy Crusaders. Maturin took the Catholic church so often as his subject, not simply because it provided a colourful, stereotyped background (as some have suggested), but because it was a context in which he could seriously investigate the psychological pressures that produced (and still produce) conformity, extremism, and sexual violence. While his studies of oppressive societies may at times remind us of twentieth-century works such as 1984 or The Trial, Maturin's fiction is very much a part of its age. After a chapter that explores the history of 'the Gothic', my thesis focuses on the particular context of Maturin's period, mapping it initially by examining the responses to his work that appeared in print during his lifetime. Those reviews and essays make visible the complex field of forces in which Maturin worked. The Gothic novel developed in an age of more than usual ferment - literary, religious, and political - including the first phase of what we would today describe as feminist rebellion. All this was accompanied, as we can see from the criticism, by a strong conservative reaction in defence of the threatened values. The present study emphasizes the ways in which Maturin's work shared the new energies associated with change, even though it also displayed signs of ambivalence. I consider the reasons for this ambivalence and argue that in many cases there is subtlety in what appears at first to be confusion. Maturin's fiction was a late addition to the Gothic tradition, but its particular kinds of complexity - such as its psychological depth - made it an important development of the genre and linked it with other innovative writing of the period. Some admirers of Maturin have sought to play down the Gothic element in his work, which is understandable in view of the low esteem in which the genre has been held. The Gothic has often been seen, for example, as a confused rehearsal for Romanticism. While acknowledging the variety of Maturin's novels, I have sought to emphasise their continuing links with the Gothic genre and its special energies. During the past decade, new forms of Gothic criticism have appeared that treat the subject with greater seriousness. Today, interest in the Gothic genre seems to be springing to life again, and its relevance to our own time (which is also a period of complex social change and widespread ambivalence) has become clearer. I have attempted to contribute to this new type of criticism by pointing out the value of Maturin's studies of oppression and his ability to go beyond stereotypes in his treatment of women characters. I have also suggested some links between Gothic literature and feminist science-fiction writing today. In general, the aim of this thesis has been to consider the most mature Gothic fiction (such as that of Maturin) not merely as fantasy but as an expanded vision of reality.</field><field name="date">1983</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420100 Language Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2024</field></doc><doc><field name="title">New patches on old cloth: some New Zealand Catholic lay women&#8217;s experiences of overseas mission 1963-2002</field><field name="creator">Atkinson, Diana Mary</field><field name="description">New Zealand Catholic lay women have actively participated in overseas missionary work for over forty years. From the 1960s, the Catholic Overseas Volunteer Organization (COVS), under the auspices of the New Zealand bishops, enabled lay women to respond to missionary bishops&#8217; requests for assistance. Overseas, they worked in a range of mission stations with a variety of religious orders. Their experiences are the focus of this study. Their stories have not been told previously and part of the intent is to make their work visible, particularly, to add to the histories of New Zealand women, Catholic women and Christian missionary women more generally. This thesis contends that their overseas experiences were far from partnership and collaboration and have subsequently failed to provide opportunities for wider participation in the New Zealand Church. Vatican documents, archival material, interviews with fifty ex-volunteers and the two lay women directors of the organization provide the data for this thesis. Feminist theology forms the theoretical base and narrative analysis the interpretive tool. There were three volunteer cohorts: young, single volunteers, mothers with dependent children and older women. Most volunteers grew up in the 1950s and 1960s, came from Catholic homes, attended Catholic schools and were actively involved in New Zealand parishes. Overseas, the women continued lives of faith and service, contributing needed and valuable skills. Many younger women enjoyed professional opportunities and their missionary community. It was harder to fit in to a mission station as Catholic mothers or older women and many found it difficult to establish a missionary identity, to be accepted as part of the team. In all groups, there was great satisfaction when experiences matched expectations. The missionary insights and/or skills of these ex-volunteers have generally not been sought by their New Zealand parishes and they are, for the most part, an unappreciated and neglected resource. Lay women&#8217;s experiences of overseas mission point to a need for change &#8211; lay women seek not only to participate but to be valued partners in their Church.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::440000 Philosophy and Religion::440200 Religion and Religious Traditions</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2025</field></doc><doc><field name="title">'A Toaster with Pictures': The Deregulation of Broadcasting in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Cocker, Alan</field><field name="description">'A toaster with pictures' was the characterisation of television by the former chairman of the United States Federal Communications Commission and advocate of broadcasting deregulation, Mark Fowler. It encapsulates the view of the neo-liberal reformers who set about to deregulate broadcasting as part of the wide-ranging economic attack on the structures of state regulation. Broadcasting was a consumer industry like any other. It conformed to the rules of economic behaviour and performed at its optimum in an environment of a free market.    This thesis traces the deregulation of broadcasting in New Zealand from its theoretical origins, to its adoption by policy advisors of the New Zealand Treasury, and its legislative enactment by the Government in the late l980s and early 1990s. But the account also traverses wider than those narrow boundaries. It is argued that in order to understand why this country undertook such a thoroughgoing reform of the broadcasting sector it is necessary to look at its history and account for the apparent wholesale rejection of the previous structures which were portrayed as regulated public service broadcasting.    It is also essential to the story of broadcasting deregulation in New Zealand to determine why this country was a pathfinder of reform. The essential conditions which enabled the speedy implementation of the policy whilst in other nations the reform process in broadcasting was stalled, only partially implemented, or rejected. The comparative overview also brings into focus the arguments of the opponents of deregulating this &#8216;particular' or 'peculiar' industry with its social and cultural role in society.    As New Zealand was the first nation deliberately to enact the deregulation of broadcasting, the final sections of the thesis look at the 'model' and assess its impact. The reforms have led to a new marketplace of broadcasting in which the audience is viewed as consumers rather than citizens. The dismantling of the social contract in broadcasting between the state and citizens and its replacement by supposedly individual contracts between broadcasters and consumers is, it is suggested, dysfunctional for democratic civil society.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::360000 Policy and Political Science::360100 Political Science</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2026</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physiological and Biochemical Adaptation in the Nitrogen Nutrition of Spirodela Oligorrhiza</field><field name="creator">Ferguson, A.

The first phase of the research was the construction of a theoretical model to incorporate the impacts of quality on manufacturing performance, manufacturing productivity and business performance. The relationships of the model are based on the quality management literature. The second phase of the research was the design and administration of a survey instrument for the collection of empirical performance data. The data were then used to evaluate the relationships represented in the model. The final phase of the research used structural equations modelling in order to evaluate the relationships of the model. Quality was found to have significant and positive impacts on operational performance measures for process utilization, process output, production costs, work-in-process inventory levels and on-time delivery rate. The analysis found that change in quality level was most strongly associated with change in process utilization. The findings for the impacts of quality on operational performance were compatible with the quality management literature. The impacts of quality on business performance given by structural equations analysis were significant and positive for productivity-induced improvements of quality. Generally, the support for the impacts of quality on business performance which occur through other aspects of, operational performance was not significant.

Many aspects of school governance were devolved from a central government bureaucracy to Boards of Trustees at each school and greater choice of school was given to parents. In this thesis I examine the assumptions underlying these policy changes and propose a model of the processes necessary for the development of school responsiveness. The research progressed over four phases. In the first I survey beliefs and practices in 38 Auckland schools about the new school-community partnership established by the devolution of governance responsibility to the Boards of Trustees. This survey was followed by a second more extensive questionnaire survey on the same topic in ten of these schools. The role educational values might play in parents' choice of school and their perceptions of school responsiveness were addressed in a survey of five secondary schools in the second phase. The third phase comprised case studies of two schools which had contrasting community-school relationships. In one school the principal valued a close partnership with the community, yet the school roll had fallen steadily over a five year period. In the other school, which enjoyed a rapidly increasing roll, the principal believed educational decisions should be left to the professionals. The case studies investigated this apparent contradiction, that the partnership relationship between parents and professionals which was designed to increase school responsiveness appeared to be unrelated to roll trends, a possible indicator of responsiveness. In the fourth phase I describe and evaluate how the school with the declining roll attempted to become more responsive to its community. The research results show that the concept of responsiveness contained in the initial policy documents was simplistic in that neither a community-school partnership nor school choice was sufficient to improve responsiveness to the community. I propose a more focused concept of responsiveness than that contained in the policy documents and identify two critical attributes of this concept; the school's educational values and parents' concerns about school practice. Parents choose schools because they perceive that the professionals share their educational values. I suggest that establishing cohesive values, both between home and school and within the school itself, is educationally desirable and critical to achieving responsiveness. This cohesion, however, should be enacted in a way which respects the diversity within the school population if some students are not to be alienated by the values of the majority. The second attribute of responsiveness, acting on valid concerns of parents, involves parents in decisions about school practice of greatest importance to them. Vague calls for consultation on school policy do not achieve this aim. My proposed concept of responsiveness does not assume that parents dominate areas previously reserved for professional prerogative, but rather that parents and professionals jointly determine policy in those areas critical to achieving responsiveness. School-community partnerships and school choice will not result in responsiveness unless they serve as catalysts for professional learning about the values and concerns of the community. This learning is enhanced if schools encourage parents to exercise influence and engage in joint problem-solving. Achieving school responsiveness depends more on the attitudes and skills of the participants in the partnership than on the structural changes enacted in the recent legislation.</field><field name="date">1994</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education::330100 Education Studies::330104 Educational policy, administration and management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2029</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Satellite Observations of Irregularities in the Antarctic Ionosphere</field><field name="creator">Stuart, George F. , 1940</field><field name="description">Chapter 1 Introduction. The magnetic field lines that emerge from the polar regions extend to great distances from the earth. The auroral zone closely approximate the boundary between those field lines that are closed within the magnetosphere and those that form the geomagnetic tail. the field lines int he tail may be open or possibly joined with the interplanetary field. this introduces considerable coupling between the polar ionosphere and the distant regions of the earth's atmosphere. High energy charged particles from the sun and disturbances in the magnetosphere, therefore cause large changes in the polar ionosphere, with auroral displays and regions of increased or irregular ionisation. Increasing attention is therefore, being paid to studies of the polar ionosphere to gain some insight into the changes occurring at great heights.</field><field name="date">1968</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::291700 Communications Technologies::291710 Radio communications and broadcasting not elsewhere classified</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2030</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Latest Cretaceous to late Paleocene Radiolaria from Marlborough (New Zealand) and DSDP site 208</field><field name="creator">Hollis, C. J.</field><field name="description">This is the first study of cretaceous or Paleogene Radiolaria from on-land New Zealand. It is based on five Late Cretaceous to Paleocene sections within the Amuri Limestone Group of eastern Marlborough (NE South Island): Woodside Creek, Wharanui Point, Chancet Rocks, Flaxbourne River and Mead Stream. Faunas from coeval sediments at DSDP Site 208 (Lord Howe Rise, north Tasman Sea) are also reexamined. Because diverse and well-preserved radiolarian faunas are common, the location of the Cretaceous/Tertiary (K/T) boundary well-documented, and the earliest Paleocene relatively complete, these sections provide the most complete known record of radiolarian evolution from latest Cretaceous to mid Late Paleocene (c.70-60 Ma). Systematic treatment of K-T transitional faunas was hampered by a dichotomy between Cenozoic and Mesozoic methodologies and nomenclature. To resolve this schism, broad taxonomic definitions are adopted, numerous synonymies are identified, and several revised definitions are proposed for established taxa. Of the 94 taxa recorded, 65 are species or species groups, and 29 are undifferentiated genera or higher level categories. Three new species are described: Amphisphaera aotea n.sp., A. kina n.sp. and Stichomitra wero n.sp. A new latest Cretaceous to mid Late Paleocene zonation is proposed. Six new interval zones are defined by the first appearances of the nominated species. In ascending order these are: Lithomelissa? hoplites (RK9, Cretaceous), Amphisphaera aotea (RP1, Paleocene), A. kina (RP2), Stichomitra granulata (RP3), Buryella foremanae (RP4) and B. tetradica (RP5) Interval Zones. The Late Paleocene Bekoma campechensis Zone of Nishimura (1987) succeeds RP5 at Mead Stream. The K/T boundary does not mark an extinction event for radiolarians, but does coincide with a sudden change from nassellarian to spumellarian dominance. It also coincides with a sudden influx of diatoms in Marlborough, where a fall in sea level appears to have promoted upwelling. Thus, rather than marking a catastrophe, the K/T boundary heralded a period (from RP1 to lower RP3) of great productivity for siliceous plankton. With a return to conditions similar to those of the Cretaceous, later in the Paleocene (upper RP3-RP6), Cretaceous survivors were rapidly replaced by new Tertiary taxa in deep-water settings. However, in shallower settings, many Cretaceous taxa remained abundant throughout the Early Paleocene. Faunal changes at site 208 are similar to those of the deep-water Marlborough sections, but without clear evidence for increased fertilty in the earliest Paleocene.</field><field name="date">1991</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::260000 Earth Sciences::260100 Geology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2031</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Novel synthetic anthracyclinones</field><field name="creator">Holroyd, Stephen Eyre</field><field name="description">Lewis acid mediated cyclisations of the ortho allyl substituted homochiral hydroxyanthraquinone acetals (37), (38), (43), and (44), prepared via optimised reductive Claisen rearrangements have been investigated. The mono and dichloro tetracyclic species (71-74), (76), (77), (83), (84), (87-90) and novel dioxepins (97), (98), (101), (102) have been synthesised and their stereochemistries assigned using NMR techniques. Mechanisms have been proposed for the formation of most of the products. An SN2-like process in which the dioxolane ring structure is maintained in an ion pair intermediate is favoured when tin(IV) or titanium(IV) chloride are used at lower temperatures (-78&#176;C). Such a path explains the good C7 stereoselectivity in the generation of the anthracyclinones. Thereafter the direction of chloride addition is governed by the orientation of this ion pair which provides the chloride to C-9 on the A-ring. An alternative path predominates when boron trifluoride etherate is used and at higher temperatures. This probably involves a free oxocarbenium ion which explains the poor C7 stereoselectivity, since either face of the oxocarbenium ion is equally accessible to the incoming nucleophilic olefin. An adjacent methoxy group on the anthraquinone ring lowers the stereoselectivity at both C7 and C9. This effect is explained by invoking bidentate coordination of either tin(IV) or titanium(IV) chloride to the quinone carbonyl, the methoxy oxygen and the acetal. The resultant steric interactions raise the energy of the favoured transition state and thus the acetal reacts via a different conformation, or the SN1-like path may be favoured, both of which afford a lower stereoselectivity. When titanium(IV) chloride is used with the isobutylene substituted methoxy anthraquinonyl acetal (37) a reversal in C7 stereoselectivity is found which has been explained as due to a favouring of reaction in which the other acetal oxygen has become complexed. With these substrates trimethylsilyl triflate does not induce the desired acetal/alkene cyclisation, rather the isobutylene substituted acetals (37) and (38) giving the dimethyl furans (68) and (69), while the vinyl chlorides (43) and (44) were largely unreactive. Preliminary studies on modifications aimed at introducing oxygen bearing functionality at C9 in the mono and dichloro tetracyclic species have been carried out. The potential of the acetal from condensation of the conduritol dimethyl ether (140) and the aldehyde (35) in syntheses of novel anthracyclines bearing a 7-cyclitol substituent has been studied. The cyclohexenyl acetals (143), (153), (154), and (157) have been prepared but their reactions with a variety of Lewis acids give the appropriate napthacenediones (67), (91), (133), and (155) as the only tetracyclic products isolated. It is proposed that coordination of the &#945;-methoxy groups to the Lewis acid diverts the reaction paths. A one-pot reductive Claisen/Ene reaction of the aldehyde (35) has been optimised as a method for preparing the tetracyclic anthracyclinone (163). Further modifications of this tetracycle have been investigated. Preliminary studies of a route aimed at utilising a Dieckmann condensation to furnish anthracyclinone precursors were side-tracked when rather than the desired furans an iodoetherification reaction gave a series of novel iodomethylfurans and furanocyclopropanes. The use of palladium(II) bisacetonitrile to simultaneously cleave the allyl ether and conjugate the C-allyl double bond of (33) to afford (217) has been investigated.</field><field name="date">1991</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences::250100 Physical Chemistry (Incl.

Those who refused or dropped out of treatment were followed up in a semi-control group. A broad range of patient measures were taken at intake and 6 and 18 months afterwards, when 86% of subjects were located. No treatment was more effective than another (in terms of statistically significant differences) in helping subjects to abstain or drink less, nor did any treatment appear to be more effective than another in promoting social and psychological recovery. Furthermore, those who stayed in treatment did not show significantly more long-term improvement than those who refused or dropped out of treatment. Two programmes did significantly reduce the alcohol consumption of the alcoholics assigned to them at the 6-month follow-up compared to those who dropped out, but by 18 months there was no longer a significant treatment effect. Although the two follow-ups showed individual drinking patterns were unstable, on average almost half the subjects located had improved either because they had abstained or were drinking moderately. There were only small gains on direct measures of social adjustment. Compared to the general New Zealand population, subjects were more likely to be divorced or separated, manual workers and unemployed. Nonetheless, these characteristics did not contribute to predicting the subjects' response to treatment. Multiple regression equations explained between 33% and 57% of the variance in amount drunk after treatment. The patients' own predictions of their chances of drinking again, evidence of electrocardiographic abnormalities and the patients&#8217; net weekly incomes, were more consistent variables in explaining drinking levels and predicting abstinence in the long term than the demographic and psychological variables. Variables that were significant in explaining drinking levels were often not significant when it came to predicting abstinence and vice versa. Abstinent subjects felt more often than drinkers that they had achieved the goals that they had set themselves aria by the final follow-up there were many positive differences in lifestyle apparent. Thus, in the final outcome, although abstinence was clearly demonstrated to be a worthwhile goal, no treatment was significantly more effective than another in helping to achieve this goal. Patients who underwent treatment apparently showed greater recovery than those who dropped out of treatment but this result was also not statistically significant.</field><field name="date">1984</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2033</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Empirical Analysis of the Perceived Skills and Charateristics of Managerial Effectiveness</field><field name="creator">Page, Carole</field><field name="description">The primary purpose of this research was to establish whether different perspectives on managerial effectiveness could be integrated to derive a common core of skills and characteristics. The different perspectives include management theory, strategic management and international business perspectives, and the competency-based approach to management effectiveness in the United Kingdom, The United States, and New Zealand. The research programme used a blend of quantitative and qualitative techniques. Each phase of research is supported by a review of the international literature and empirical field work conducted in New Zealand. A research tool relatively new to management research, Concept Mapping (Trochim, 1989a, 1989b), was to allow qualitative verbal statements to be described in terms of both quantitative and spatial relationships. A singular advantage of Concept Mapping is that collection and analysis of data is conducted without imposing research constructs at any stage, and a distillation of a core set of skills and characteristics can be derived through the reiterative process of Concept Mapping. In addition to Concept Mapping sessions with practicing managers and management educators and developers, two national surveys were conducted. In essence, the research builds a framework of the factors influencing managerial effectiveness through literature reviews and empirical work to generate a predictor variable list then tests that list for predictive strength. The primary outcomes of the research were: 1) the identification of a set of skills and characteristics that discriminate classes of effectiveness and ineffectiveness; and 2) the provision of a conceptual framework for analysing the similarities and differences between models of managerial effectiveness.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350200 Business and Management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2035</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Poetry in New Zealand 1850-1930</field><field name="creator">Kingsbury, Anthony Leicester</field><field name="description">Poetry in New Zealand, nearly everyone agrees, came to birth around 1920, or 1930, or 1940; in fact, round about when those who are now the grand old men of New Zealand letters were boys.

A thorough examination of the literature on small groups, coupled with field research on the implementation of teamwork in the New Zealand operations of a large multinational provides insights about how members of a team think. It is shown that the perception of membership by team members influences their ability to make effective use of resources and make informed decisions, not only within the team, but also with regard to its impact on the organisation. Social identity theory provides a theoretical model for the psychological processes of team membership. The processes of categorisation, self-categorisation and social identification are mapped against the introduction of teamwork over a period of two years to assess whether or not they are relevant. The results from surveys of and interviews with senior staff members support the processes described by social identity theory, where groups can operate as separate cognitive and emotional units as relevant for the management of teams at work. Because of the unique psychological processes, team members at work have to be interacted with (and be given information) differently than individuals in order to behave as a high-performing team. This study develops the implications of social identity theory for the introduction and management of teams at work, leading to high performance for the organisation.

These three different perspectives are seen, first, at the level of the empirical evidence of concentration and centralisation over time, and second, at the level of theoretical explanation and lastly, at the level of the sociology of knowledge, that is, how the theories themselves locate within economic cycles. The two empirical bases of this study are the survey of the top thirty companies directors and the top thirty companies networks of.1966, 1976 and 1986. A centrality analysis used on the latter three data sources, found that at the peak of the longwave (1966) when accumulation was high within the protected New Zealand economy, there were few corporate interlocks, suggesting that centralisation (the destruction of already formed capitals) was not a problem. But by the economic downturn (1986) corporate interlocks had proliferated reflecting the insecure nature of the corporate economy in crisis. The main conclusions drawn from the survey and the centralisation data sources positively corroborate the Marxist thesis that the corporate class fraction (as agents of capitalism) are in a free market economy as much directive as reactive to the state, that banks operate at direct and indirect levels of intervention on this class fraction and that there is some evidence of corporate class cohesion.</field><field name="date">1989</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370100 Sociology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2038</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Synthetic studies with podocarpic acid</field><field name="creator">Robertson, John David</field><field name="description">A series of reactions of podocarpic acid has been investigated.

Ozonolysis of podocarpic acid gave the 8&#945;,12-lactone of 8&#946;-hydroperoxy-(13-17)-pentanorlabdan-19-oic acid (82) which was reduced to the hydroxy-lactone (83) and the keto-diacid (84). The esters (81) and (87) of compounds (83) and (84) were prepared and used as model compounds for the attempted synthesis of the fungicide LL-21271&#945;. An efficient method for generating an exocyclic methylene group at C-8 of the (13-17)-pentanorlabdane skeleton was found, and the preparation and some reactions of the epoxides of dimethyl (13-17)-pentanorlabd-8(17)-en-12,19-dioate (130) and dimethyl (13-17)-pentanorlabd-8(9)-en-12,19-dioate (133) have been investigated. Bromination of 8-oxo-(13-17)-pentanorlabdan-dioic acid esters gave unexpected 7&#945;-bromo derivatives. Methyl, hydrogen 7&#945;-bromo-8-oxo-(13-l7)-pentanorlabdan-12,l9-dioate (162) was found to undergo an unusual elimination and decarboxylation reaction to give the methylene ketone (166) which underwent dimerisation affording compound (167).

G. (Michael Geoffrey)</field><field name="description">The first aim of this thesis is an introduction to some basic aspects of multivariate control theory which are relevant to the question of how the brain controls movements. A regulator is a device which forces a system to follow a specified trajectory in the presence of perturbations which might cause it to diverge from that trajectory. Regulation involves constructing an additional control input which depends upon the difference between the actual system state and the desired state. This requires the construction of a state estimate from raw data about system input and output. For effective state estimation, the sensor input gain to the state estimator needs to be time-varying. Under certain assumptions, the appropriate input gain can be specified analytically. The feedback regulation signal can then be constructed as a function of the state estimate. For effective regulation, the gain of the feedback function has to vary during maneuvers. Under certain assumptions an appropriate feedback gain can be specified analytically. The state observer input gain equations have a simple relationship to the feedback gain equations, so that gain specification is essentially the same task in each case. Cerebellar research has been dominated for the past 25 years by the theories of James Albus and David Marr. These mathematicians proposed similar models in which certain synapses in the cerebellar cortex are continuously modified by experience in such a way that movements which are consistently repeated under a given set of circumstances come to be performed automatically by the cerebellum. Much experimental work has focussed on the role of the vestibulo-cerebellum in fine control and learning of the vestibulo-ocular reflex. The state of the art along this line is formally described by Fujita's adaptive filter model of the cerebellar cortex. In chapter 4 it is shown that a basic feature of Fujita's model is inconsistent with available evidence. The 'Tensorial theory of brain function' is discussed in chapter 5. This is a novel theory of brain function which has been used in an attempt two explain cerebellar function. The attempt is a failure, based on sophistocated misconceptions and flawed by poor reasoning and clumsy analysis. The approach serves to confuse rather than clarify the question of cerebellar function. The final chapter of the first part of the thesis presents a basis for a new approach to cerebellar function based on the engineering theory of control of multivariate dynamical systems. It is proposed that the cerebellum is involved in movement regulation by controlling the gains of brainstem motor pathways, and in mapping the animal's environment by controlling the gains of sensory inputs to the midbrain. While learning undoubtedly does occur in the cerebellar cortex, this is not specifically a 'learning device', as commonly conceived. The second part of the thesis is concerned with the development and application of a method of system identification for characterising the dynamics of the vestibulo-ocular reflex and its components in an elasmobranch. The chosen method involves pulse-rate modulated bilateral electrical stimulation of the horizontal semicircular canal ampullary nerves. This produces a synthetic vestibulo-ocular reflex in a stationary preparation. The stimulus pattern is a pseudorandom binary sequence of pulse rates, so that cross-correlation of the stimulus pattern with the response signal gives a Unit Impulse Response dynamic signature for the system. Computer software for signal generation, recording, analysis and display was written by the author. The identification system was applied first to characterise the dynamics of the eye movement response to horizontal canal ampullary nerve stimulation, and compare this to the dynamics of the eye motor plant alone. The eye motor preparation acts as a first order low-pass filter with a time constant of about 0.2 seconds (16&#176;C), while the ampullary preparation acts as a second order low-pass filter with a dominant time constant of about 0.75 seconds (16&#176;C). Central pathways of the elasmobranch vestibulo-ocular reflex extend the time constant of the motor plant by a factor of 3-4, as in other animals. Eye movements predicted by fitted linear models accurately mimic eye movements recorded during experiments, suggesting both that central pathways of the reflex operate normally during this somewhat un-naturally evoked response and that the identification procedure is effective. Furthermore, combination of the ampullary nerve to eye movement transfer function obtained in this study, with head rotation to ampullary nerve transfer functions obtained by other workers, gives a consistent picture of elasmobranch vestibulo-ocular reflex function predicting compensatory eye movements in the band 0.2 - 4.0 Hz., and perhaps higher. The identification method has also been applied to produce models of vestibulocerebellar Purkinje cell dynamics during electrically evoked vestibular eye movements. Linear identification gives a poor characterisation of Purkinje cell activity during the high frequency vestibulo-ocular reflex. This is incompatible with linear phase-compensator models of the cerebellar cortex, but consistent with the reflex gain modulation theory of cerebellar function advocated in the first part of the thesis.</field><field name="date">1985</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270500 Zoology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2041</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Proteins and transcripts involved in mini-F maintenance</field><field name="creator">Phua, Sin Hen</field><field name="description">The aim of the work described in this thesis was to understand the maintenance systems of the F plasmid of Escherichia coli. The work was centered on the biochemical studies of the primary replicative fragment of F, f5. 1. From an analysis of the protein species produced by miniF-vector hybrid plasmids in E. coli minicells, seven proteins were found to be encoded by f5. Similarly, the secondary F replicon, f7, was found to code for at least three proteins. 2. The f5-specific proteins were further characterized by determining their isoelectric points and molecular weights in two-dimensional gels. 3. Using transposon-induced and deletion mutants of miniF, the structural genes of the seven f5 proteins were mapped. 4. Analysis of the amounts of proteins made by transposon-insertion mutants revealed that some miniF proteins control the expression of miniF genes. These results suggested possible mechanisms of coordination between the three f5 maintenance systems (ccd, rep and par). 5. The polarities of the f5 transcripts synthesized in minicells were determined by hybridization with f5 DNA cloned in to single-stranded phage M13 vectors. The results were consistent with the gene mapping data, in that the directions of transcription of the seven f5 structural genes are uniformly rightwards. 6. In addition, the RNA-DNA hybridization experiments revealed the existence of untranslated leftward transcripts produced from the regions involved in f5 replication and partition.</field><field name="date">1984</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270100 Biochemistry and Cell Biology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2042</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Children's understanding of sexual orientation</field><field name="creator">Saphira, Miriam Edna</field><field name="description">In 1989 New Zealand is considering legislation which will make discrimination against lesbians, transexuals and gay men illegal. To increase children's understanding of sexual orientations educators need to have some knowledge of what children already understand and how children use their information. The three studies address this issue in spite of the difficulties in obtaining permission to ask children about homosexuality. A homophobia questionnaire was administered to 290 first year psychology students. They were also asked to recall their childhood feelings about gay people when they first met a homosexual and first understood the concept of homosexuality. Older women were the least homophobic. A second study was carried out with 5, 7, and 11 year old children in three schools with a family discrimination task. A third of the 11 year olds could label the couples of the same sex as gay, homosexual or lesbian and gave more positive items to the two-parent families. A third study involved 31 children from two-parent families and 32 from lesbian families. Out of the 63 six to ten year olds, 27 could define 'homosexual' and 'gay' and 37 could define lesbian. Twenty could use a strategy to recognise a lesbian. Although social discrimination against non-heterosexual orientations placed some constraints on this research, it yielded preliminary evidence for the emergence of children's understanding of sexual orientations between 7 and 11 years of age.</field><field name="date">1990</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2043</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Molecular and genetic analysis of RepA from the P307 RepFIB replicon</field><field name="creator">Spiers, Andrew J. (Andrew Julian)</field><field name="description">The work in this Thesis concerns the replication control system of the P307 plasmid RepFIB replicon. The basic replicon occupies &#8776; 1.6kb of DNA and contains a single large open reading frame (repA) flanked on either side by a series DNA repeat elements. The organisational structure of fie replicon has placed RepFIB into the Step function class of replicons. The placement of RepFIB within this group, as well as a strong homology between RepFIB and mini-P1, has resulted in a series of predictions concerning the control elements of RepFIB replication. The aim of this work was to test some of these predictions and to characterise the fundamental control elements utilised by the replicon. This Thesis describes three different active promoter elements found embedded within the repeat elements flanking repA. Although the functional significance of two of the promoter is unknown (orip and EFp), the third is responsible for the expression of RepA and has been designated 'repAp'. All three promoters are sensitive to RepA in trans, demonstrating that repA is autoregulated and that RepA is a DNA-binding protein capable of recognising copies of the repeat elements. RepA DNA-binding has also been demonstrated in vitro using a modification of the Western analysis technique (referred to a 'Western-DNA') in order to complement the in vivo experimental results. Although the coding region of repA had been determined in earlier work, the identification of the translational start codon was uncertain. This uncertainty has been resolved by limited N-terminal sequence analysis of a RepA:&#946;-galactosidase fusion protein which has demonstrated that translation begins from a CTG codon located upstream of the predicted start sites. Finally, a series of genetic experiments have been used to determine the functional significance of RepA binding to the repeat elements. The repeat group upstream of repA are involved in autoregulation and also form part of the origin of replication, whilst the downstream repeats appear to be involved in the sensing and setting of plasmid copy number. Although the work presented in this Thesis does not directly test the applicability for RepFIB of various control models proposed to explain the behaviour of Step function replicons, the nature and type of control elements identified in RepFIB support the placement of RepFIB within the Step function class. As a result of this work, it is clear that RepFIB is confronted by the same kind of control paradox faced by replicons such as mini-P1 and mini-F. All three replicons use autoregulation and titration to control the supply of initiator protein required for replication. However, concurrent autoregulation and titration appear to be incompatible in current control models, and the identification of both mechanisms in these replicons has lead to a control paradox. Some of the results presented here suggest potentially valuable avenues of future research which may help resolve the paradox faced by RepFIB and other Step function replicons.</field><field name="date">1992</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270100 Biochemistry and Cell Biology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2044</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Christina Stead: the American years</field><field name="creator">Segerberg, Anita Kristina</field><field name="description">CHRISTINA STEAD (1902-1983) is a major Australian woman writer, and this thesis explores one of the least known periods in her life and work, the years she spent in the United States (1937- 7946). During this time she wrote her two best known novels, The Man Who Loved Children and For Love Alone, both based on autobiographical material. This study explores contextual aspects of Stead's life and work in New York, drawing on a considerable amount of new material. (Chapters I and II) During this period Stead wrote partly out of a personal need to understand her own life situation, and psychological readings of three novels, The Man who Loved Children, For Love Alone and Letty Fox, seen as a 'father trilogy', are designed to open up new lines of enquiry into aspects of all of these novels. (Chapters III and IV) The thesis also discusses formal aspects of Stead's work, beginning with her own formulation of an esthetics of the novel, which occurred during a course she gave in New York in 1943 called Workshop in the Novel. (Chapter V) The relevance of this course for her own practice as a novelist is also explored, with particular reference to the two later American novels A Little TeA, A Little Chat and, The People with The Dogs. (Chapter VI) In Chapter VII an exploration of Stead's interest in the genre of the novella, focussing on the collection The Puzzleheaded Girl, continues the formal lines of enquiry opened up in the previous two chapters, and in the following chapter the same collection provides a starting point for a consideration of Stead's deep interest in the situation of women in modern society, especially the recurrent figure of the wanderer or female rebel. The last chapter concentrates on the literary self-portraits which appeared in Stead's American fiction after The Man who Loved Children and For Love Alone, and their curiously limited characterization is compared with the more vigorous portrait of her provided in one of the novels of her husband, William Blake. This thesis, then, argues that Stead's life fed her fiction, especially in her American period, and that her work was part of a broader personal quest. Understanding this quest is relevant to a discussion of her literary style, and to her personal use of autobiographical material in her fiction, and it illuminates aspects of the creative process itself. Stead's need to understand her own life not only shaped her fiction, it also provided it with the 'intelligent ferocity' she aimed for, and resulted in a major 'realist' writer.</field><field name="date">1990</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420100 Language Studies::420101 English</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2046</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Wit at several weapons: a critical edition</field><field name="creator">Sharp, Iain</field><field name="description">The text which follows is a critical modern spelling edition of &#8216;Wit at Several Weapons&#8217; devised according to the principles established for the editors of the Revels series of English Renaissance plays.

Social referencing research has also been conducted exclusively in the university laboratory. Three studies examined the influence of self-produced locomotion on the development of social referencing and compared social referencing behaviour in familiar and unfamiliar settings. Social referencing was defined as occurring when, following a novel event, infants looked to a familiar adult and used the information provided by the adult to adjust their behaviour towards the event appropriately. In the first study, forty infants, half locomoting and half non-locomoting, were seen in their own homes at either 7-months (10 crawling, l0 not crawling) or 9-months (10 crawling, l0 not crawling). Testing was repeated on all infants 2 months later. Infants were videotaped in each of three maternal availability conditions (mother available; not available; or not interactive) before a remote control toy car moved toward them. Mothers were instructed to give either a positive or negative facial signal when their infant looked at them during this final phase. The infants were responsive to the availability of the mother on a number of dependent measures. Locomoting infants approached their mothers more, played with the toys less, and differed in some aspects of looking behaviour during the availability phases. During the final social referencing phase neither group consistently used the information provided by the mother to change their behaviour. A second study examined a further ten, 9-month-old infants using an identical procedure. The infants were delayed in the onset of self-produced locomotion due to surgical and immobilization procedures prescribed for club foot. This group did not differ from the normal non-crawling 9-month-olds in the availability phases of the study but did look to their mothers more quickly and vocalized less during the social referencing phase. The third study used a similar procedure and identical novel stimulus to examine 20, 11-month-old infants' social referencing behaviour in a laboratory situation. There was a significant difference between the infants who received a positive versus negative message for the contact with the car measures. When they received a negative message, infants tested in the laboratory were less likely to touch the stimulus car and touched it for a shorter time than infants of the same age and tested at home. Mothers of all infants participating in this study completed the Infant Characteristics Questionnaire. None of the infant characteristics predicted which infants would use the social referencing strategy. It is concluded that social referencing is not a strategy used extensively by 7-and 9-month old infants although social looking is common at these ages in response to new events. Locomotion experience has little effect on social referencing. Infants use information from a variety of sources to assess a new situation and 11-month-old infants are more likely to use social referencing as a strategy in an unfamiliar setting. Theoretical implications of the results are discussed in relation to the cognitive requirements of preverbal and emotional communication and the relative importance of social influences for interpreting novel events.</field><field name="date">1989</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2050</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Bayesian inference on astrophysical binary inspirals based on gravitational-wave measurements</field><field name="creator">R&#246;ver, Christian</field><field name="description">Gravitational waves are predicted by general relativity theory. Their existence could be confirmed by astronomical observations, but until today they have not yet been measured directly. A measurement would not only confirm general relativity, but also allow for interesting astronomical observations. Great effort is currently being expended to facilitate gravitational radiation measurement, most notably through earth-bound interferometers (such as LIGO and Virgo), and the planned space-based LISA interferometer. Earth-bound interferometers have recently taken up operation, so that a detection might be made at any time, while the space-borne LISA interferometer is scheduled to be launched within the next decade.Among the most promising signals for a detection are the waves emitted by the inspiral of a binary system of stars or black holes. The observable gravitational-wave signature of such an event is determined by properties of the inspiralling system, which may in turn be inferred from theobserved data.  A Bayesian inference framework for the estimation of parameters of binary inspiral events as measured by ground- and space-based interferometers is described here. Furthermore, appropriate computational methods are developed that are necessary for its application in practice. Starting with a simplified model considering only 5 parameters and data from a single earth-bound interferometer, the model is subsequently refined by extending it to 9 parameters, measurements from several interferometers, and more accurate signal waveform approximations. A realistic joint prior density for the 9 parameters is set up. For the LISA application the model is generalised so that the noise spectrum is treated as unknown as well and can be inferred along with the signal parameters. Inference through the posterior distribution is facilitated by the implementation of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. The posterior distribution exhibits many local modes, and there is only a small "attraction region" around the global mode(s), making it hard, if not impossible, for basic MCMC algorithms to find the relevant region in parameter space. This problem is solved by introducing a parallel tempering algorithm. Closer investigation of its internal functionality yields some insight into a proper setup of this algorithm, which in turn also enables the efficient implementation for the LISA problem with its vastly enlarged parameter space. Parallel programming was used to implement this computationally expensive MCMC algorithm, so that the code can be run efficiently on a computer cluster. In this thesis, a Bayesian approach to gravitational wave astronomy is shown to be feasible and promising.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bayesian chirp analysis</field><field name="subject">Bayesian spectrum analysis</field><field name="subject">MCMC implementation</field><field name="subject">Parallel tempering</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::230000 Mathematical Sciences::230200 Statistics</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::240000 Physical Sciences::240100 Astronomical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2356</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A contribution to the biology of the genus Carpophyllum Grev.</field><field name="creator">Dromgoole, Frank Ian</field><field name="description">The characterisation of the universal features of intertidal zonation on rocky coasts (Stephenson and Stephenson 1949; 1952; 1954; 1961) has stimulated many attempts t o explain the factors responsible for the observed patterns of distribution. Initial investigations which were essentially confined to the effects of a single factor upon different species suggested that ecological position was often correlated with physiological response. Recent studies have indicated that the subtidal distributions of algae show characteristic patterns (Kitching 1941 ; Bergquist 1960; Kain 1960; 1971; Morgans 1961 ; McLean 1962; Schwenke 1966; Neushul 1967; Clark and Neushul 1967; Larkum et al.1967; John 1971). However, there have been relatively few attempts to examine in detail and subsequently integrate the physiological response to environmental factors of major belt-demarcating algae of the sublittoral . The four New Zealand species of Carpophyllum are inhabitants of the uppermost sublittoral and the sublittoral fringe (Bergquist 1960; Dromgoole 1965). This particular study was undertaken in an attempt to elucidate the subtle differences in response which determine the distribution limits characteristic of each species. There is little information on the biology of Carpophyllum with the exception of some anatomical and embryological work (Delf 1939; Dawson 1940; Naylor 1954) and an earlier investigation of C. maschalocarpum (Dromgoole 1965). Thus to provide a basis for physiological experiments preliminary studies were directed to the following aspects: ( i ) a brief review of the morphology, anatomy and taxonomy of the genus, ( ii ) growth of sporelings in laboratory culture using various seawater media, ( iii ) definition of the geographical and vertical limits of the four species and a general study of their ecology with emphasis on population distributions, periodicitiy of reproduction and plant composition in relation to environment. The physiological response of algae to environmental factors has been examined by previous workers at the protoplasmic level using the criterion of resistance (e.g. Biebl 1956, 1962; Kanwisher 1957); at the metabolic level by measurement of photosynthesis and respiration (e.g. Chapman 1961n) ; and at the level of the whole plant by growth rates in laboratory cultures (e.g. Kain 1965) or of selected individuals in the field (e.g. Klugh and Martin, 1927). Attempts to culture Carpophyllum were not entirely successful. An earlier investigation indicated that the growth rates of Carpophyllum in situ are difficult to assess (Dromgoole 1965) and hence the metabolic approach, which does allow some integration of response to several factors by means of carbon balance calculations (e.g. Brown and Johnson 1964), has been used extensively in this study. The metabolic activity of large brown algae varies considerably with age and part of plant (Clendenning and Sargent 1957a, b; Chapman 1961a). To eliminate sampling problems in Carpophyllum a cuvette allowing continuous long-term monitoring of oxygen exchange of a single piece of material was developed. This laboratory apparatus has shown that the photosynthesis and respiration of the various organs is sensitive to environmental changes in pH, C02 supply, oxygen tension, light , water flow, dehydration and temperature. The nature and possible causes of the response t o each factor were examined in detail as this was considered essential to any interpretation of their ecological significance. Finally, the information obtained from these gas exchange measurements has been integrated by means of metabolic balance calculations and a descriptive synthesis of field and laboratory results has provided a general picture of the biology of these plants.</field><field name="date">1973</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270700 Ecology and Evolution::270702 Marine and estuarine ecology (incl. marine ichthyology)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2051</field></doc><doc><field name="title">W.

The original suggestion of the choice of these three poets came from Mr R.M. Chapman (then Senior Lecuturer in the Department of History at the University of Auckland) in early 1961; the outlines of the research project were planned by me a little later, advised by Professor S. Musgrove and Drs Allen Curnow and C.K. Stead (all of the University of Auckland&#8217;s English Department) and undertaken at that University and later at the Massey University of Manawatu, as a research project for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy, under the supervision of Dr. Curnow. The choice of the three poets concerned as objects of study was influenced not only by personal interest in their work, but also by a belief (which I feel the thesis may vindicate) that this was an opportune time to begin research into the careers of three men who, with other poets such as Ursula Bethell, Denis Glover, Charles Brasch, and Allen Curnow, may by common consensus be seen to have had a place in the first years of a significant verse tradition in New Zealand &#8211; the years from the early 1920s onwards.</field><field name="date">1966</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420100 Language Studies::420101 English</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2052</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Electrochemical studies of copper and thallium</field><field name="creator">Bailey, Peter Charles Ash</field><field name="description">The anodic growth of a Cu2O film on polycrystalline copper surfaces was studied by a potentiostatic method. Plots of anodic current versus time allowed the growth law to be determined and the Cu2O film thickness was found to vary linearly with the cube root of time. The same growth law applied when Cu2O films were formed by aqueous oxygen attack at the copper surfaces. A mechanism has been proposed explaining this law, based on assumptions of Cabrera and Mott for gaseous oxidation of copper. The cyclic voltammetry technique was used to study the growth, dissolution and reduction of Cu2O and the higher copper oxides over the pH range 5.20 to 13.83. Cu2O was the first oxide formed, and depending on the pH, either CuO or Cu(OH)2 was formed over the underlying Cu2O at higher potentials. In NaOH solutions, of concentration 0.10M and greater, presence of the oxide, Cu2O3 was noted at potentials corresponding to oxygen evolution. During cathodic reduction of the films formed anodically, the Cu(II) product was initially reduced to Cu2O, followed by Cu2O reduction to Cu metal. Solid state reactions for the growth, dissolution and reduction processes are included. No explanation for peak formation during anodic film growth by the cyclic voltammetry technique can be found but plateau formation is predicted. The inclusion of chloride in the anodically formed films increased the conductivity of the oxide films greatly. A 0.100M Na2B407 solution containing 9.6 x 10-4M benzotriazole was found to inhibit the formation of films at the copper surface probably by the formation of a Cu(BTA) polymer. The presence of sodium hexametaphosphate had no effect on oxide growth kinetics at pH 9.18. Potentials of specimens of copper piping corroding in Auckland's supply water were measured against a saturated calomel electrode. The values depended largely on the conditions of water flow and stagnation. Illumination and surface preparation of the samples had little effect. The corrosion potentials reached a maximum after approximately 30 days and the high potentials observed were attributed to the resistance of the films of corrosion products covering the metal surface. A mechanism for the corrosion process has been proposed with the electrophoretic deposition of a layer of silica gel over the underlying Cu2O film causing local cell action and the formation of anodic and cathodic areas over the copper surface. The gel allows diffusion of Cu2+ into the solution from the anodic regions and OH-from the cathodic regions, forming a loosely adherent flocc of Cu(OH)2 the metal surface. This flocc is readily scoured from the surface leading to Auckland's green water problem.</field><field name="date">1972</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2053</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A fast mobility spectrometer for atmospheric ions</field><field name="creator">Brownlee, John Nevil</field><field name="description">The development of a mobility spectrometer which yields a complete spectrum every 25 seconds is described.

S. Byatt&#8217;s Fiction</field><field name="creator">Kelly, Frances (Frances Jennifer)</field><field name="description">This thesis explores the conceptualisation of subjectivity, the past and language in the work of one particular English novelist and critic, A. S. Byatt. In doing so, it examines significant points of overlap between Byatt's fiction and criticism, on the one hand, and, on the other, the discourses that have contributed to their formation. Whilst Byatt's work is inflected by recent critical examinations of the three concepts, this thesis is less concerned with how it reflects prevailing notions of subjectivity, the past and language, than with its participation in an ongoing examination of each. Although I do investigate the interplay between Byatt's fiction and criticism, my focus is on how this is played out in Byatt's fictional texts, in particular the novels. The Introduction offers a brief summary of other criticism on Byatt's work summarises the recent definitions of 'text' and broader discussions of postmodernism that have impacted on my approach to her fiction, and proposes a reading of these texts that accounts for their ambivalence. In Chapter One, I focus on the reconfiguration of subjectivity in Byatt's writing, particularly as it relates to textuality. Chapter Two explores the relationship between present and past in Byatt's fiction that is partly enacted through the texts' own engagement with past literatures, in particular nineteenth-century literature, and the related issues of historiography, linearity and memory that these texts investigate. Language, in particular Byatt's interest in its relation to 'things', is the focus of the third and final chapter of this thesis. Throughout each of the chapters is an exploration of Byatt's engagement or reexamination of a persistent 'thread of two' in Western discourse. Although each chapter focuses on one of the three concepts, each also explores the issues that arise from the conjunction of 'two things' in these fictions: text and subject, present and past, language and the world. Related to this is my consideration of how Byatt's fiction is characterised by a number of contradictory impetuses. Of particular interest is the ambivalence that arises from Byatt's partial engagement with recent critical theory - not only because it reflects larger cultural and discursive movements, but also because it contributes to a productive forging of new forms of fiction that combine an awareness of the concerns of literary and cultural criticism with a desire to evoke pleasure in the texts.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420100 Language Studies::420101 English</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2059</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Factors influencing antibody production in vitro</field><field name="creator">Finlay, Graeme John</field><field name="description">A. ANTIBODY RESPONSES OF HUMAN TONSILLAR LYMPHOCYTES. 1 Human tonsillar lymphocytes were stimulated with pokeweed mitogen in vitro. A large number of cells developed which secreted antibody specific for sheep erythrocytes. The largest number of antibody-forming cells was produced on days 4 or 5, when optimal cell concentrations were used. Responses specific for bovine and horse erythrocytes were much smaller than those specific for sheep erythrocytes. 2 Antibody responses were studied using a culture system which permits the segregation of individual clones of antibody-forming cells. As the number of cells in each culture was increased, the efficiency with which clones were produced and the mean clone size also increased. Cell dose-response data suggest that precursors of clones detected on day 4 are less dependent on cell co-operation than those giving rise to clones detected on day 5. The frequency of antibody-forming cell precursors at the peak of the response was estimated at 1.2 to 3.8 x 10-5. 3 The physical properties of antibody-forming cell precursors were investigated. When fractionated by sedimentation velocity, precursors appeared to be enriched in fractions of cells with a larger volume than the majority of lymphocytes. Precursors were heterogeneous when fractionated on the basis of their buoyant density. Little precursor activity was detected in cells with a density of greater than 1.075 g/ml. Cells able to generate antibody-forming cells were most enriched in fractions with a density of about 1.065g/ml. Cells which suppress responses are also found in fractions of this density. 4 Hydrocortisone succinate at 1&#956;g/ml (2&#956;M)enhanced the production of antibody-forming cells in many experiments. Hydrocortisone had to be present from the time that cultures were initiated in order to exert this effect. The effect of hydrocortisone upon cells which had been fractionated on the basis of their buoyant density was examined. It was able to potentiate the responses of two medium density fractions only, and actually suppressed the responses of high density cells. 5 Hydrocortisone enhanced an antibody response stimulated by sheep erythrocytes in a similar way as it enhanced PWM-stimulated responses. The addition of sheep erythrocytes to PWM-stimulated cultures enhanced PFC responses only in the presence of the hormone. These data are interpreted as showing that suppressor cell activity is selectively inhibited by hydrocortisone. B. THE EFFECT OF IN VIVO PLASMACYTOMA GROWTH ON ANTIBODY RESPONSES OF MURINE SPLEEN CELLS IN VITRO. Spleen cells from normal and plasmacytoma-bearing mice were cultured and their antibody responses compared. In those instances where the production of antibody-forming cells was dependent upon helper T cells, it was found that the responses of cells from tumour-bearing mice were enhanced relative to controls. Thymus-independent responses were not enhanced. Evidence is presented that the nature of the effect of tumour growth upon antibody responsiveness is related to the culture system used.</field><field name="date">1979</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270100 Biochemistry and Cell Biology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2060</field></doc><doc><field name="title">New methods for analysing generalised linear models with applications to epidemiology</field><field name="creator">Holden, Jennifer Kay</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::230000 Mathematical Sciences::230200 Statistics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2061</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Crystal growth in eggshells</field><field name="creator">Silyn-Roberts, Heather</field><field name="description">Preferred orientation in the eggshells of the crocodiles, turtles and birds is shown by X-ray diffractometry to develop throughout shell deposition. In all shells, the texture that develops is one in which the (001) plane of the unit cell tends to lie parallel to the shell surface. The degree of texture varies from being high in the calcite of the ratite and tinamou shells and the aragonite of the turtle shells to low in the calcite of the crocodilian and carinate shells. A model is proposed for the deposition of the entire eggshell. This model explains the observed textures and fracture morphologies of the shells. In each shell column, crystal deposition is initiated at a single location, from which growth fans out at all angles to the shell normal. In both calcitic and aragonitic shells, growth is in the [001] direction, resulting in an increase in the degree of (001) preferred orientation with distance from nucleation. Where there is unhindered crystal growth, the shells show a crystalline fracture morphology, and the degree of texture that develops is a simple function of the column radius. This type of growth makes up the whole of the turtle shell, the inner 0.3 to 0.4 of the thick ratite shells and the cone layer of the other avian shells. At the start of the central layer of the avian shell, the onset of protein deposition coincides with a hindrance to texture development, which thereafter proceeds at a lower rate. A further hindrance occurs about half-way through the shell, probably caused by a change in the physical characteristics of the protein network. The degree of texture that develops in the avian shell is a function of the column radius and the degree of physical hindrance presented by the protein network. The central layer of the avian shell has a composite fracture morphology resulting from the intermingling of the network with the inorganic phase. The organic component does not appear to control crystal growth as previously believed, but instead acts as a reinforcing fibrous network.</field><field name="date">1984</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270500 Zoology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2062</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies of some elimination and substitution reactions in a series of l-arylnaphthalene tetrachlorides</field><field name="creator">Bedford, Keith R. (Keith Richard), 1951-</field><field name="description">The heterolytic chlorination of 1-arylnaphthalene (aryl = 1(p-nitrophenyl), (p-chlorophenyl), 1-phenyl, and 1(p-methylphenyl) ) yields the appropriate 1-aryl-r-1,c-2,t-3,t-4-tetrachloro-1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalene as the major product of addition. The 1H n.m.r. spectra of these compounds show that there is no significant change in the conformation adopted in solution accompanying the change in the para-substituent. The major product of the alkaline dehydrochlorination of each of these tetrachlorides using sodium methoxide in methanol-acetone (80:20 v/v) or benzene-methanol (75:25 v/v) is the 1-aryl-2,3-dichloronaphthalene. The first stage of the reaction is rate-controlling and both stages appear to be bimolecular. The observed rate-coefficients have been dissected to derive rates for the two competing elimination processes involving either initial loss of the 4-chlorine and 3-hydrogen or of the 1-chlorine and 2-hydrogen. The value of the Hammett reaction constant for the first of these processes was found to be 0.60 in methanol-acetone and 0.85 in benzene-methanol. The corresponding values for the second process were found to be 1.48 and 1.58. Both these results indicate that the effect of substituents in stabilizing the incipient negative charge developing at the &#946; &#8211;carbon in the transition state is an important feature of the elimination processes involved. A slow, unimolecular solvolysis at the 1-chlorine has been observed with 1-Ph-NTC and 1(p-Me-Ph)NTC in methanol-acetone. It is proposed that the major product of this solvolysis results from the replacement of the 1-chlorine by a methoxy-group with retention of configuration. In contrast, the major product of solvolysis assisted by silver(I) ions is that possessing the inverted configuration. Alkaline dehydrochlorination of the methoxy-substituted compounds derived from 1(p-Me-Ph)NTC leads to fully aromatic products. This requires the elimination of the components of a molecule of methanol under comparatively mild alkaline conditions. Dehydrochlorination from the 1-arylnaphthalene tetrachlorides promoted by aluminium chloride in carbon disulphide at reflux temperature results in a mixture of the 1-aryl-2,3- and 2,4-dichloro- products. The proportion of 2,4-dichloro- product varies from 49% (1(p-NO2-Ph)NTC) to 65% (1-Ph-NTC).</field><field name="date">1976</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2063</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies of some reactions between electrophilic halogens and various conjugated systems in which intermediates or products having rearranged double-bond systems are concerned</field><field name="creator">Hannan, Brian Neil Bernard</field><field name="description">PART I A STUDY OF MECHANISTIC VARIATIONS IN THE BROMINATION AND CHLORINATION OF SOME ALKYL PHENOLS, PHENYL ETHERS AND PNENYL ESTERS. The brominations of some 2,6-dialkylphenyl acetates in nitro-methane and in acetic acid have been shown to give (a) products of substitution at both the C-3 and C-4 nuclear sites (b) products of substitution with rearrangement leading to the formation of various brominated alkylphenols and (c) uniquely in acetic acid, a product of alkyl side-chain substitution. The bromination of the corresponding benzoate derivatives realised only the products of 3- substitution. Various products of (a) substitution and (b) substitution with rearrangement were determined in the bromination of 3,4-dimethylphenyl acetate, phenyl acetate, and 2,3,5,6-tetramethylphenyl acetate. The bromination of 2,4,6-dimethylphenyl methyl ether gave only the expected product of nuclear substitution. Evidence for the likely involvement of addition-elimination sequences in the formation of products of substitution with rearrangement, has been adduced. The possible role of various other processes leading to the formation of deacylated products is discussed. The chlorination of 2,6-dimethylphenyl acetate, 2,6-dimethylphenyl benzoate and of 2,3,5,6-tetramethylphenyl acetate in both acetic acid and nitromethane gave only the expected product of nuclear substitution. The reaction of chlorine with 3,4-dimethylphenol, its acetate and methyl ether in acetic acid led to the formation of certain enone and dienone adduct derivatives which could be shown to rearrange under the conditions of the reaction to give (a) in the case of the phenol-products of substitution and (b) for the acetate and methyl ether derivatives, products of substitution with rearrangement. The structures of the intermediates were determined from their spectral properties. Various mechanisms likely to be involved in processes of chloro-deacylation and of chloro-demethylation are discussed; a consideration of certain structural features of the substrates studied led to the conclusion that chloro-deacylation and chloro-demethylation were essentially processes initiated by ortho- attack of the chlorine molecule. PART II REACTION PATHS IN THE BROMINATION OF CHOLEST-4-EN-3-ONE, CHOLEST-5-EN-3-ONE AND 3-ACETOXYCHOLESTA-3,5-DIENE The bromination of cholest-4-en-3-one can occur by a number of reaction paths. Conditions have been established under which reaction can be established as occurring in part by electrophilic attack on (a) 3-hydroxycholesta-4,6-diene (b) 3-hydroxycholesta-2,4-diene or its anion and (c) cholest-4-en-3-one; among the products can be included 2&#945;-, 4-, 6&#946;-, and 6&#945;-bromocholest-4-en-3-one; 2&#945;,6&#946;-, 2&#945;,6&#945;-, and 4,6&#946;-dibromocholest-4-en-3-one; and 2&#945;,4,6&#946;-tribromocholest-4-en-3-one. Unstable adducts involving the 4,5-double bond are implicated in a number of cases. The bromination of cholest-5-en-3-one is equally complicated, and can involve addition to the 5,6-double bond. Knowledge of the range of conditions and reagents through which 3-acetoxycholesta-3,5-diene is brominated to give 6&#946;-bromocholest-4-en-3-one has been extended. Intermediate adducts involving the 5,6-double bond have been shown to be components of the reaction mixture from the acetoxydiene and bromine in acetic acid. Acid catalysed isomerisation and rearrangements of the kinetically controlled products, and dibromination, can be controlled by selective choice of the conditions of bromination and work-up. Complications associated with the reaction paths have been partly elucidated. The rates and mechanism of reversible isomerisation of 6&#946;- to 6&#945;-bromocholest-4-en-3-one, and of 2&#945;,&#946;- to 2&#945;,6&#945;-dibromocholest-4-en-3-one, have been studied and a proposed mechanism is outlined.</field><field name="date">1973</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2064</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cooperative learning in preschool settings: enhancing the social integration of young children with disabilities</field><field name="creator">Boyd, Andrea</field><field name="description">An examination was made of the effectiveness of cooperative learning as a strategy for enhancing the social acceptance of preschool children with disabilities who had been included in a mainstream educational setting. Preschool groups accommodating children with special needs were randomly assigned to one of three experimental conditions - cooperative play and social skills training, social skills training on1y, or control (no intervention). Children in the cooperative play programme received significantly higher levels of social acceptance than did those in the social-skills or regular preschool programmes. Moreover, the cooperative play group showed significantly more positive and more frequent social interactions with nondisabled peers than did the children in the other groups. It was also found that following the intervention the children in both the cooperative and social-skills treatment groups were rated significantly higher than were those in the control group on social skills and social play posttest measures. The results thus indicate that the use of structured cooperative play yielded an incremental effect over social-skills training in furthering the social integration of preschool children with disabilities in mainstream settings. The finding that increased social acceptance occurs in situations where social-skills training is undertaken within a framework of structured cooperative play was discussed terms of its implications for the social inclusion of young children with disabilities in integrated educational settings. It was noted that if participation in mainstream preschool settings is to be of real value for young children with disabilities, programmes designed to maximize social acceptance, such as structured cooperative play and social-skills training, need to be utilized to facilitate social interaction. Indeed, in the absence of strategies to enhance social integration, the placement of young children with disabilities in mainstream educational settings may well place such children at risk with respect to their social development.</field><field name="date">1993</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education::330100 Education Studies::330101 Educational psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2065</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The interaction of copper(II) with ligands containing nitrogen and sulphur donors</field><field name="creator">Braithwaite, Andrew Castley</field><field name="description">A study of the influence of several "soft donor" ligands on the cupric ion has been completed. Nitrogen and sulphur donors were chosen since these are considered to be present in "biological copper" situations, some of the conditions of which it was hoped to duplicate. Complicated reactions were found with several different types of ligands. Those containing imine functions, when complexed to copper(II), were invariably found to cleave due to the presence of external nucleophiles and it was considered that for such donors to be important in "biological" situations they would need to be shielded by bulky ligand systems. The cleavage reactions were found to have their origin in electronic mechanisms and earlier suggestions based on steric interactions were criticised. A study of sulphur donors showed that, whereas thioethers had a poor affinity for copper(II), thiols bonded very strongly. Reduction to copper(I) invariably took place, but with ligands containing TT-delocalised aromatic thiols as well as amine donors mixed-valent complexes of copper were formed. The properties of most of these complexes were unusual and one, especially, (N-(2-thiophenol) pyridine-2-aldiminato)copper(II) chloride, showed reactions and properties that suggested it may be a suitable model for cupro-enzymes. Complexes with thiol donors were termed "anomalous" in view of their complicated physical properties, whereas compounds with other donors showed "normal" behaviour. Absorption spectral studies were undertaken in an attempt to understand the electronic states of the "soft donor" complexes; at the same time an assessment of a recent scheme for assigning stereochemistries from visible spectra as applied to "soft donor" systems was possible. An X-ray structural determination of the complex &#956;-chloro-chlorobis(3,4-bis(3-amino-1-thiapropyl)toluene)dicopper(II) diperchlorate was undertaken, partly because of its unusual synthetic and physical characteristics. Two copper centres, one five- and the other six-co-ordinate, were found to be linked by a bridging chloride ion. The geometries about each copper ion were considerably distorted from square-pyramidal and octahedral respectively; the ligand systems also showed unusual electronic effects. Comparison with other recent structural investigations suggested that five-co-ordination is favoured by the copper ion in "soft donor" environments, and this was thought to be significant in terms of oxygen-carrying ability, where an increase in co-ordination number must occur. Several attempts to oxygenate prepared complexes were made, but no conclusive results were obtained, although several somewhat unstable crystalline products were produced.</field><field name="date">1974</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2066</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fluorocarbene complexes of ruthenium and osmium</field><field name="creator">Hoskins, S. V.</field><field name="description">This thesis is concerned with the synthesis and properties of fluorocarbene complexes of ruthenium and osmium. Chapter 1 is a review of transition metal CF3-complexes and illustrates a number of unusual features of these compounds which makes them suitable for modification into CF2-complexes. To place the fluorocarbene complexes into context, Chapter 2 contains a brief review of transition metal carbene complexes with the emphasis on other halocarbene species. As described in Chapter 3, CF3-complexes of ruthenium can be prepared by the addition of Hg(CF3)2 to Ru(CO)3(PPh3)2. The x-ray crystal structure of Ru(HgCF3)(CF3)(CO)2(PPh3)2 shows longer C-F bonds in the ruthenium bound CF3-group than in the mercury bound CF3-group. Reactions of fluorocarbon complexes with Lewis acids have been explored and RuCl(CF3)(CO)2(PPh3)2 reacts with BCl3 to form the known RuCl2(CO)(CCl2)(PPh3)2. Similarly OsCl(CF2H)(CO)2(PPh3)2 reacts with one equivalent of BCl3 to form initially a cationic carbene complex in which the carbene carbon atom substitutes first into a benzene ring of one PPh3-ligand and, through further reaction with BCl3, into a ring of the second PPh3-ligand. The x-ray crystal structures of OsCl(CO)2(PPh2C6H4CHCl)PPh3 and OsCl(CO)2(PPh2C6H4CH)(PPh2C6H4) are reported. RuCl(CF3)(CO)2(PPh3)2 in many of its reactions behaves as a CF2-complex precursor and Chapter 4 describes the reaction between the related RuCl(CF3)(CH3CN)(CO)(PPh3)2 and Me3SiCl to form the first isolable CF2-complex, RuCl2(CO)(CF2)(PPh3)2. RuCl2(CO)(CF2)(PPh3)2 contains an electrophilic carbene ligand and reacts rapidly with hard, oxygen and nitrogen containing nucleophiles. A comparison of the reactivity of RuCl2(CO)(CF2)(PPh3)2 and RuCl2(CO)(CCl2)(PPh3)2 is presented and reasons for the differing reactivities proposed. Chapter 5 shows that d8 CF2-complexes can be prepared directly from reaction between the more active CF3-transfer reagent, Cd(CF3)2-glyme, and various zerovalent complexes. The x-ray crystal structures of M(CO)2(CF2)(PPh3)2 M = Ru, Os and OsCl(NO)(CF2)(PPh3)2 are described and the bonding characteristics of the CF2-ligand discussed. The carbene ligand of M(CO)2(CF2)(PPh3)2 M = Ru, Os has some nucleophilic character and reacts readily with electrophiles, for example reaction with HC1 yields MCl(CF2H)(CO)2(PPh3)2 M = Ru, Os. A comparison between RuCl2(CO)(CF2)(PPh3)2 and Ru(CO)2(CF2)(PPh3)2 reveals that the reactivity of the carbene ligand is controlled by the electron density at the metal centre, i.e. is oxidation state dependent.</field><field name="date">1983</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2067</field></doc><doc><field name="title">William Carlos Williams: A Study of his Work</field><field name="creator">Doyle, Charles</field><field name="description">This study is twofold in purpose: (1) to examine the full range of William's writing, a task which has not been undertaken by anyone since Vivienne Koch in 1950.

(4) P. pendula Col. (previously P. macilenta Auct. non. Rich. and P. macilenta var. pendula (Col.) Cheeseman) endemic. The taxonomy and nomenclature of these species is discussed in detail and the nomenclature is also discussed for P. kingiana Endl. (previously sometimes treated as P. tremula) and P. zahlbruckneriana Endl. (previously treated under &#8216;P. comans&#8217; or P.endlicheriana Agardh) both Norfolk Is. endemics, and the taxonomy of P. sp.aff.comans LHI (previously &#8216;P. comans&#8217;) endemic to Lord Howe Island is also discussed. Detailed study of the spores and paleae using conventional light microscopy and SEM was made for these species and also P. comans Forst. f. (from the New Hebrides) and P. novae-caledoniae from New Caledonia. Comparisons of the distribution, fronds, stipes, venation, rhizomes, paleae, indumentum, apices, sori, sporangia and spores have been made and where appropriate material of P. dentata ssp. flabellata, P. pacifica and P. vittata, has also been compared. Further comparisons have been made with material of &#8216;P. comans&#8217; from other Pacific Islands including Fiji (three species ), Rarotonga, Samoa, Tahiti (each one species). P. tremula, P. kingiana and P. novae-caledoniae are exceptional in the genus because they lack paraphyses in the sori. P. kingiana and P. novae-caledoniae have a copious waxy deposit around and among the sporangial stalks but P. tremula has no accessory sporangial features at all. Germination and gametophyte growth follow the normal pattern for the genus. Some gametophytes can be kept alive and growing for considerable periods (up to three years) and become elongate, ribbon-like and unisexual (female). Hybridisation was achieved between P. carsei and P. macilenta. The progeny resemble the natural hybrid swarms suspected of being the product of the same parents.</field><field name="date">1975</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270400 Botany</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2069</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Essential replication functions of the F plasmid</field><field name="creator">Watson, Lynley A.</field><field name="description">The work in this thesis concerns the analysis of essential replication genes of the F plasmid of Escherichia coli.

Initially, L-Trp, D-Trp, IPyA, TNH2 and IAA were purified from shoots, identified by full-scan mass spectrometry and their concentrations measured using gas chromatography with an electron capture detector. High specific activity [5-3H]IAOX and [5-3H]IPyA were synthesized from L-[5-3H]Trp and used as internal standards. Purification of endogenous IPyA was enabled by forming a stable pentafluorobenzyl oxime derivative in the crude plant extract. The respective endogenous concentrations of L-Trp, D-Trp, TNH2, IPyA and IAA were found to be 2,520, 103, 146.3, 5.9 and 8.5 ng g-1 f. wt. However, IAOX could not be identified as a natural constituent of tomato shoots by full-scan GC-MS. Secondly, incubation of tomato shoots for 6, 10 and 21 h in 30% 2H2O was used as a means of labelling IAA and its putative precursors in vivo. L-Trp, D-Trp, TNH2, IPyA and IAA were then extracted and purified and the 2H content measured by combined gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. These indole compounds were labelled rapidly with up to four 2H atoms. Direct comparison of the number and the amount of 2H atoms incorporated (pattern) was obtained from the mass spectral data on the common m/z 130 ion and its isotope peaks. IAA and L-Trp demonstrated an increase in 2H label with up to 17% and 21% of their molecules labelled at 10 h respectively. This was followed by a significant decrease in 2H label at 21 h to 12% for both L-Trp and IAA. This decrease in 2H label was attributed to an increase in protein catabolism, following shoot excision, resulting in the dilution of free L-Trp pool(s) with unlabelled L-Trp from which IAA is biosynthesized. This is reflected in the observed 1.6 to 1.8 fold increase of free L-Trp from 10 to 21 h. In contrast, tryptamine demonstrated a continual increase in 2H label with an average of 8, 20 and 28% of the molecules labelled at 6, 10 and 21 h respectively, suggesting that TNH2 and IAA were synthesized from separate Trp pools. In addition, the relatively slow rate at which 2H is incorporated into tryptamine would not be sufficient to account for the rate at which IAA becomes labelled. However, IPyA demonstrated a rapid increase in 2H with 22% and 37% of its molecules labelled at 6 and 10 h respectively. From the rate at which IPyA was labelled with 2H and the concentration of IPyA in tomato shoots a rate of synthesis for IPyA in tomato shoots was estimated which was sufficient to provide most of the shoot IAA requirements. Furthermore, the extent to which IAA and IPyA were labelled relative to that of total L-Trp would imply that a smaller more rapidly metabolised pool(s) of L-Trp was the precursor of these compounds. The rate and extent that D-Trp was labelled was consistently less than that of IAA precluding it as a possible precursor of IAA. These results indicate that in tomato shoots IAA is biosynthesized from a rapidly metabolized sub-pool(s) of L-trptophan predominantly via IPyA.</field><field name="date">1989</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270100 Biochemistry and Cell Biology::270101 Analytical biochemistry</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2071</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Routes to drimanes from podocarpic acid</field><field name="creator">Grimsdale, Andrew Clive</field><field name="description">The synthesis and ozonolysis of the 6- and 7-substituted 12-hydroxypodocarpatrienes (26), (86), (90), and (98), as a possible route for the synthesis of drimanes from 12-hydroxypodocarpa-8,11,13-trien-19-oic acid (podocarpic acid) (9) has been investigated.

A suitable quadrat size and shape was selected and the sampling error was assessed. The species frequencies were calculated from presence or absence recordings. Quadrat cover, depth, gradient and substrate were also determined. Three characean species, Chara fibrosa f. acanthopitys. (A. Br.) R.D.W., Nitella leptostachys var. leonhardii (R.D.W.) R.D.W. and N.pseudoflabellata var. mucosa (Nordst.) Bailey, dominated the vegetation. The next most common pattern contained the same three species plus Lagarosiphon major (Ridley) Moss. The initial stages of L.major invasion in to a characean community was recorded from 1973 up to 1976. The charophytes ranged in depth from 0 - 17.5m and were located upon a wide variety of substrates and gradients. The native vascular plants were absent from many transects. The plants had a depth range from 0 - 4.5m with most occurring above 3.5m. The Low Mixed Community was primarily located in water less than 1.25ma at the N.E. end of the lake, which resulted in this area having a high species diversity. The exotic hydrophytes were more widespread and abundant than the native vascular phanerogams. The distribution of L.major and Elodea canadensis Michx. appeared to coincide with boating access, recreational usage and fallen submerged trees. The depth range was 0 - 6.0m, although the available habitats within this range have not yet been fully exploited. Emergent species were abundant within the S.W. inlet and also in the lagoons around the lake shoreline where sheltered conditions and shallow gradients prevail. An experimental study on the effect of erosion and sedimentation by removing the shallow water plant cover, showed that the presence of plants moderated the extent of erosion and also encouraged sedimentation. Recolonisation of cleared areas was discussed. Annual frequency changes in the vascular hydrophytes were largely influenced by water level fluctuations and by the extension of exotic species. Water-level fluctuations were observed to influence (a) the bottom limit of plant growth (probably indirectly through light penetration), (b) the upper limit of plant growth by determining available growing space, and (c) the rate of spread of exotic species by erosion and redistribution of existing stands. The 1973 raw data was processed and standardised in the form of species presence or absence, absolute frequency, and relative frequency within each transect. Distance matrices were constructed using non-Euclidean distance functions. A non-linear multidimensional scaling technique was used to construct transect and species ordinations. The advantages and problems associated with this technique are discussed and compared to alternative methods. That adopted was successfully tested for its ability to reconstruct a place map of the North Island of New Zealand. The configuration error was calculated for each ordination and was found to be less than for the alternative methods tested. From the first species ordination a concept of species prosperity was developed which involved the number of transects and quadrats within which each species was recorded, and the maximum depth recording for each species. Non-linear analysis indicated that average gradient might be a significant influence. From the first transect ordination, four vegetation groups were recognised and discussed. Depth, substrate, species dominance and gradient were significant within the ordinations. Non-linear analysis confirmed many of the previous interpretations of the ordinations but gave no further information.</field><field name="date">1978</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2074</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A spore atlas of New Zealand ferns and fern allies</field><field name="creator">Large, M.

N. (Michael Norman), 1950-</field><field name="description">Damage caused by possums (Trichosurus vulpecula Kerr) in New Zealand's extensive Pinus radiata plantations has caused concern among foresters. This study set out to examine the nature of tire problem and investigate the ecology of possums in radiata plantations in relation to damage and control. The work was carried out in the Kinleith Forest near Tokoroa in the central North Island. A review of existing literature and survey results showed that damage is mainly a problem of young plantations, consisting of bark-stripping on young trees and browsing of newly-planted seedlings. A simulated browsing experiment indicated that the latter damage was unlikely to result in discernible production losses. Bark-stripping was found to occur during the winter and spring. It had a patchy distribution and was only thought likely to prove serious where stocking was already low for other reasons. Analysis of stomach contents from animals poisoned in 1971 plantings and 1960 age class stands revealed that in both habitats possums relied heavily on foods other than pine, although in the older (1960) stands radiata pollen cones were an important winter and spring food. Insect larvae (Philia nigrostigma) were also eaten at this time of year, particularly in older stands. Little bark was consumed in either habitat, but it was a more common food in the younger stands, were it was eaten during the winter and spring. It is suggested that bark-stripping in young stands may be a response to relatively poor nutrition during the winter and early spring. Data on fat reserves, reproductive performance and growth support the view that the overall plane of nutrition was better among possums in the older stands. Possum populations were studied by livetrapping and radiotelemetry in two areas, one within a 1960 age class radiata stand (FRSA), the other extending across the boundary between a 1971 planting and cutover native forest (MSA). In the latter area there was a seasonal pattern of habitat use, with animals tending to use the native forest to a greater extent than the plantation during the winter. Population densities were similar in the two areas (2-3/ ha), with the MSA population having an apparent trend of increase. The two populations differed in composition, the FRSA one having an excess of females and the MSA an initial excess of males but an increasing proportion of females. It is suggested that disturbance of the MSA population, by burning in 1971 and subsequent poisoning, resulted in partial depopulation with initial recolonisation predominantly by dispersing males. Results from both study areas showed that young males have a greater tendency to disperse from their native area than do young females. Radiotelemetry revealed that possums in the MSA used more dens than those in the FRSA and good dens appeared to be few in the latter area. It is suggested that dens may be a limiting resource for some possum populations. Since females are known to control the use of dens the survival of males should be poorer where dens are limited, resulting ultimately in a biased sex ratio. Experimental depopulation of the FRSA and monitoring of its recolonisation over one year suggested that population re-establishment on cleared areas does not depend on local reproduction by survivors, but is primarily by dispersal in the initial stages, with an early influx of young males. The MSA population was also poisoned, in a standard 1080 airdrop, and the effectiveness of this operation was monitored. Current control practices are critically appraised in the light of the results obtained in this study and the value of widespread aerial poisoning operations in pine plantation habitats is questioned.</field><field name="date">1977</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270700 Ecology and Evolution</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2075</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The alpine survey: George Meredith as social critic</field><field name="creator">Church, Antoinette</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">1974</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2077</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Investigation of Behavioural Models of Detection</field><field name="creator">Godfrey, Rebecca</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2078</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Social psychology and mental retardation: towards an applied social psychology of mental retardation</field><field name="creator">Haxell, Mark Robert</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">1991</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2079</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sources of variance in the detection of auditory signals with special reference to unstable decision criteria</field><field name="creator">Bridgman, Geoff, 1946-</field><field name="description">Data from twelve auditory signal detection experiments show that a model general to all signal detection tasks explains results better than specific auditory models. This thesis examines models of the detection of sinusoids in Gaussian white noise, all predicting linear ROC-curves on normal-normal co-ordinates, but differing in their predictions for the ROC-curve slope. Distinction is made between stimulus distributions, transducer distributions and response-inferred distributions. Response-inferred distributions include variance from stimuli, transducers and unstable criteria. The first three experiments (rating) showed that slope increases with increases in p(sn) and in the number of categories available for describing the presence of the signal. An explanation for this data assumes that the 'yes-no' criterion has the least variance and other criteria have variances proportional to their distances from the 'yes-no' criterion. This explanation is developed into a model of selective attention in which the variance of all real criteria is a function of their distances from an optimal criterion. Faulty memory is the assumed cause of criterion variance. Predictions that follow from the model are (i) there is a decline in criterion variance as signal strength increases ; (ii) there is a U- (or inverted U-) shaped function relating slope and signal strength; (iii) criterion variance is less in forced-choice tasks than in 'yes-no' tasks; and (iv) slope is partially determined by task design and any other factor which affects the subject's memory for signal or noise. Experiments 4-6 establish that the concept of criterion variance also applies to yes-no procedures, and Experiments 7-11 substantiate predictions made by the model of selective attention. Data from Experiments 5, 7, 8, 9 and 10 are analysed in terms of models of sinusoidal burst and gap detection. None of the probabilistic models is adequate, but Zwislocki's (1969) deterministic model of temporal summation accounts for the data. A model of response-inferred distributions is presented in which the mathematical relationships of the variances and locations of criteria, of signal strength and of stimulus variances to the slope of the ROC-curve are described. Equations for the optimal criterion, the variance of individual criteria and a measure of sensitivity uncontaminated by criterion variance are derived. Re-analysis of data using the model of response-inferred distributions supports the predictions of the model of selective attention. The model of response-inferred distributions predicts 'peaked' rating ROC-curves which are similar to two-state functions and commonly observed in the literature. However, both two-state and high-threshold theories are unable to explain the data. Experiment 12 compares the model of response-inferred distributions with Pike's (1973) multiple observations model for latency data and finds the latter model inferior. Criterion variance is shown to account fox at least half of the variance of the response-inferred distributions, and consequently, it is argued that TSD results should be viewed more in terms of the general processes which produce criterion variance than modality-specific models of signal processing.</field><field name="date">1977</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2080</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Trends and ethnic disparities in the incidence and outcome of stroke in Auckland, New Zealand over 20 years</field><field name="creator">Carter, Kristie Norah</field><field name="description">Aims:  The aims of this thesis were to investigate trends and ethnic disparities in the incidence and outcome of stroke in Auckland, New Zealand between 1981 and 2003. Methods:  Trends were assessed using information from the three Auckland Regional Community Stroke (ARCOS) studies, conducted in people (aged &#8805;15 years) in Auckland, during 12-month calendar periods in 1981-1982, 1991-1992, and 2001-2002.  These studies used comparable definitions and case finding methods and have been shown to meet the stringent criteria for a population-based &#8220;ideal&#8221; stroke incidence study.  Rates were calculated using Poisson distribution and are presented with 95% confidence intervals.  Trends in survival were assessed using Cox Proportional hazards regression modelling. Results:  Overall trends in the incidence and event rates of stroke declined across the study period.  These declines were significant in males and for the ages 65 to 74 years only.  However, growing disparities in the rates of stroke between the major ethnic groups in New Zealand were found, with significant declines in New Zealand Europeans and increases in M&#257;ori and Pacific populations.  Dramatic improvements in survival over the study period were also found, with the greatest improvement in the acute period, within the first 28-days after stroke.  Adjustments for patient or disease severity factors strengthened the survival model.  However, adjustments for care/service factors nullified the survival model, thus explaining most of the improving trend. Conclusions:  The small declines in the incidence of stroke, improvements in survival and the ageing of the New Zealand population will lead to data dramatic increases in the number of people living with the effects of stroke.  To maintain stable numbers of strokes occurring, more intensive prevention strategies need to target high-risk populations and population-wide health education strategies are needed to improve the health of the general population, hence reducing the risk of stroke.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Stroke</field><field name="subject">Epidemiology</field><field name="subject">Ethnic disparities</field><field name="subject">Incidence</field><field name="subject">Survival</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2365</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Proton polarization in the 3He(d,p)4He reaction</field><field name="creator">Clare, John Frederick</field><field name="description">The proton polarization in the 3He(d,p)4He reaction induced by unpolarized deuterons has been measured at deuteron lab. energies of 2.0, 2.8, 3.9 and 6.0MeV for 20 angles between 0&#176; and 150&#176; (c.m.). Statistical uncertainties are typically &#177; 0.01. The measurements were made with a proton polarimeter in which the left-right asymmetry of scattering at 60&#176; (lab.) in 4He is determined. The polarimeter employs "venetian-blind" collimation of the protons by conical vanes and 75 cm2 plastic scintillator detectors. Four detectors are included for use in polarization transfer experiments. For 10.5 MeV protons and a helium pressure of 250 p.s.i. the target thickness is 3 MeV and the efficiency per detector per unpolarized proton incident is 10-4. For each polarimeter detector a triple coincidence with a 15 ns resolving time was required with two scintillator transmission detectors preceding the polarimeter. Spectra of random coincidences were accumulated simultaneously and subtracted. Asymmetries resulting from polarimeter-target misalignment and other geometrical effects are discussed. All results quoted are geometric means of pairs of measurements for 180&#176; rotation of the polarimeter and are also arithmetic means of such measurements to left and right of the 3He target. The absolute analyzing power is estimated by computer simulation of trajectories to be -0.638 &#177; 0.020 for protons entering at 10.3 MeV. The product of polarization and cross section is fitted to an expansion of first-order associated Legendre polynomials using these results and earlier measurements. Only four terms are required except at 6.0MeV where a fifth is necessary. The energy dependence of these coefficients suggests resonances in 5Li at deuteron energies of 60MeV (odd coefficients) and 7.5 MeV (even coefficients) in agreement with results for the polarized-beam analyzing powers(1). Comparison of the results with vector-polarized-beam (1) and polarized-target(2) analyzing powers shows no evidence for the postulated simple relations(3) based on DWBA cal calculations. Comparison of the results with recent measurements of the neutron polarization in the mirror reaction(4) shows no significant differences. The theory of angular correlations in charged particle reactions is developed and used to calculate outgoing nucleon polarizations. Expressions are given for polarization transfer coefficients. These coefficients are evaluated in terms of the T-matrix elements for the interference of various channels with the dominant S-wave, J&#928; = 3+/2 channel in 3He(d,p)4He at the 0.43 MeV resonance. Two experiments to measure combinations of these elements are discussed. (1) Gruebler, W. et al., 1971, Nucl. Phys. Al76, 631 (2) Leemann, Ch., W.

The author spent fifteen months in the field, spread over three fieldtrips between 1975.and 1978. Welfare Society members in Hahalis Village shared with the author the work of their hands so that she could appreciate the significance of the ground, and the work of their hearts so that she could feel the compassion, love, and positive exuberance that informed their thinking &#8211; thus enabling her to understand in some measure the analysis, critique and transformation of Buka culture and society in which they were engaged. The first chapter of this thesis elaborates the relationship between Hahalis Welfare Society and its historical, and contemporary social/political context on Buka. There is also a discussion of the author's approach to fieldwork on Buka &#8211;both in terms of theory and practice. The second chapter explores the nature of traditional power and leadership which remain central to the philosophy and organization of the Welfare Society. The special importance of matrilineal principles and the brother-sister relationship are explored, as are forms of alliance between lineages and moieties. The qualities of balance and restraint inherent in the Buka concepts of power and leadership are shown to be under some strain in the contemporary political and economic context. Chapter Three discusses ritual occasions in relation to the issues raised in the preceding chapter. Ritual is seen as a creative re-thinking of the nature of power, and personal and social relationships &#8211; a complex weave that reflects the past, the present, and possible future designs. Chapter Four centres more directly on the role of women in Welfare Society and their past and present active participation in the development of its philosophy and its practice. The final chapter explores three issues drawn from the author's fieldwork experience which are discussed in terms of their relevance to Hahalis Welfare Society, and the development of anthropological practice. These issues centre on the subjective stance in anthropological fieldwork, the debate over fertility and family planning, and the problematic interpretation of sacrifice.</field><field name="date">1982</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370300 Anthropology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2082</field></doc><doc><field name="title">For God or Man: Notions of Women in Seventeenth Century England</field><field name="creator">McCrystal, John</field><field name="description">This study argues that 'new' ways of speaking about the nature and status of women are evident in the literary record of late seventeenth century England, particularly in the writings of Mary Astell (1666-1731). Writing to oppose the natural rights-based political theory of the 'Father of Modern Liberalism', John Locke, Astell employed the secular, rationalist, individualistic language which Locke himself used to argue the equal human dignity of women with men. Hers was the first unequivocal plea made by an English writer. The subject of this study is the provenance of these new modes of thinking about women. The result of a survey of primary sources, dating primarily from the period 1600-1700, it first seeks to show that seventeenth century England inherited a 'traditional' notion of women and their status from antiquity; scriptural, philosophical and empirical evidence of women's moral and intellectual equality with men coexisted uneasily with the consensual notion that they were men's subordinates. This notion survived the Continental and English Reformations to be incorporated into the theology of both the Church of England and the Puritans alike. Thinking and writing about women took place in the context of an 'ideology of order', wherein individuals were considered solely in relation to society and in terms of their obligations and status. It is then argued that the paradox of women's equal humanity and subordinate status first received serious interrogation during the political crises of 1640-1660. Radical Protestants, who placed the individual believer - male or female - at the centre of religious life, allowed women to participate to an unprecedented degree in worship. The potential of radical Protestantism to challenge the traditional subordination of women was obvious in the political theory of the 'Levellers', who secularised religious individualism to produce a programme of democratic reform. The invisibility of women in this proto-liberal programme is given special attention here. The paradox inherent in the traditional notion of woman was thrown into sharp relief, furthermore, in the course of the political debates between royalists and parliamentarians during the Civil War; both sides attempted to liken the relationship between king and people to that between husband and wife. The marriage analogue served to highlight the gap which was opening between political analysis and the justifications for the subordination for women. Finally, it is argued that renewed political crisis in the last two decades of the century saw the introduction of secular individualism to English political thought, reinforced with the 'new' metaphysics of Descartes. John Locke considered that since individuals constructed society for their own ends, they could resist government where these were not being served. Yet as Astell pointed out, Locke fell back upon the traditional assumption that women ought to be subordinated in this society to men. She adopted the new metaphysics to show not only that Locke's political conclusions were wrong and dangerous, but also to show that women, their subordinate social status notwithstanding, were of equal dignity and worth to men.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::360000 Policy and Political Science::360100 Political Science::360104 Political theory and political philosophy</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2083</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Structural studies of metal-ribonucleotide complexes</field><field name="creator">Orbell, John Donald</field><field name="description">The crystal and molecular structures of five binary complexes between transition-metal ions and 5'-ribonucleotides have been determined by X-ray crystallographic means.

It has been found that the yields of benzobisbenzofuranquinonoid (1) derivatives are greater when after initial nucleophilic attack on the ketoenoid system by the oxygen atom of the phenoxide ion, the carbon atom ortho to the vinyl-aryl ether linkage is activated towards further nucleophilic attack by the presence of a suitably orientated electron releasing substituent. The other products of the reaction mixture have been isolated and characterised, and the spectral data discussed for the derivatives of 2,3-diethoxydi-benzofuran-1,4-quinone which were obtained in this way. The mass spectra of benzobisbenzofuranquinones and the corresponding quinol acetates have been examined. Facile loss methyl radicals from aromatic methoxy groups and ketene from the acetate derivatives was observed. Decarbonylation and fragmentation involving the heterocyclic ring system resulted in peaks of only minor intensity. The ready loss of substituents as described above is explained by the resulting formation of resonance stabilized quinonoid ions. Some chemical constituents of Peniophora gigantea have been isolated and characterised. 2',3',6'-Trimethoxy-p-terphenyl (25) was obtained which represents the first methoxylated p-terphenyl isolated from a fungus. Also obtained was a mixture comprising two compounds, C30H48 and C30H50. On mass spectral grounds these are proposed to be the pentacyclic triterpenes, lupa-15,19(22)-diene (33) and lup-19(22)-ene (34) respectively. 14,15-Epoxy-2-ketomanoyl oxide (44) has been microbiologically hydroxylated by Calonectria decora to form 1&#946;,7&#945;-dihydroxy-14,15-epoxy-2-ketomanoyl oxide (45). The positions of the hydroxyl groups were determined from the peaks arising from fragmentations in rings A and B in the mass spectrum. Strong intramolecular hydrogen bonding observed in the i.r. spectrum supported the equatorial conformation of the hydroxy group at Cl whilst the facile loss of water upon electron impact and the presence of a signal corresponding to an equatorial carbinol proton in the n.m.r. infers that at C7 is axial. Finally, it has been proposed that the structures of the blue pigments, corticins A and B, isolated from Corticium caeruleum by Dean are 2,6,9-trihydroxy-3,8,12-trimethoxybenzo[1,2-b:4,5-b']bisbenzofuran and 2,3,8,9-tetramethoxybenzo[1,2-b:4,5-b']bisbenzofuran-6,12-dione respectively.

The second deals with the phonology of the 'Ua Pou dialect, concentrating in particular on two areas; the phonetics of the glottal stop phoneme, and penultimate vowel extension. The latter is a feature which has received no mention in any literature to date but is the most noticeable suprasegmental phonetic difference between the Marquesan dialects and the other Eastern Polynesian languages. The last four chapters describe the structure of phrases in the 'Ua Pou dialect. The first two of these deals with the centripetal particles of the noun and verb phrase respectively, that is, the particles within phrases which modify the base of that phrase. Particles which relate phrases to other phrases, that is, the prepositions and ai, are dealt with separately in the last two chapters since their description requires some comments on the syntax of the language.</field><field name="date">1990</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420100 Language Studies::420104 Pacific languages</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420300 Cultural Studies::420306 Maori cultural studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2086</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analysis of clones of cytotoxic lymphocytes</field><field name="creator">Ching, Lai-Ming</field><field name="description">1.	&#8216;Spotaneously&#8217; generated cytotoxic clones were detected when normal spleen cells from CBA, DBA/2 or (CBA x DBA/2)F1 mice were cultured in polyacrylamide cultures vessels without stimulator cells. Cytotoxicity was mediated by T cells and the highest number of clones occurred after 4 days in culture. The spontaneous cytotoxic T cell clones were detected mainly in adult spleen cell cultures. Few spontaneous clones were generated by lymph node, thymus or neonatal spleen cells. 2.	The production of spontaneous clones does not increase linearly with the number of cells cultured which is in contrast with the production of &#8216;stimulated&#8217; clones of cytotoxic lymphocytes in the polyacylamide vessels. At the optimal cell concentration, 1.3 x 10 7 cells per culture, 20 spontaneous clones of CLs lysing P815 mastocytoma cell targets were detected in cultures of (CBA x DBA/2)F1 spleen cells and 14 clones were detected in cultures of CBA or DBA/2 spleen cells. 3.	The specificity of the spontaneous clones was examined by dividing each clone into two halves and assaying the half clones against a pair of different target cells. A range of spontaneous CLs of different specifications was produced. Spontaneous clones lysing syngeneic and allogeneic tumour or normal spleen cell blasts, as well as hapten-modified target cells were detected. 4.	Individual spontaneous clones of CLs exhibited a high degree of discrimination and were able to differentiate between many pairs of target cells which were syngeneic with respect to each other. 5.	When blast cells which had been induced by various mitogens were used as the target cells, the results indicated that spontaneous CL clones could discriminate between subsets of syngeneic lymphocytes which respond to different mitogens. 6.	One-way stimulated CL responses were generated using cells from mice which had been treated with cyclophosphamide. Treatment of mice with 200mg/kg cyclophosphamide abolished the ability of the cells to generate spontaneous clones in culture without impairing their ability to stimulate the production of CLs in responder cell populations. 7.	In contrast with spontaneous clones which could discriminate between different H2d target cells, CLs produced by CBA spleen cells stimulated with H2d alloantigens were observed not to differentiate between various H2d target cells. The results indication that spontaneous clones of CLs were not a representative sample of the stimulated clones of CLs. 8.	When CBA spleen cells were stimulated simultaneously with H2b and H2d alloantigens, separate populations of Cls against the two sets of antigens were produced. Very few cross-reactive clones were detected. 9.	When (CBA x C57B1)F1 spleen cells were stimulated with syngeneic F1 cells modified with TNP, clones of CLs lysing TNP modified cells of the F1 and the two parental strains were produced. The frequency of clones produced by F1 spleen cells against F1-TNP, CBA-TNP and C57B1-TNP target cells was 1 per 3.3 x 10 4, 1 per 6.7 x 10 4 and 1 per 10 5 spleen cells respectively. When (CBA x C57B1)F1 cells were cultured with TNP-modified CBA cells, clones of CLs against TNP-modified cells of both the parental strain were produced. CLs which lyse CBA-TNP and CLs which lyse C75B1-TNP targets segregated as two distinct populations with no cross-reactivity.</field><field name="date">1978</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270100 Biochemistry and Cell Biology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2087</field></doc><doc><field name="title">General managers in the South Pacific: managerial behaviour and the impact of culture on decision making in the island nations of the South Pacific</field><field name="creator">Reddy, Narendra</field><field name="description">This research is concerned with the way in which general managers work in the island nations of the South Pacific: what they do, how they make policy decisions and manage the various resources of their organization. It looks particularly at the impact of their culture on management decision making. A literature review revealed that until recently most of the research work on managers was done in the west. In recent years there has been a proliferation of research on Japanese management practices and the decision making styles of Japanese managers. However, there is little research on managers and management in developing countries, and hardly any on managers and management, in the South Pacific island nations. This was dramatically evident when a computer search was completed early in this study. There were thousands of references available on managers and management. As more key words were included the number of references declined. Eventually when 'the South Pacific' was added there was a blank. The south Pacific is very much virgin territory when it comes to research information and data on managers and management. The question 'what do managers do?' appears simple but is difficult to answer. The traditional view of the manager's job comes from the classical school of writers who describe their work in terms of a composite of functions. Fayol defined it, in terms of five basic managerial functions planning, organizing, coordinating, commanding and controlling. In the 1930s Gulick introduced the concept of POSDCORB. Among later empirical works one of the most comprehensive studies on managers has been by Mintzberg who defines a manager's job under its distinguishing characteristics, the working roles, the variations in the manager's job, and the scientific nature of work. In this study the general manager's work has been examined by gathering data from in-depth interviews and observations of twenty general managers/chief executives from the South Pacific region. Four general managers each from Fiji, Western Samoa, Solomon Islands, Kiribati and Tonga were observed and interviewed for a week each over a seven month period and the results of the study are reported in this thesis. The study revealed that the work of general managers in the South Pacific islands is fragmented and they are engaged in a lot of activities with short duration. Furthermore routine administrative functions consume much of the chief executive's time, while little time and attention is devoted to planning and development work. The various indigenous South Pacific cultures are not supportive of managers, management and businesses in their endeavour to be successful and progressive. The cultures are conservative and generally do not want change, at least rapid change, and wish to preserve and maintain their culture and way of life.</field><field name="date">1991</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350200 Business and Management</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420300 Cultural Studies::420307 Pacific cultural studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2088</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Metal Ion Catalysis of Substitution and Rearrangement Reactions of Some Complex Oxalates of Chromium(III)</field><field name="creator">Buisson, David Huon</field><field name="description">The metal ion catalysed aquation of the trisoxalatochromium(III) ion has been studied in the presence and absence of added electrolytes with emphasis on the copper(II) ion catalysed aquation. The interpretation of the observed catalytic effects of the copper(II) ion, has been attempted in terms of ion association. The proposed scheme, for the aquation, involves metallation of the CrOX33- species to account for the promoting effect of the copper(II) ions. The specific rates of aquation and formation constants of the various species formed between the copper(II) ion and the CrOX33-  ion have been obtained using curve fitting techniques. Further, the dependence of the formation constants and the specific rates of aquation on temperature has been shown to yield realistic thermodynamic and activation parameters for the proposed model. Increasing the pH was found to have an accelerating affect on the aquation of the trisoxalatochromium(III) ion at constant copper ion concentration. This has been discussed, using ion association, in terms of catalysis of the aquation reaction by hydrolysis products of the copper(II) ion, in particular the CuOH+ ion. The catalysed and uncatalysed isomeristion of the bisoxalatochromium(III) ion has been investigated in the presence and absence of various electrolytes and the kinetic data has been rationalized in terms of an ion association model. It has also been proposed, from comparisons of studies on the copper(II) ion catalyes aquation and racemisation of the trisoxalatochromium(III) ion, that a copper(II) ion associates with the CrOX33- ion through three carboxyl oxygen atoms, one from each oxalate group to form a monometallated species. Further comparison of these studies has led us to postulate, in the aquation, that a second copper(II) ion, proposed to associate with the monometallated species, associates with two carbonyl oxygen atoms of one of the oxalate groups of the CrOX33- ion. This, and the comparison of the specific rates of aquation of the monometallated and bimetallated species, led us to the conclusion that aquation occurs by a rapid one ended dissociation of an oxalate ligand followed by a rate determining loss of the oxalate group.  A number of other results of relevance to the substitution and rearrangement reactions of chromium(III)-oxalate complexes, have also been included.</field><field name="date">1971</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2089</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mechanisms of cytokinin action</field><field name="creator">Berridge, Michael Vivian</field><field name="description">1.	Twenty-two synthetic analogues of adenine were tested for their ability to promote the growth of Chinese cabbage leaf discs. In general an adenine residue substituted in the N6 position with a group of moderate size is required for maximum growth activity. 2.	Kinetin increases the turnover of ribosomes in floated Chinese cabbage leaf tissue. 3.	The synthetic cytokinins kinetin and 6-benzylaminopurine bind reversibly to purifies Chinese cabbage leaf ribosomes. At 4&#176;C, 0.8 molecules of kinetin and 1.08 molecules of 6BA are bound per ribosome. Adenine and adenine derivatives that are inactive as cytokinins showed much lower affinity for ribosomes. A positive correlation between the extent of ribosome binding of synthetic adenine analogues and their biological cytokinin activity was demonstrated. 4.	&#8216;In vitro&#8217; aminoacylating systems from Chinese cabbage and &#8216;in vitro&#8217; protein synthesizing systems from Chinese cabbage and etiolated pea shoots were developed and characterized. Cytokinins had no significant effect on these systems. 5.	Kinetin increased gross starch degradation and sugar utilization in leaf discs floated for 3 days in the light or dark whether or not sucrose was present in the floating medium. Since kinetin induced a change in neutral sugars prior to a change in starch content of the tissue, reduced sugar pools in kinetin treated tissue are suggested as the cause of induced starch degradation. 6.	14Co2 labelling of leaf tissue pretreated with kinetin for 24hr showed increased radioactivity in chloroform-soluble material and most sugar phosphates and a 35-40% decrease in radioactivity in the neutral sugars, glucose, sucrose and fructose. Incorporation into ATP was increase by 40% by kinetin. 7.	Isolated pea nuclei bound 6BA, kinetin and vvDMAAP, but showed low affinity for 3BA. DNase treatment of the nuclei enhanced 6BA binding by 100% while pronase treatment reduced binding. Binding sites liberated by DNase treatment showed reduced affinity for 3BA. It is suggested that nuclei contain cytokinin receptor site of a protein nature.</field><field name="date">1971</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270100 Biochemistry and Cell Biology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2091</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies in New Zealand Late Paleogene&#8211;Early Neogene Radiolaria</field><field name="creator">O'Connor, Barry M.</field><field name="description">Radiolaria from Late Eocene to Early Miocene localities in New Zealand are detailed in a series of studies in an attempt to broaden our knowledge of New Zealand Late Paleogene-Early Neogene Radiolaria, and a new technique for investigating Radiolaria is described. Chapter One introduces the studies and the rationale behind each, details the history of radiolarian work in New Zealand, and provides discussion of several points that surfaced during the studies. The points discussed are: radiolarian literature; plate production; scanning electron micrographs versus transmitted light photomicrographs; skeletal terminology; systematic paleontology and the description of new species; radiolarian classification; usefulness of strewn slides. Each study constitutes a published in press, or in review paper and is presented as a chapter. As each chapter is able to stand alone, their abstracts are given below. The reference lists for each paper/chapter have been amalgamated into a master list at the end of the thesis and so do not appear at the end of each chapter: Chapter Two - Seven New Radiolarian Species from the Oligocene of New Zealand Abstract: Seven new radiolarian species from the Oligocene Mahurangi limestone of Northland, New Zealand, are formally described. They are: Dorcadospyris mahurangi (Trissocyclidae), Dictyoprora gibsoni, Siphocampe missilis, Spirocyrtis proboscis (Artostrobiidae), Anthocyrtidium odontatum, Lamprocyclas matakohe (Pterocorythidae), Phormocyrtis vasculum (Theoperidae). Chapter Three &#8211; New Radiolaria from the Oligocene and Early Miocene of Northland, New Zealand Abstract: Thirteen new radiolarian species, two new genera and one new combination from the Oligocene and early Miocene of Northland, New Zealand, are formally described - The species are &#8211; Heliodiscus tunicatus (Phacodiscidae), Rhopalastrum tritelum (spongodiscidae), Lithomelissa gelasinus, L. maureenae, Lophophaena tekopua (Plagiacanthidae), Valkyria pukapuka (Sethoconidae), Cyrtocapsa osculum, Lophocyrtis (Paralampterium)? inaequalis, Lychnocanium neptunei, Stichocorys negripontensis, Theocorys bianulus, T. perforalvus, T. puriri (Theoperidae); the genera are &#8211; Plannapus (Artostrobiidae) and Valkyria (Sethoconidae); the combination is Plannapus microcephalus (Artostrobiidae). Standardised terminology is proposed for internal skeletal elements and external appendages. Emendations are proposed for the family Artostrobiidae and the genera Heliodiscus, Lithomelissa and Cyrtocapsa. Heliodiscus, Cyrtocapsa and Lychnocanium are established as senior synonyms of Astrophacus, Cyrtocapsella and Lychnocanoma respectively. Chapter Four &#8211; Early Miocene Radiolaria from Te Kopua Point, Kaipara Harbour, New Zealand Abstract: Radiolaria from the Early Miocene Puriri Formation at Te Kopua Point in the Kaipara area, Northland, New Zealand are documented. Six new species are described - Spongotrochus antoniae (Spongodiscidae), Botryostrobus hollisi, Siphocampe grantmackiei, (Artostrobiidae), Carpocanium rubyae (Carpocaniidae), Anthocyrtidium marieae (Pterocorythidae) and Phormocyrtis alexandrae (Theoperidae). Carpocanium is established as the senior synonym of Carpocanistrum. Chapter Five &#8211; Radiolaria from the Oamaru Diatomite, South Island, New Zealand Abstract: Radiolaria from the world-famous Oamaru Diatomite are documented with 24 new species described and three new genera erected The new species are Tricorporisphaera bibula, Zealithapium oamaru (Actionommidae), Plectodiscus runanganus (Porodiscidae), Plannapus hornibrooki, P. mauricei, Spirocyrtis greeni (Artostrobiidae), Botryocella pauciperforata (Cannobotryidae), Carpocanopsis ballisticum (Carpocaniidae), Verutotholus doigi, V. edwardsi, V. mackayi (Neosciadiocapsidae), Lithomelissa lautouri, Velicucullus fragilis (Plagoniidae), Lamprocyclas particollis (Pterocorythidae), Artophormis fluminafauces, Eucyrtidium ventriosum, Eurystomoskevos cauleti, Lophocyrtis (L.) haywardi, Lychnocanium alma, L. waiareka, L. waitaki, Pterosyringium hamata, Sethochytris cavipodis and Thyrsocyrtis (T.?) pingusicoides (Theoperidae). The new genera are Tricorporisphaera, Zealithapium (Actinommidae), and Verutotholus (Neosciadiocapsidae). Emendations are proposed to the family Neosciadiocapsidae and the genus Eurystomoskevos, and Pterosyringium is raised from subgeneric to generic level. Radiolarian faunal composition confirms a Late Eocene age for the Oamaru Diatomite. Chapter Six &#8211; Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy: A New Technique for Investigating and Illustrating Fossil Radiolaria Abstract: Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), a technique newly applied to the study of fossil Radiolaria, offers the radiolarist clear views of single optical planes of specimens, unhindered by many of the optical effects of conventional light microscopy, while obviating the need to section or break specimens. Resulting images are of a clarity unsurpassed by conventional light microscopy and, as they are saved on computer, are easily viewed, manipulated, enhanced, measured and converted to hard copy. Used in conjunction with common radiolarian study methods CLSM is a powerful tool for gaining additional information with relatively little extra effort. Chapter Seven conveniently summarises taxonomic, stratigraphic and geographic data of all new taxa described, incorporating information gained from the studies and relevant literature.

It examines the complex relationships between alcohol and culture, and how such relationships interact to influence health. As well, it explores how Samoan culture, fa'asamoa, has changed since contact with Europeans, how, these changes have influenced Samoan people's perceptions and use of alcohol, and the role alcohol now plays in Samoan social life. Moreover, the thesis documents the social history of alcohol in Samoa since the nineteenth century, and explores the roles of some of the Europeans in shaping Samoan people's attitudes and behaviours towards alcohol and its use. Additionally, it examines the commercial and political economic interests of early European agencies in Samoa such as beachcombers, traders, colonial administrators, and missionaries which impacted on and influenced, to a considerable extent, Samoan people's drinking patterns. The study uses a qualitative methodological approach, utilizing qualitative interviewing as the main method of gathering data and various other methods to supplement the data. The sample population included Samoan men and women, of various religious denominations, drinkers and abstainers, born and raised in Samoa and in New Zealand. Unstructured interviews with thirty-nine participants, and eight key informants were conducted in Apia, Auckland, and Christchurch. The key informants included: a bishop of the Church of Latter Day Saints, the Samoan Police Commissioner, and the Secretary of the Samoan Liquor Authority who were interviewed in Apia; a pastor/lecturer of the Congregational Christian Church of American Samoa who was interviewed in Pago Pago, American Samoa; while two Samoan-born medical health professionals, a pastor of the Congregational Christian Church of Samoa, and one New Zealand-born woman researcher were interviewed in Auckland. The study found that alcohol and the drinking of it has secured a place in the social life of Samoans in the islands and in migrant communities such as those in Auckland, and to a lesser extent, Christchurch. It also found that while older women's and men's experiences and attitudes to alcohol differ significantly, particularly those born and raised in the islands, some similarities in the attitudes and practices of younger people towards alcohol, especially those born- and raised in New Zealand have emerged.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420300 Cultural Studies::420307 Pacific cultural studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2171</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mosaic: a study of juxtaposition in literature, as an approach to Pound's Cantos and similar modern poems</field><field name="creator">Horrocks, Roger</field><field name="description">The principles of form in &#8216;mosaic&#8217; poems such as The Cantos, Paterson, Maximus, or even &#8216;The Waste Land,&#8217; are not yet clearly understood. Criticism needs to bring its various ideas of &#8216;musical form,&#8217; &#8216;non-linear form,&#8217; or &#8216;the poem as a field of forces&#8217; into sharper focus. Mosaic poems are characterized by sudden changes of direction, heightened contrasts of style and texture, a complex use of quotation, and strange effects of fluidity where the usual distinction between the &#8216;tenor&#8217; and &#8216;vehicle&#8217; of metaphors is dissolved. To decide what features (if any) of the modern mosaic poem are new, the thesis examines possible precedents: so-called &#8216;pre-logical&#8217; poetry, the associationism of Romantic poetry, Leaves of Grass, Rimbaud&#8217;s poems, Mallarm&#233;&#8217;s Un coup de d&#233;s, etc. the work of European avant-garde poets of the 1910s (Apollinaire, Cendrars, Marinetti, et al.) is considered in detail, and the supposed originality of Pound and Eliot&#8217;s poetry is somewhat diminished when it is viewed against this European background. Nevertheless Pound and Eliot do contribute some technical innovations, particularly in the way their poetry combines &#8216;hard&#8217; and &#8216;soft&#8217; textures (to use Pound&#8217;s terms). The thesis examines Pound&#8217;s special &#8216;breakthrough&#8217; in 1919, and also the close interaction between his work and Eliot&#8217;s during this period &#8211; the two men advancing &#8216;like mountaineers roped together.' Mosaic poems demand a new style of &#8216;reading by field.&#8217; Criticism needs to develop ways of talking about the experience of discontinuity as sensitively as it now deals with continuity. Approaches to The Cantos that emphasize &#8216;ideogrammic logic&#8217; tend to be over-intellectual and not able to deal adequately with the more fluid or discontinuous aspects of the poem. The thesis explores the procedures of mosaic poetry, its various styles of &#8216;jumping&#8217; (to use Robert Bly&#8217;s term), ways of using fragments evocatively, and ways in which gaps or silences in a poem can be charged with meaning. Since collage is an important feature of mosaic poetry, the thesis attempts to survey this development historically, distinguishing it in some respects from traditional styles of quotation and allusion. The mosaic poem is compared and contrasted with earlier types of poem-sequence. The doubts expressed by Eliot, Tate, and other critics about the coherence of the modern long poem are answered by such essays as &#8216;Dr Williams&#8217; Position&#8217; in which Pound proposes new ideas of order. But Pound&#8217;s poetic practice was still more subtle than his theory, a discrepancy also noted in Eliot&#8217;s work. The thesis looks cautiously at the analogy often drawn between mosaic poetry and modern painting or film-making. It also examines the ways in which the music of pre-modern composers such as Bach and Beethoven has been used as a formal model by mosaic poets. The thesis offers a detailed analysis of &#8216;Canto XLVII&#8217; as a critical experiment in analyzing the reader&#8217;s temporal experience of mosaic poetry, his &#8216;shifting gestalts&#8217; as he explores the &#8216;field&#8217; of the poem. The analysis seeks to clarify the way in which The Cantos combines &#8216;Imagist&#8217; hardness with the fluidity of Symbolist poetry.</field><field name="date">1976</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420100 Language Studies::420101 English</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2093</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of the problem solving strategies used in family discussion groups</field><field name="creator">Everts, Johannes F.</field><field name="description">This investigation was inspired by Carkhuff's postulated that the principles which underlie effective counseling are equally pertinent to everyday human relationships &#8211; such as one may observe in the family. Carkhuff has not articulated this postulate in any detail and the present investigation both develops the notion of family problem solving strategies and tests it out in a practical situation. The development of this notion of family problem solving strategies begins with an integration of Carkhuff's model of the counseling process with similar models put forward by other authors. This is followed by a detailed analysis of family problem solving strategies as reported in the literature, and collation of data from both sources into a so-called Family Transaction Model (FTM). This Model consists of a series of distinctive though related parameters of family problem solving which include inner feelings, listening, self-expression, conflict management, the determination and execution of action plans, and the roles adopted by family members. Each parameter is defined in terms of specific behaviours or skills, postulated as necessary for effective problem solving. This FTM is then subjected to empirical validation in a comprehensive field study using 75 members of 18 complete nuclear families. A factor analysis of data derived from videotaped family discussions shows up two distinctive factors, "supportive involvement" and "distracting involvement"; these cover the parameters postulated above albeit in modified format. The main measurement variables involved have satisfactory inter-examiner and test-retest reliability. The FTM plus ancillary measures is shown to be highly effective in discriminating between parents and children; the former virtually embody the characteristics of supportive involvement while the latter show its obverse or distracting involvement. The Model also differentiates between male and female parents and, to a lesser extent, between male and female children. But it does not differentiate between family groups defined as troubled or untroubled on the basis of their referral to some helping agency or their mutual ratings of problem solving effectiveness. The format used for this assessment phase of the investigation also demonstrates the viability of using questionnaire ratings to ascertain family problem solving strategies, the value of family group discussion of real issues as a means to gather diagnostic data, and the inhibiting effects of videotape recording on the interview behaviour of participants. Finally the FTM is used as basis for a short-term treatment programme of 4 further sessions, such as might be undertaken by community resource personnel who have limited time and skill. This programme proves ineffective in changing observed interview behaviour, though participants report beneficial changes in attitude, mutual understanding and family relationships outside the interview situation. The results further suggest that the FTM is a viable basis for a treatment programme but that it is too comprehensive for success to be achieved in so few sessions, that therapists require extensive prior experience and training, that family members need to be flexibly involved in treatment, and that the entire programme needs to be carefully planned with a high degree of structure in the initial stages. The results of the present study as a whole provide a basis for further investigation including the validation of the FTM with a wide range of family groups, the development of more comprehensive rating scales, modifications in the assessment interview&#8217;s format, the development of a more effective treatment programme, and the development of an appropriate training programme for community resource personnel.</field><field name="date">1978</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education::330100 Education Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2094</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Protective mechanisms in New Zealand liverworts</field><field name="creator">Hooijmaijers, Cornelis Antonius Maria.</field><field name="description">Liverworts were the first plants to successfully make the transition from water to land and thus had to develop morphological and physiological features to overcome novel environmental constraints. The relative simple structure of liverworts in comparison to vascular plants implies that they have to combat environmental stress at a cellular level. Liverworts are an important part of the New Zealand flora. Leafy liverworts such as Jamesoniella colorata, Isotachis lyallii and Lepidolaena taylorii display a spectacular range in colouration within a single population. The leaves can vary from pale green in shaded habitats to bright red in more exposed places. A thalloid species, Monoclea forsteri, lacks such pigmentation but it might possess some unique cellular features to deal with stressful conditions. This thesis aims to study the cellular characteristics that allow liverworts to cope with extreme environmental conditions, with emphasis on (red) auxiliary pigments. Genetic analysis of liverwort populations revealed a highly clonal structure, which suggests that red colouration of liverwort leaves is a phenotypic response, and not a result of genotypic differences. Indeed, the red pigment could be induced in I. lyallii at relatively modest irradiance levels. The red leaves absorbed about 10% more photosynthetically active radiation than green leaves from the same species. Although the chemical characteristics of the red pigment remained elusive, it has light attenuation characteristics similar to anthocyanins in vascular plants. Its cellular location inside the cell wall is ideal for intercepting potentially damaging light quanta and can thereby protect the underlying chloroplasts from high light fluxes. The light energy that is absorbed by the red pigment did not translate into an enhanced protection from chilling-stress through leaf warming. The photosynthetic apparatus of liverworts has acclimated to the environmental conditions that these plants are most likely to experience in their habitat. Gametophytes from shady environments had lower chlorophyll a to b ratios than gametophytes found in sunnier places. This illustrates the need for a more efficient light-harvesting system in the former to collect all of the available light. In addition, plants from sunny environments had lower chlorophyll to carotenoid ratios than plants found in shady environments, which suggests that the photoprotective properties of carotenoids are better developed in the former. This was confirmed by measurements of chlorophyll a fluorescence which clearly showed a greater potential for nonphotochemical quenching in gametophytes from exposed habitats than gametophytes found in sheltered places, both during high light treatment and desiccation. A better developed photo-protective system (i.e. non-photochemical processes and lightscreening pigments) allowed the red-leaved gametophytes to better deal with high light stress as well as desiccation than their green-leaved counterparts. Measurements of photosynthetic responses revealed that red gametophytes were photoinhibited less and their recovery was more complete from a high light treatment of 1800 &#956;mol/m2/s than the greens. Similarly, measurements of photosynthetic responses and oxidative damage indicated that the red morph was better protected from high light fluxes that occur during drought-stress than the green morph. Determination of cell water relations showed that the red pigment in J. colorata did not influence the water balance during drought. In conclusion, this study has presented evidence that liverworts from exposed habitats are better equipped to deal with abiotic stressors such as high light and dehydration than liverworts from more sheltered environments. Changes in pigment composition, concentration and location are likely to play an important role in liverwort protection from environmental stress &#8211; most noticeably a red pigment with photo-protective attributes.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270400 Botany</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2095</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The ecology, population dynamics, and energetics of some soft shore molluscs</field><field name="creator">Larcombe, M.

In the past thirty years studies of community and population ecology of marine soft-shore invertebrates have increased, both in number and in depth, A good knowledge is building up of the interactions of benthic invertebrates with their physical and biotic environments.

Similar work has not been frequently attempted for molluscs, although there is some information available from syntheses of the work of different authors on the same species.(Bullock, 1955; Dehnel, 1955; Fretter and Graham, 1962; Hyman, 1967 ; Prosser , 1955; Wilbur and Yonge, 1966;) Most authors have concentrated either on the ecology of a species, or on the population dynamics of one population, or perhaps on the influence of one environmental factor, such as temperature, on one parameter, such as growth rate; rarely has there been a study of the interaction of several environmental factors with several population parameters .

General Introduction 1.1 Aims of this work.  The broad object of this work has been to improve understanding of shallow water marine environments and their faunal associations. To this end, information has been integrated from a number of specific investigations which were: 1. To examine the benthic macrofauna associated with sedimentary deposits, in an area with steep environmental gradients and associated complexity of faunal distributions. 2. To identify and describe the major benthic marofaunal associations, using both classical &#8220;intuitive" methods and more objective statistical methods employing computer techniques. 3. To investigate the hydrological and sedimentary features of the local environment, as a background to the faunal investigations.  4. To relate the distribution of the fauna and associations ;a selected environmental parameters, with particular reference to the grain-size characteristics of the sediments. 5. To relate the faunal associations to similar associations elsewhere in New Zealand and overseas. 6. To investigate the relationships between the living fauna and the dead remains of organisms found in the sediments, with the view to providing information which may be usefull to paleaecologists. 7. To try to portray certain aspects of the underwater environment difficult to appreciate by means other than diving.</field><field name="date">1972</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270500 Zoology</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270700 Ecology and Evolution::270702 Marine and estuarine ecology (incl. marine ichthyology)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2098</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The development of rapid freezing techniques, and their application to an electron microscopical study of phloem structure</field><field name="creator">Dempsey, Graeme Peter</field><field name="description">Preface This thesis is divided into two parts: Part I - The Use of Rapid Freezing Techniques to Study Unfixed, Non-Cryoprotected Animal and Plant Tissues by Freeze-Substitution and Freeze-Fracturing . Part II - The Distribution of P-Protein in Mature Sieve Elements of Phloem, and its Relation to Proposed Translocatory Mechanisms.  The ultrastructure of the sieve elements of the phloem has remained a controversial issue for many years, mainly because of the extreme sensitivity of the cells to manipulation and conventional electron microscopical fixation methods. It was thought that rapid freezing, in association with freeze-substitution or freeze-fracturing, would stabilise the tissue and provide an image of the sieve element as little removed as possible from the in vivo condition. Thus, it was necessary to utilise a technique which froze tissue extremely rapidly, so that the use of cryoprotectants could be avoided.  Therefore, the work reported in Part I of this thesis describes efforts to evaluate the available freezing techniques, and to adapt and test a suitable technique for the investigation of phloem ultrastructure. This technique, coupled with other conventional electron microscopical methods, is employed in Part II of this thesis to study the ultrastructure of mature sieve elements.</field><field name="date">1975</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270100 Biochemistry and Cell Biology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2099</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Design and evaluation of projects with variable labour response: case study of agricultural aid on Atiu</field><field name="creator">Bollard, Alan</field><field name="description">This thesis analyses producer response to technical change using agricultural aid projects on Atiu, Cook Islands, as an example.

Unimproved values for individual parcels of land are aggregated into 301 areal units and multiple regression analysis is used to explain the spatial pattern of values in 1970. Temporal variations in the pattern of unimproved values and the influence of increasing values on the distribution of agricultural land use are also explored. The study area comprise most of the territory over which the Auckland Regional Authority has jurisdiction. Both 'accessibility' and 'area-characteristics' models are used to interpret the pattern of unimproved values in 1970. In general the area-characteristics models are the most successful, but higher R2 values are achieved with hybrid models that combine road distance from the CBD modified by travel time, with such characteristics of areas as size of holding, land use, and terrain. In analysing the pattern of values in 1955, 1960, and 1365 compared with 1970, the statistical contribution of road distance to the CBD compared with terrain is stressed. Distance becomes a more effective predictor of value through time, while the explanation contributed by terrain-characteristics deteriorates. The large increases in the value of land that the region has experienced during the period studied are shown to have had less influence on the distribution of agriculture than has been suggested in other contexts. The main reasons advanced for the resilience of agriculture is its ability to compete for land, which is influenced by legislation allowing the postponement of rates (territorial local authority land taxes) on some agricultural land. The means by which quotas are allocated to farmers supplying liquid milk, and the marketing of fruit and vegetables direct to consumers, are also important in maintaining agricultural land in production.</field><field name="date">1976</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::260000 Earth Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2103</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Transient effects in geothermal convective systems.</field><field name="creator">Horne, Roland Nicholas</field><field name="description">This work is a detailed analysis of the transient behaviour of geothermal convective systems.

Although I have concentrated on the poetry, I have also ranged freely over the published writing of all these men. My conclusions can be reduced to these two propositions: 1. That the significance of a literary city can be understood only in conjunction with an attempt to explore the significance of other literary landscapes. 2. The significance of the city (and other landscapes) as metaphor is to be understood in terms of a basic process whereby the self is realized. This process is most simply represented geographically by a pattern of withdrawal and return, with the city and wilderness figuring as poles between which the self moves. The second proposition can be elaborated as follows: The process begins with the individual in a condition of alienation from his culture. This is culture, not just as a system of meaning and value, but culture as a way in which experience is ordered. At this point in the process, the city becomes a metaphor for the structures whereby a culture orders its common experience. The most basic ground for social alienation is that these structures serve to cut the individual off from experience. The response to this alienation is a desire to undergo a reductive process whereby orientative structures are simplified or demolished. The aim of such a process, which has a corresponding metaphor in the geographical metaphor of withdrawal, is to restore contact with experience. The experiential world is characterized by the absence of structure. Its cardinal metaphor is nature as wilderness (wildness), though, again, the city as oceanic and dislocative can fulfil a like function. It is in the unmediated intercourse with such a world that the self is realized. At this point a sense of meaning and value arises as experience is assimilated and integrated. The result of such an integration is a structure valid for the self&#8212;a structure, we might note, with no claims to permanence or finality. What is discovered in the wilderness is not so much a final structure, as a way of structuring. Which is what the realized individual brings back to the society from which he remains alienated. As the city can serve as metaphor for social structures, so it can serve as a metaphor for the structure (and the way of structuring) that might be--an ideal city. The final task is the discovery of a role that might facilitate the realization of this authentic culture.</field><field name="date">1976</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420100 Language Studies::420101 English</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2105</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Interhemispheric transfer in a marsupial : a behavioural investigation of interhemispheric transfer of visual information in Trichosurus vulpecula</field><field name="creator">Webster, Donald MacDonald</field><field name="description">Eight marsupial phalangers, (Trichosurus vulpecula) with mid-saggital section of the optic chiasma were trained monocularly in a visual discrimination task, as were four which had, in addition, mid-saggital sections of the anterior commissure, fasciculus aberrans and hippocampal commissure. All were tested for transfer to the untrained hemisphere. The results showed that those with the commissures intact transferred information to the hemisphere not trained directly, while those with commissures sectioned did not. It appears that transfer of visual information between cerebral hemispheres can take place in an animal which lacks a corpus callosum, and that the forebrain commissures may be the functional equivalent, in this marsupial, of the corpus callosum in eutherians. A further eight animals received mid-saggital section of the optic chiasma. Two had all other interhemispheric pathways intact, two had mid-saggital section of fasciculus aberrans and hippocampal and anterior commissures, two had fasciculus aberrans only sectioned, and two had fasciculus aberrans only intact. All were trained monocularly in a visual discrimination task and tested for transfer to the opposite hemisphere. Those with all commissural pathways intact and those with only fasciculus aberrans intact demonstrated transfer. Those with all commissures sectioned and those with only fasciculus aberrans sectioned did not show transfer. It seems probable that integrity of fasciculus aberrans is a necessary and sufficient commissural condition for interhemispheric transfer of visual information in this marsupial.</field><field name="date">1975</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2106</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effect of orthogonality and antisymmetrisation in the strong-coupling model of nuclear cluster reactions</field><field name="creator">Thompson, Ian Joseph</field><field name="description">The possibility and feasibility is investigated of including in the modelling of nuclear cluster reactions a unified treatment of the effects both of the non-orthogonalities between transfer channels, and of the antisymmetrisation required by the Pauli Principle. The deuteron - nucleus interaction, the simplest cluster reaction, is considered in detail within the Coupled Channels framework. The Coupled Channels formalism was chosen because it accurately handles inelastic and transfer couplings of arbitary strengths. The fact that transfer channels are orthogonal to each other only asymptotically is taken into account by reallocating the wave function in the internal region, from the deuteron channels to the transfer channels, taking components from the deuteron channels in ways exactly analogous to the way the antisymmetrisation requirements remove blocked deuteron-core components. Thus a unified treatment of the two effects is facilitated. It is found further that when all possible transfer channels are included, along with all Pauli blockings from the core nucleons, then under certain conditions at low energies, the wave function in the deuteron channel is small and oscillatory in the internal region, leaving the deuteron as a cluster to have largely asymptotic significance. In this limit, the exact non-local potential governing the deuteron channel simplifies considerably in one approximation to be replaceable by just several orthogonality conditions, and these are easily modelled in solving the coupled equations for the radial wave functions. This simplified and unified model has the advantage, since the deuteron's internal wave form is significant only asymptotically, of allowing automatically for arbitary deuteron polarisation by the core (though not vice-versa). Furthermore, the asymptotic matching is not at a fixed radius as in R-matrix theory, but is a continuous process that depends on the binding energies of the actual proton &amp; neutron bound states in the residual nucleus.</field><field name="date">1979</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::240000 Physical Sciences::240300 Atomic and Molecular Physics; Nuclear and Particle Physics, Plasma Physics::240302 Nuclear and particle physics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2108</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The aqueous radiation chemistry of cysteamine and some related compounds</field><field name="creator">Sims, Ritchie John</field><field name="description">The radiation chemistry of cysteamine and of cysteamine-S- phosphoric acid in oxygen-free and oxygenated solution has been studied at acidic and near-neutral pH.

From measurements of the dependence of G(-RSH), G(RSSR), and G(H2O2) upon pH and cysteamine concentration, suggestions regarding the stoichiometry of the chain reaction occurring at higher pH and the mechanistic implications have been made. The dependence of the rate of oxidation of cysteamine by hydrogen peroxide upon pH has been studied, second-order kinetics being observed over the pH range 6.5 to 10.9, and the rate has been found to depend in a simple manner upon ionisation of the thiol. The rate constant of the reaction of aquated electrons with cysteamine-S-phosphoric acid has been measured as about 5 x 109 M-1 sec-1 by competition with cysteamine at pH 4.2, and measurements have indicated the formation of orthophosphate, inorganic phosphorothioate, and an aldehyde as products of the reaction of hydroxyl radicals with cysteamine-S-phosphoric acid at pH 8.6.</field><field name="date">1972</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2109</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Solvent extraction of cobalt and nickel carboxylates</field><field name="creator">Woollard, Gerald Andrew</field><field name="description">This thesis is concerned with the solvent extraction of ternary complexes of cobalt(II) and nickel(II). In a preliminary survey, the extraction of nickel(II) by a variety of systems containing carboxylic acids in the presence of 1,2-diaminoethanes was investigated in order to determine the extent to which these complexes extract into different solvents. The aromatic carboxylic acids studied were benzoic, p-toluic, phenylacetic, cinnamic, anthranilic and salicylic acid while the aliphatic acids studied were butanoic, hexanoic, octanoic, decanoic, dodecanoic, 2-bromohexanoic, 2-brom&#246;octanoic, chloroacetic and 2-chloropropanoic acid. The 1,2-diaminoethane used in conjunction with these acids were ethylenediamine, 1,2-diaminopropane, 1,2-diamino-2-methylpropane, 1,2-diaminocyclohexane, N,N'-diaminoethylenediamine, N,N-diaminoethylenediamine and N,N,N',N'-tetramethylethylenediamine. Of the aromatic ternary systems studied, salicylic acid with either 1,2-diaminocyclohexane or a N-substituted diamine were found to give the highest extraction. These were then investigated in depth to determine the number and nature of the extracted species. Unlike the aromatic acids, the longer chain n-carboxylic acids are capable of quantitative extraction in the absence of a diamine. During the course of this part of the project it therefore became necessary to investigate the extraction of nickel(II) both by the acids alone and by the acids in combination with a diamine. It was found that the inclusion of a diamine had little influence on the pH of extraction. Finally, the extraction of cobalt(II) by combination of salicylic acid and N,N'-dimethylethylenediamine and N,N,N',N'-tetramethylethylenediamine and by decanoic acid alone were investigated. The behaviour of cobalt(II) and nickel(II) in equivalent systems were compared in order to assess the degree of separation obtainable.</field><field name="date">1977</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2110</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Nitrosyl complexes of ruthenium and osmium</field><field name="creator">Laing, Kerry Richard</field><field name="description">This study concerns the synthesis, structure and reactivity of nitrosyl complexes of ruthenium and osmium. Attempts have been made to prepare coordinatively saturated and unsaturated complexes and a study of their oxidative addition reactions bears considerable resemblance to the more familiar carbonyl complexes M(CO)3(PPh3)2. A number of interesting atom transfer reactions, generally involving oxygen, have been observed. The d8 complex RuCl(CO)(NO)(PPh3)2 results from the interaction of RuHCl(CO)(PPh3)3 with N-methyl-N-nitrosotoluene-p-sulphonamide. The labile halide ligand is readily displaced by a large range of anions and it is believed that both linear and bent nitrosyl linkages may exist for different members of this series. The structures of these complexes are discussed in the light of recent X-ray crystal structure data. Halogens and hydrogen halides add to give the familiar RuX3(NO)(PPh3)2; RuCl3(NO)(PPh2Me)2 is prepared in a direct reaction and also by phosphine exchange and 1H n.m.r. data confirm that the phosphine ligands are trans. The complexes RuX(CO)(NO)(PPh3)2 react readily with O2 to form the dioxygen complexes Ru(O2)X(NO)(PPh3)2. Halogens and hydrogen halides produce RuX3(NO)(PPh3)2. The dioxygen complexes react with SO2 and N2O4 to give sulphato and dinitrato complexes respectively. The reaction with CO results in the intramolecular oxidation of the nitrosyl group to coordinated nitrate accompanied by the incorporation of two moles of CO, i.e. RuX(NO3)(CO)2(PPh3)2 is formed. The dioxygen complexes catalytically oxidise triphenylphosphine or triphenylarsine to the respective oxides and RuX(NO)(PPh3)2 can be isolated from this cycle. Reactions of these four-coordinated complexes with O2, CO, Cl2 and NOBF4 are recorded. The dinitrosyl complex Ru(NO)2(PPh3)2 is reported from a number of syntheses, the most successful being via a ligand reaction when RuCl2(CO)2(PPh3)2 is heated with NaNO2 and Ph3P in dimethyl formamide. The P-tolyldiphenylphosphine analogue is also reported and the mono-substituted product Ru(NO)2(PPh3)[P(OPh)3] is produced in an exchange reaction between Ru(NO)2(PPh3)2 and excess triphenylphosphite. This phosphite complex reacts with Ph3P and O2 to produce Ru(O2)(NO2)(NO)PPh3)2 by an atom transfer process. Ru(NO)2(PPh3)2 reacts with the acids HY (Y = BF4, PF6, ClO4) and O2 to give the dinitrosyl cations [Ru(OH)(NO)2(PPh3)2]+Y- in which the two nitrosyl groups are structurally and electronically inequivalent. [RuCl(NO)2(PPh3)2]BF4 is reported and reactions of these dinitrosyl cations with halide ions to give RuX2(NO3)(NO)(PPh3)2, with intramolecular oxidation of the NO group, are also described. OsCl2(OH)(NO)(PPh3)2 reacts irreversibly with alcohols to form OsCl2(OR)(NO)(PPh3)2 (R = CH3, C2H5, n-C3H7, (CH3O)CH2CH2) which readily undergo hydride abstraction to form OsHCl2(NO)(PPh3)2. Sodium borohydride converts this complex to the trihydrido species OsH3(NO)(PPh3)2 and if the reaction is performed in the presence of Ph3P, OsH(NO)(PPh3)3 results. The coordinated perchlorate complex OsHCl(OClO3)(NO)(PPh3)2 results form the reaction of OsHCl2(NO)(PPh3)2 with silver perchlorate; this is readily reversed by chloride ions or the solvents CH2Cl2 and CHCl3. This perchlorato complex also arises from the reaction of OsH(CO)(NO)(PPh3)2 with HClO4 and a related tetrafluoroborato complex, OsH(OC2H5)(FBF3)(NO)(PPh3)2 by substituting HBF4. This complex reacts with Ph3P to give [OsH(OH)(NO)(PPh3)3]BF4, CO to give [Os(CO)2(NO)(PPh3)2]BF4 and LiX (X = Br, I) to give OsHX2(NO)(PPh3)2. OsHCl(OClO3)(NO)(PPh3)2 reacts with NaOH in methanol, in the presence of O2 to produce Os(O2)Cl(NO)(PPh3)2. This dioxygen complex is far less stable than the ruthenium analogue but it undergoes similar reactions. Ph3P is oxidised, SO2 and CO give sulphato and a nitratodicarbonyl complex respectively. Infra-red, 1H n.m.r., conductivity, molecular weight data and elemental analysis have been used in formulation and structural assignment.</field><field name="date">1972</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences::250600 Theoretical and Computational Chemistry::250603 Reaction kinetics and dynamics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2111</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Engelhard of Konrad von W&#252;rzburg: its structure and its sources</field><field name="creator">Oettli, Peter H., 1940-</field><field name="description">Introduction.

C. J.</field><field name="description">The city of Auckland in 1885 was free from the depression which had troubled the greater part of the colony of New Zealand since the early years of the decade. There had been a buoyant economic atmosphere for some time. The main local bodies of the city were carrying out an expansionist public works programme. Many new public companies had been formed in recent years. The city and suburbs were visibly growing as the building of houses, shops and commercial blocks went on at a rapid tempo. By early 1886, however, the prosperity had gone. Auckland passed into as harsh a decade as any experienced in the one hundred and thirty years of its European existence. Bankruptcies multiplied and were found in high and unexpected places. Firms imagined to be of unquestioned solidity fell. Large local companies were forced to liquidate: there was usually little left over for division among shareholders who had taken up holdings in more confident days. Thousands of properties fell into the hands of mortgagees.  Few were aware of how serious and general was the business collapse until October 1888 when a shareholders&#8217; committee of the Bank of New Zealand presented an alarming report. It disclosed that the heavy losses of the Bank were relatively far worse in Auckland than elsewhere and went on to censure much of the business carried on in the city and province. Since the Bank of New Zealand had long been regarded as an Auckland institution and its board invariably drawn from prominent businessmen of the city, this report reflected adversely upon the existing commercial practices, and the leadership of the city. But if there were &#8216;guilty men&#8217; as the report suggested, they were never brought to trial, nor were their names revealed except in the vaguest terms. The Banking Committee set up by the House of Representatives in 1896, failed to persuade Bank directors to name either the weak accounts, or the inadequate securities that the Bank had accepted in Auckland and the Waikato. Bank spokesmen were as tight-lipped as any private banker in Zurich. The facts were not revealed nor have been since. Yet the charges made in 1888 have generally stuck. It has been believed that influential Aucklanders did much to keep their city in a state of artificial prosperity.  This thesis grew out of intermittent research into Auckland&#8217;s economic development in the 1880s that I began in 1956. Since 1964 I have more seriously and continuously studied the businessmen of the decade. I soon found explanations of the boom and collapse invariably moralistic and generally unsatisfactory. Rarely did demonological trappings fit the businessmen when studied in detail. I became convinced that the sudden growth of the city and the related economic expansion were primarily economic phenomena that had primarily economic explanations. Where I have been able I have turned in my research to business records. The Sir John Logan Campbell Papers at the Auckland Institute Library were extremely valuable. But records of firms were all too few. I relied most heavily on quite unspectacular documents: the daily press, and the records of the land registries in Auckland and Hamilton and the companies&#8217; office in Auckland. Newspapers reported company business very fully in those days. The press invariably carried prospectuses, and had detailed accounts of company meetings. Annual reports, financial statements and shareholders&#8217; discussions at an important company meeting might run into thousands of words. Bankruptcy proceedings, and civil actions in court, moreover, were given far more detailed press coverage than today and tell us much about how the less successful and more litigious conducted their affairs.  Lands and deeds records I found exceptionally valuable. With some persistence and a little luck one can reconstruct much of the borrowing of the men whose names the Bank of New Zealand refused to reveal, and other businessmen as well. The key was usually a legal description of one piece of land of the person concerned often to be gained from the General Assembly electoral rolls. Deeds and memoranda of mortgage and transfer I found very rewarding. An unexpected bonus from Certificate of Title Register Books were maps that gave the means of establishing the dimensions of estates that usually described in very general and often erroneous terms.  The virtually unused company records stored in the National Archives Record Centre at Auckland proved to be a mine of information. Records of the old law firms and banks where available proved very valuable but the position of professional trust in which the lawyer and the banker stand in relation to clients&#8217; records must inevitably limit the opportunities of the historian to participate.</field><field name="date">1969</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::430000 History and Archaeology::430100 Historical Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2113</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Les formules exclamatives dans les farces (1450-1550): le parler expressif entre en sc&#232;ne</field><field name="creator">Weir, Andrew</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">1992</field><field name="language">fr</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420200 Literature Studies::420209 French</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2114</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of biological disturbance in determining the organisation of sub-tidal encrusting communities in temperate waters</field><field name="creator">Ayling, Tony, 1947-</field><field name="description">Biological disturbance was found to be one of the most important mechanisms control1ing community organisation in the temperate sub-tidal region. The different types of biological disturbance structuring three encrusting communities were investigated on the east coast of Northland, New Zealand. The operation of each type was determined and the rate of disturbance measured. Experimental exclusion treatments were set up to demonstrate the effects of the major disturbance agents on community structure. The urchin Evechinus chloroticus was the most abundant agent of biological disturbance and affected the widest spectrum of encrusting organisms. The abundant balistid fish Navodon scaber was another major agent of biological disturbance in this region. Disturbance of algal populations also resulted from a guild of abundant herbivorous gastropods. Two episodes of fungal/bacterial infection degraded numbers of the large sponges Ancorina alata and Polymastia fusca. The operation of the different disturbance agents was found to be generally unpredictable in both time and space. There was no escape from biological disturbance for encrusting organisms in either small or large size. Re-occupation processes on patches of free primary space were investigated both experimentally and by using settlement plates (artificial free space patches). Recruitment was found to be irregular in space and time, especially for long-lived sessile organisms. Settlement processes as well as growth and mortality of newly settled organisms were investigated with a view to understanding community development. Only one verifiable example of substrate preparation or biological succession was found to operate in the communities studied. It is postulated that community organisation is flexible and not rigidly directed along a single successional pathway. Multiple developmental pathways and multiple stable configurations are possible in the same locality, resulting from the operation of different disturbance regimes.</field><field name="date">1976</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270500 Zoology::270504 Invertebrate biology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2115</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Aspects of the reactivities of co-ordinated malonate, oxalate and carbonate</field><field name="creator">Rands, David Barrett</field><field name="description">The acid catalysed aquation of potassium trismalonatochromium(III) and potassium bismalonatodiaquochromium(III) have been studied. Almost linear plots of log kobs against the Hammett acidity function were interpreted as being due to an A-1 mechanism operating. Two kinetically different types of co-ordinated oxygen were found in a study of the oxygen exchange between the trisoxalatocobalt(III) anion and 0-18 enriched water. The carbonyl, or outer, oxygen atoms are thought to exchange by an A-2 bimolecular mechanism, while the carboxyl, or inner, oxygen atoms are thought to exchange indirectly by co-ordination of enriched oxalate groups to the cobalt centre during the anation reaction of the bisoxalatodiaquocobalt(III) ion. Finally, oxygen exchange reactions between 0-18 enriched water and various carbonato-ammine cobalt(III) complexes were studied, and it was found that generally the three oxygen atoms of the co-ordinated carbonate exchanged at equal rates, an exception being in the case of the carbonatobis(o-phenanthroline)Co(III) ion where the outer, carbonyl, oxygen exchanged faster than the inner, metal-bound, oxygen atoms. The first of these two groups has been interpreted in terms of a fast, reversible one ended dissociation process occurring, which is much faster than oxygen exchange, and the latter case in terms of a rate determining one ended dissociation step.</field><field name="date">1972</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2116</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Byron's Plays: An interpretative study</field><field name="creator">Sharkey, Michael, 1946-</field><field name="description">This dissertation examines the eight dramas which Lord Byron wrote in Italy, to evaluate this motives in writing plays, and to trace his views on various fields. The plays are discussed individually in some detail. The Introductory Chapter indicates the status of the theatre in Byron's time, and distinguished "poetic" dramas from plays written with a view to the stage. Byron's idea of a "mental theatre" is indicated, together with his involvement in the production of dramas as a member of the Drury Lane Management Committee. Chapter Two: Manfred, Byron's first play, written in 1817, is seen as a development from Gothic drama; a closer examination suggests Byron described the world in dualistic terms. The eponymous protagonist defies the claims of the "evil Principle in propria persona." Promethean aspects of the hero are indicated, and auto-biographical elements in the play are considered. Chapter Three: Marino Faliero is seen as a "political" drama, in which the tragic protagonist identifies the State as the oppressor of individual rights. The Doge Faliero's "traditional" code of ethics is opposed by a revolutionist ethic which he adopts in order to crush the State. Byron suggests the Doge is used by both the State and his revolutionary allies as a figurehead; the Doge's character is investigated, and Byron's involvement in political affairs is briefly examined to show any political motive in his writing the play. Chapter Four: Sardanapalus explores the idea of a humane ruler condemned by his subjects as too "soft," and deposed by traditional elements in the army and state religion. Byron's skeptical and "liberal" views are indicated. Chapter Five: The Two Foscari shows the "suppressed passions" operating against a political current. Byron is seen to question assumptions concerning "duty" and patriotism, along lines explored in the two preceding neoclassical plays. Chapter Six: Cain. Byron's most controversial play is seen as an attempt to define man's relationships to God and nature. Byron takes up earlier suggestions in his plays of a dualist view of the universe, and expatiates on his sceptic views. A notion of the mind's self-sufficiency, outlined in Manfred, is further developed. Chapter Seven: Heaven and Earth provides further definition of man's place in an ostensibly hostile universe. Japhet, the "hero" of the drama, is confounded by the apparent indiscriminateness of God's punishment of man in the Flood. The notion of plural worlds, suggested in earlier works, and particularly in Cain is again utilised. Chapter Eight: Werner. In Byron's most "theatrical" work, an inheritance of guilt is reviewed to suggest the notion of a "damned world." Byron's deliberate melodramatic structuring of Werner, and his concern with psychological investigation of notive are examined. Chapter Nine: The Deformed Transformed. Byron's last, unfinished, play provides a recapitulation of themes of the earlier plays and looks forward to the style and concerns of Don Juan. Byron is most "inventive" and unrestrained in this drama that abrogates all the classical unities and appears to work toward an endorsement of the idea of salvation by act of will. The concluding chapter relates Byron's view of the universe that emerges form the dramas considered separately and together. The particular aims of each play, and the stylistic features of each, which defy general statements about an overall ambition, are recapitulated. Byron's reasons for choosing dramatic form are briefly sketched in light of the investigation of individual works. His concern to experiment, and to avoid prescription, is seen as indicating a possible mode of operation for a revival of the English drama in the Romantic era.</field><field name="date">1976</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420200 Literature Studies::420204 British and Irish</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2117</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Scattering Effects in Long Distance Radio Propagation</field><field name="creator">Bannister, Richard Ward, 1941-</field><field name="description">It is well known that the ionosphere is not a uniform and homogeneous medium.

The content of the following pages is the result of a research project originally concerned solely with Dutch translations of Shakespeare&#8217;s plays; but even in its preliminary stages &#8211; the collecting of copies and data &#8211; it became evident that the field was far too wide to be done justice in one single short-term study. Between the middle of the seventeenth century and the present day more than fifty Dutch authors have busied themselves with the translation or adaptation of Shakespeare&#8217;s plays. It might have been feasible to subject the work of one of these to detailed scrutiny, or to devote a less thorough, but still fairly comprehensive analysis to half a dozen of them. But such a study would have taken shape in a vacuum: since, to date, little academic research on this topic has been undertaken by Dutch scholars and, to my knowledge, none whatsoever in the English-speaking world, there would be no way of relating the findings on any one translator or any one limited set of translators to the merits of their many colleagues, to the cultural environment in which his or her work was conceived, and to the historical perspective of these efforts. Hence, the project developed, firstly, towards the establishment of such a historical and cultural perspective and, secondly, towards viewing the problem of translating Shakespeare into Dutch in general terms, and in a framework that would accommodate, in a cursory way, at least all those translators whose work has been &#8211; and in many cases still is &#8211; accessible to the Dutch public of this century, either in published versions or in performance on the stage.  The historical and cultural perspective. The first thirteen chapters, therefore, contain only a limited amount of material on translations. A few pages of Chapter I are devoted to an isolated seventeenth-century version of The Taming of the Shrew; Chapters III and IV are concerned, respectively, with a set of eighteenth-century prose translations and with the classicist French and German derivates of some Shakespearean plays that were translated into Dutch and performed in the Netherlands, in some cases, until less than a century ago; Chapters VII and VIII deal briefly with a dozen nineteenth-century translators whose work, but for that of one of them (L. A. J. Burgersdijk), is of historical interest only. Finally, Chapter XI introduces the efforts of twentieth-century translators, which come under closer scrutiny in the second part of the study. Had this work been submitted to a university in the Netherlands, a brief reference to texts by scholars such as Dr. R. Pennink, Prof. Dr. B. Hunningher and Prof. Dr. H. H. J. de Leeuwe would have rendered the writing of Chapters II and V, as well as some sections of Chapters VI, IX and XII superfluous. These chapters and sections deal with the earliest reactions to Shakespeare by the world of Dutch letters &#8211; between the early eighteenth and mid-nineteenth centuries - , with the Dutch theatre of the past two centuries and with those who were concerned with, and involved in it as writers, critics and directors. However, this material is only accessible to Dutch readers, and must be assumed to be totally unfamiliar to their English counterparts and, for that reason, had to be summarised and incorporated in this study, even though my limited research period in the Netherlands &#8211; a little short of twelve months &#8211; left no scope for independent work on my part in these specialized fields. The same applies to the content of Chapter I: the movements of strolling players from England in the late sixteenth and early seventeenth century, and their effect on the dramaturgy and theatre history of The Netherlands and Germany.</field><field name="date">1972</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420200 Literature Studies::420214 Other European</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2119</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physiological and Behavioural Studies on the Ecology of some New Zealand Chitons</field><field name="creator">Boyle, Peter Robin</field><field name="description">Experiments on the responses to osmotic stress and desiccation are reported for several species of New Zealand littoral chitons. Qualitative and quantitative studies on the ecology of the common Auckland species have been undertaken, with special reference to microhabitat conditions. The micro-anatomy of the dorsal sensory organs has been studied, and related to the comparative responses to light stimuli, and experiments involving interference with these organs. Sypharochiton pelliserpentis was found t o be an osmo-conformer, showing only limited volume regulation but a wide tolerance to salinity fluctuations. Size of the animal had a negligible effect on the osmotic response, and it is likely that other chitons are osmo-conformers but with less tolerance of osmotic stress. Animals of this species were better able to resist the effects of desiccation than several other chitons. This resulted from a kinetic behaviour pattern in response to low humidities causing aggregation in the laboratory, and a well developed tolerance of extreme water loss, Sypharochiton Pelliserpentis colonises a wide rage of microhabitats on rock surfaces, some exposed to wide salinity changes (13.28&#176;/oo to 45 .80&#176;/ooS) between tides, and others exposed t o drying. Population size structures indicate that exposure t o desiccation is likely t o be more important than osmotic stress in controlling populations, and microhabitat more important than tidal level. The other chitons studied were restricted to pools, beneath boulders or to wave-splashed situations which did not dry. One very fast-moving chiton, Ischnochiton maorianus exhibited photo-negative orientation and the 'shadow response', the full range of reactions to light stimuli yet reported in chitons. It possesses only the megalaesthete type of dorsel sensory receptor. Experiments showed masking or abrading these organs to affect the rate of response, and it is concluded that at least one of their functions is light reception. Hithochiton neglectus, a species possessing well developed extra-pigmental ocelli, did not show such clear responses to light. Problems of the structure and function of these organs are discussed.</field><field name="date">1967</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270500 Zoology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2120</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Novel Products from Pentachlorocyclopropane: A Synthetic and Structural Investigation</field><field name="creator">Surman, Peter William John</field><field name="description">Primary and secondary amines react with pentachlorocyclopropane to form a variety of novel products. Amidines, allyl and cyclopropenyl cations are easily reached by these reactions. The 1,1,3,3-tetra-aminoallyl cations of this series can be reversibly protonated at C(2) to give diamidinium ions. Action of KOH on the diamidinium species CH2[C(NHBut)2]2 2+ produces the diamidine CH2[C(NBut)(NHBut)]2 which hydrolyses to the formamidine CH(NBut)(NHBut). Bis- and tris-amino substituted Cyclopropenylium ions are formed by the action of secondary amines on pentachlorocyclopropane. The cations of this study are stabilised by electron back-donation from nitrogen atoms of substituent groups- The subject of back-bonding was probed in several ways. crystallographically determined structures of representative salts afforded bond length data from which deductions about back-bonding were made. The measurement of barriers to bond rotation is another way that this effect was investigated. Using the technique of variable temperatue NMR, VT-NMR, spectroscopy, energies of activation about unsaturated bonds of allyl, amidinium and cyclopropenylium cations were found. UV-spectra provided additional information concerning bonding in these species. Tautomerism of N,N&#8217;-disubstituted amidines was investigated by VT-NMR spectroscopy. Individual tautomers were identified in NMR spectra (13C,1H). Tris-alkylaminocyclopropenylium ions were oxidised to form intensely coloured radical dications. The first Raman spectrum of a cyclopropenyl radical dication was determined. Using the technique of pulse radiolysis we were able to reduce the cyclopropenylium cation, [C3(Net2)3]+, to the molecular radical. Further, pulse experiments enabled standard reduction potentials of representative [C3(NR2)3]2+ and allyl radical dications to be measured and compared. In general, tertiary amines reacted with pentachlorocyclopropane to generate product mixtures. Reaction of para-dimethylaminopyridine, DMAP, on pentachlorocyclopropane was a case in exception. The novel allylide product is the same as that formed via an alternative route. The direct reaction of ammonia on pentachlorocyclopropane product several products including the formamidine NC-N=CH-NH2. A polyamide was prepared from the hydrolysis of a diamidinium ion. The mechanism of formation and the characterisation of this glossy, thermoplastic material is discussed.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2121</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Crystallographic studies of nitrosyl, isocyanide and dithiolate complexes of Group VIII metals</field><field name="creator">Whittle, Kenneth Rodney</field><field name="description">The present interest in organometallic nitrosyl complexes stems partly from their similarity with carbonyl analogues which are widely used as catalysts in industrial processes. The search for potential new catalysts among nitrosyl complexes is perhaps not surprising when it is realised that the nitrosonium ion (NO+), the species normally regarded as being co-ordinated, is isoelectronic with carbon monoxide. Further interest may be due to the fact that NO+ is also isoelectronic with molecular nitrogen and hence nitrosyl complexes may be suitable as models for co-ordinated nitrogen in the process of nitrogen fixation. In their own right nitrosyl complexes pose problems of chemical interest concerned with their structure and the bonding associated with the metal-nitrosyl bond. As part of an investigation into the geometry of co-ordinated nitrosyl this thesis presents structural data for several nitrosyl complexes of Group VIII metals .. In addition the mode of binding of the isocyanide group has been studied as well as the associated stereochemistry of the metals ruthenium, osmium and iridium. To date, structural studies have established three different modes of co-ordination for the nitrosyl group. Probably the most common involves a linear arrangement of metal, nitrogen and oxygen, the effective coordinating species being regarded as the diamagnetic nitrosonium ion (NO+).</field><field name="date">1972</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2122</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cytokinins and The Growth of Spirodela Oligorrhiza</field><field name="creator">McCombs, Patrick James Alan, 1947-</field><field name="description">1.	Spirodela oligorrhiza on sterile glucose-mineral medium ceased to grow three days after transfer into darkness. 2.	Cytokinins, supplied in the medium, allowed continuous growth of Spirodela after transfer into darkness. Other plant growth substances, or adenine analogues, were ineffective. 3.	Kinetin stimulated production of new fronds after a 24 hour lag period when added to dormant cultures although it was rapidly taken up. Kinetin reached a constant concentration in the plantlets within 30 to 60 minutes of addition to the medium. 4.	In the absence of cytokinin, dormancy continued for three or four weeks after which growth spontaneously resumed in darkness. The growth rate then reached almost half that achieved with optimum kinetin concentrations in darkness. Growth continued in darkness for at least eight weeks without cytokinin. 5.	Pretreatment in the light with either metabolic inhibitors, kinetin, abscisic acid, or high or low temperature, essentially eliminated the period of dormancy of Spirodela transferred to darkness in the absence of cytokinin. Growth was reduced 50% to 90% during the pretreatments. 6.	The pretreatments designed to affect plastid RNA, protein or ATP production were the most effective. The fastest growth rate achieved in darkness without cytokinin after pre-treatment was 10% less than that promoted by optimum kinetin. 7.	Dormant Spirodela in darkness continued to incorporate precursors into RNA, DNA and protein at a rate 50% that in growing (plus kinetin) cultures. Net rates of macromolecule accumulation were extremely slow, indicating extensive degradation. 8.	Addition of kinetine to non-growing Spirodela in darkness stimulated the synthesis of RNA, DNA and protein simultaneously after a lag of approximately one hour. The rates of precursor incorporation increased to equal those in continuously growing cultures. 9.	Non-growing Spriodela in darkness rapidly accumulated starch. Kinetin had little or no effect on accumulation and mobilisation of starch. 10.	14C-glucose was taken up by growing (plus kinetin) and non-growing (minus kinetin) Spirodela in darkness, and was metabolized equally in each. Three times as much 14C-glucose entered starch in the non-growing cultures. 11.	A model scheme for control of dormancy in Spirodela is proposed based on an inhibitory mediator. The mediator may be similar to the hypothetical mediator of the pleiotypic response shown by animal cells.</field><field name="date">1971</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270300 Microbiology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2123</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies on the respiration of mangrove seedlings</field><field name="creator">Outred, Heather Anne</field><field name="description">The mangrove seedlings Bruguiera and Aviceania develop in a swamp environment where oxygen may be deficient and carbon dioxide in high concentration. Both of these states may be inimical to respiratory processes in plants and especially to the early stages of germination. While vivipary allows the development of the seedlings to a stage where they may better withstand the unfavourable conditions of the environment, nevertheless mangrove seedlings are still liberated when low oxygen concentrations can have severe effects. The developing Avicennia seedling, while on the parent tree, is surrounded by a tough pericarp which restricts gaseous diffusion and induces a partially anaerobic environment around the cotyledon tissues. The detection of high lactic acid levels in Avicennia seedlings may be linked with the carbon dioxide-rich atmospheres which build up around the tissues. It is possible that high levels of carbon dioxide induce the production of lactic acid, a non-toxic product of fermentation, rather than of the more toxic ethanol. Lactic acid is also formed during the initial stages of anaerobiosis in Bruguiera seedlings.</field><field name="date">1973</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270400 Botany::270402 Plant physiology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2124</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Stratigraphy and sedimentology of the Te Kuiti group in Waitomo County, South Auckland</field><field name="creator">Nelson, Campbell S. (Campbell Symes)</field><field name="description">The Oligocene Te Kuiti Group in Waitomo County, North Island, New Zealand, is divided into two subgroups, six formations and seven limestone members; six of the members are new. The stratigraphic definition, distribution, thickness, lithology and contacts of major rock units, and the three dimensional relationships between them, are described and figured in detail. Rapid lateral and vertical lithologic variation in strata is accomodated by recognition of 31 lithofacies. Te Kuiti sediments, which include mainly bioclastic lutites, bioclastic arenites and biocalcarenites, were deposited in sublittoral waters, from a few to about 100 metres depth, as seas transgressed south over a topoqraphically subdued, but locally varied landscape cut in Mesozoic lutites and arenites. Distribution of major paleotectonic elements indicates the gross sedimentary environment was one of a north-facing, partly enclosed basin with a prominent north-trending median basement ridge (Piopio High) in the south. Deposition continued until this ridge was almost completely buried, at which time the Te Kuiti embayment expanded rapidly and linked with more southerly basins. The contact with the overlying Mahoenui Group is generally conformable in Waitomo County. Formations and members are commonly bounded by unconformities, mainly disconformities, some of which preserve features consistent with their interpretation as submarine hardgrounds. The unconformities record periods of erosion or non-deposition during major downward shifts in base level controlled partly by eustatic sea level changes. Comprehensive paleontological charts are prepared for each formation and age relationships established. Macrofossils are generally scarce, and dominated by thick-shelled, epifaunal bivalves. Foraminifera are more abundant and are mainly benthonic forms. Formations may straddle New Zealand stage boundaries and, within Waitomo County, are not strongly diachronous. Primary sedimentary structures in arenites and calcarenites include mainly thinly bedded wavy-, lenticular-, and cross-stratification formed by the spreading and interfering of sand sheets, sand ribbons and sand waves across extensive areas of flat shallow sea floor, possibly under the influence of tidal currents. Lutites and muddy arenites are massive and bioturbated. A new classification for mixed terrigenous-allochemical rocks is proposed and an X-ray technique developed for modal analyses of lutites. The petrography of individual lithofacies is described and illustrated in detail and summarised on pie diagrams. Variations in the kind, quantity, size, sorting and abrasion of bioclasts, in the king and quantity of matrix add/or cement, and in the content of glauconite and terrigenous sand and mud serve to distinguish the various lithofacies. Bioclasts are derived principally from bryozoans, echinoids and benthonic foraminifers and, to a lesser extent, from coralline algae, planktonic foraminifers, molluscs and brachiopods. Siliciclasts include mainly quartz, oligoclase &#8211; andesine plagioclase, potash feldspar, montmorillonitic clays and glauconite. Quartz and feldspar were detritally inherited from Mesozoic basement rocks; montmorillonite formed from the marine diagenetic transformation of vermiculite and degraded chlorite and illite derived from Oligocene soils; glauconite developed from mont-morillonitic clays under specific environmental conditions. Complete chemical analyses of seven glauconite concentrates are presented and compared with published analyses. The principal non-opaque heavy minerals in the group are zircon, epidote and apatite. Sediment pores are infilled with granular and rim ortho-sparite cement, or by a variety of matrix materials, including micrite, calcilutite and lutite. Petrologs display the vertical variation in petrographic properties through the group and, in conjunction with grain size analyses of insoluble residues, are used to interpret the energy level of the environment of deposition of individual rock units. Te Kuiti sediments accumulated under a spectrum of environmental energy conditions, ranging from quiet to strongly agitated waters. The primary Te Kuiti sediment was dominated by metastable magnesium calcite and, less abundant, aragonite skeletons. These skeletons underwent syndiagenetic stablisation reactions at, or close below, the sea floor. Large quantities of skeletal aragonite were dissolved from the sediment before lithification. Aragonite was preserved only where anaerobic conditions were maintained in the sediment. Stabilisation of magnesium calcite grains involved the texturally non-destructive process of incongruent dissolution, which yielded a replacement product of calcite. Sources of CaCO3 for cement included (a) solution of aragonite grains, (b) intergranular solution of bioclasts and, most important, (c) pervasive solution of bioclasts, under shallow burial loads, at those levels in the sediment relatively enrichment in siliciclastic, and especially muddy, material. Dissolved CaCO3 was precipitated as calcite cement in adjacent or nearby sediment layers. A paragenetic sequence of diagenetic events is established for the group. Finally, Oligocene paleogeography and paleoclimate are outlined and a synthesis of the environment of formation and depositional history of sediments of the Te Kuiti Group in Waitomo Country is established.</field><field name="date">1973</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::260000 Earth Sciences::260100 Geology::260111 Other stratigraphy (incl. sequence stratigraphy)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2126</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Aspects of the biology and utilisation of Pterocladia and Gracilaria</field><field name="creator">Luxton, David Morley</field><field name="description">Pterocladia lucida (R. Br.) J. Ag. is the prinipal raw material for agar production in New Zealand. Since collection commenced in 1943 the annual harvest has never stabilised and over recent years there has been a general decline, which has inhibited expansion of the indigenous industry. Field and laboratory studies have been made in order to obtain information on the biology of P. lucida. Form variability is considered in detail and a relationship between external morphology and wave exposure of the habitat is proposed. The culture of P. lucida from spores in a running seawater system is described in detail. Results on carpospore and tetraspore germination, and sporeling growth under light and temperature regimes are presented. Germination of both spore types was inhibited at 10&#176;C while at higher temperatures germination was greatest under 4 klux. Spore germination and sporeling development in culture is described. Only sterile prostrate thalli possessing rhizoidal haptera were obtained and a hypothesis relating the appearance of surface haptera to the direction of irradiation is proposed. The development of an outdoor wave tank for culturing is described and the growth rate and development of sporelings is discussed with reference to water movement. Sporelings were maintained in culture for up to 22 months. Cultured sporelings have also been transplanted into different habitats. Creeping axes established from carpospores produced erect fronds, which produced tetraspores after seven to ten months in situ. This confirmed part of a Polysiphonia-type life history for the first time in a Gelidioid species. Axis elongation rate in situ was estimated to be less than 10cm year-1 at Leigh. It was concluded that the collection of attached weed could not be sustained annually, but controlled harvesting in specific areas every two years is advocated. Seasonal variation in agar yield and gel strength from wave exposed and sheltered populations of P. lucida was studied. Agar levels varied throughout the year, being greatest in spring and summer, while gel strengths showed a similar trend. The feasibility of utilising indigenous Gracilaria secundata Harvey forma pseudoflagellifera May has been studied. The yield and gel properties of agar were determined from different alkali pretreatments. There was a marked increase in gel strength when weed was pretreated in alkali, the maximum gel strength being obtained from a weed treatment of 3 percent NaOH for three hours at 80&#176;C. The gel properties of agar from G. secundata f. pseudoflagellifera are compared with agar from other sources. The agar was suitable for commercial use, but exhibited a greater resilience than that from Pterocladia lucida. The vegetative regeneration of G. secundata f. pseudoflagellifera in the Manukau Harbour has been studied and an experimental harvest of 0.68t is described. During spring 100 percent regeneration from hand cleared and raked areas occurred after eight to thirteen weeks. Based on regeneration results, mechanical harvesting four times a year of Gracilaria mats in the Manukau Harbour is advocated. The predicted sustainable yield is 1084-1304t year-1. The extraction and gel properties of agar from Melanthalia abscissa (Turn.) Hook. et Harv. are reported for the-first time, but the commercial collection of this species is not advocated.</field><field name="date">1977</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270400 Botany::270499 Botany not elsewhere classified</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2128</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Temporal mach bands: a psychophysical study</field><field name="creator">Kirkwood, B. J.</field><field name="description">Five experiments were carried out to discover whether there is a subjective enhancement of temporal contours analogous to the Mach band effects in spatial vision. A transient overshoot in the incremental threshold occurred immediately after the crest of rising linear ramps at photopic levels. A psychophysical matching experiment verified that this peaking effect is perceived as a bright pulse and can be considered the temporal equivalent of the bright Mach band. No equivalent of the dark Mach band at the foot of rising linear ramps was found. Rather there was an anticipatory decrease of sensitivity (Crawford effect) at the base of ascending gradients. The magnitude of this effect was directly proportional to the rate of change of the stimulus at photopic levels. Data from descending ramps was less simple to interpret. A small rise in incremental threshold was sometimes observed at the crest of ramps, but this effect was much less pronounced than the peak at the crest of equivalent ascending ramps. Matching procedures located troughs at the foot of descending ramps which correspond to the dark spatial Mach band. This effect was less apparent when incremental threshold techniques were employed. An experiment using exponential rather than linear change in luminance over time gave results in general accord with the above. The Crawford effect was found to follow the Bunsen-Roscoe Law. It was found that the transient undershoot and overshoot effects were related to the rate of change rather than the actual form of the ramp when the rate of change was greater than about 300mL per second. Impulse responses were derived by differentiating step responses. Ascending steps generated a biphasic impulse response and descending steps give a triphasic unit impulse response. This lack of equivalence over conditions is diagnostic of system nonlinearity. Fourier analysis of the impulse responses showed equivalent spectral components and lowpass filter action in each case, indicating change in gain and phasing rather than time constants occur between 'on' and 'off' conditions. The system was shown to be quasilinear within conditions since linear convolution of the impulse responses with appropriate ramps generated functions that were a fair approximation to the psychophysical response to such ramps. The relationship between the impulse response and the spatial equivalent line spread function was discussed and the similarity of the impulse responses to dynamic changes in sensitivity inferred from results of masking experiments pointed out. The results were then considered in relation to a multichannel model for processing spatiotemporal information.</field><field name="date">1979</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology::380103 Biological psychology (neuropsychology, psychopharmacology, physiological psychology)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2129</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Intelligent motion control with an artificial cerebellum</field><field name="creator">Smith, Russell L.</field><field name="description">This thesis describes a novel approach for adaptive optimal control and demonstrates its application to a variety of systems, including motion control learning for legged robots. The new controller, called &#8220;FOX&#8221;, uses a modified form of Albus&#8217;s CMAC neural network. It is trained to generate control signals that minimize a system&#8217;s performance error. A theoretical consideration of the adaptive control problem is used to show that FOX must assign each CMAC weight an &#8220;eligibility&#8221; value which controls how that weight is updated. FOX thus implements a kind of reinforcement learning which makes it functionally similar to the cerebellum (a part of the brain that modulates movement). A highly efficient implementation is described which makes FOX suitable for on-line control. FOX requires a small amount of dynamical information about the system being controlled: the system&#8217;s impulse response is used to choose the rules that update the eligibility values. A FOX-based controller design methodology is developed, and FOX is tested on four control problems: controlling a simulated linear system, controlling a model gantry crane, balancing an inverted pendulum on a cart, and making a wheeled robot follow a path. In each case FOX is effective: it associates sensor values with (and anticipates) the correct control actions, it compensates for system nonlinearities, and it provides robust control as long as the training is comprehensive enough. FOX is also applied to the control of a simulated hopping monoped, and a walking biped. FOX learns parameters that fine tune the movements of pre-programmed controllers, in a manner analogous to the cerebellar modulation of spinal cord reflexes in human movement. The robots are successfully taught how to move with a steady gait along flat ground, in any direction, and how to climb and descend slopes.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290900 Electrical and Electronic Engineering::290901 Electrical engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2130</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Economic Governance for a Globalising Auckland? Political Projects, Institutions and Policy</field><field name="creator">Wetzstein, Steffen</field><field name="description">In the context of a peripheral, small and largely resource-based economy, New Zealand&#8217;s economic policy makers have for long faced the key challenge of influencing global connections of local actors in value-adding activities. This dissertation seeks to interpret the nature and trajectories of governance activities relating to economic processes in Auckland, New Zealand&#8217;s largest city-region, in the 1990&#8217;s and 2000&#8217;s. This period, a time of neoliberalising political-economic conditions following intensive economic restructuring in the 1980s, saw a re-entry of central government to the governing landscape of Auckland. The research focuses on how regional actors such as the Auckland Regional Growth Forum, the Auckland Regional Economic Development Strategy and the business-driven initiatives of &#8216;Competitive Auckland&#8217;, &#8216;Committee for Auckland&#8217; and the &#8216;Knowledge Wave&#8217; conferences, gradually became aligned with an emerging governmental project from central government that re-defined perceptions of and expectations about Auckland&#8217;s economic role. The research approach is informed by several literatures, especially those of the regulation, actor-network and governmentality schools. The different questions that spring from these literatures enable scrutiny of Auckland&#8217;s institutional developments in terms of the identification of interdependencies amongst governing interests, the nature and degree of mediation of investment processes from institutional experimentation and the possible emergence of effects from new governance arrangements. The thesis situates and uses the policy and academic positioning of the researcher to develop methodologies to interrogate the emergence of the material and discursive dimensions of the regional economic governance framework of Auckland. This thesis argues that ongoing institutional experimentation has been both a pre-cursor to and an active ingredient in the re-appearance of the New Zealand central state in Auckland&#8217;s economic governance. Importantly, governing is increasingly complex; and about mobilising a range of actors by influencing their perceptions about governing and investment goals through discursive governance practices. In this context, current socio-economic interventions can be best understood as contingent assemblages of governing resources, producing discursive alignments of interests that lead to a re-working of processes and practices of the state-regulatory apparatus. The effects of the institutional developments on private investment decisions are largely unknown however. While the emerging institutional framework for economic governance involving Auckland is increasingly embracing Auckland&#8217;s globalising character, influencing the city-region&#8217;s economic participation in the globalising world economy may be harder to achieve as a political project than current policy rhetoric implies. Theoretically, this research challenges territorial conceptualisations of political economic management and contributes to the wider development of a relational-institutional framework for understanding sub-national economic governance.

One is Portuguese, Violante del Cielo, and four are Spaniards: Luisa de Carvajal y Mendoza, Leonor de la Cueva y Silva, Marcia Belisarda and Catalina Clara Ram&#237;rez de Guzm&#225;n. All are from the educated upper or noble classes and their lives span some one hundred and forty years, from 1566 to 1693. The thesis focuses particularly on their sonnets of love and friendship, both secular and religious. The sonnet was specifically chosen as the vehicle to study the ideas and concerns of literate, seventeenth-century women. As a difficult form of poetry requiring wit, artistry and education, sonnets enable a display of intellectual capabilities and offer opportunities for veiled criticism of contemporary systems of control. These women do not overtly rail against a system that offers them much in terms of social advancement and privilege. However, they do re-write our understanding of the Baroque by presenting their interests, pleasures and discontents from a feminine viewpoint. This detailed, contextual study of women's works, set against the philosophical, religious and moral treatises that governed their age, enables a wider interpretation of women's thought and intentions in the Iberian peninsula than may hitherto have been acknowledged, particularly in terms of relationships of affection within the family. Collectively, their individual works display a determination to demonstrate women's intelligence and moral strength. Furthermore, it becomes clear that women living within a system that utilised biological determinism as proof that they were incapable of reason, strive in their works to show that they are both capable of reason and determined to demonstrate it as undeniable fact.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420300 Cultural Studies::420399 Cultural studies not elsewhere classified</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2132</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modelling cardiac activation from cell to body surface</field><field name="creator">Buist, Martin L.</field><field name="description">In this thesis, the forward problem of electrocardiography is investigated from a cellular level through to potentials on the surface of the torso. This integrated modelling framework is based on three spatial scales. At the smallest spatial resolution, several cardiac cellular models are implemented that are used to represent the underlying cellular electrophysiology. A bidomain framework is used to couple multiple individual cells together and this provides a mathematical model of the myocardial tissue. The cardiac geometry is described using finite elements with high order cubic Hermite basis function interpolation. An anatomically based description of the fibrous laminar cardiac microstructure is then defined relative to the geometric mesh. Within the local element space of the cardiac finite elements, a fine collocation mesh is created on which the bidomain equations are solved. Each collocation point represents a continuum cell and contains a cellular model to describe the local active processes. This bidomain implementation works in multiple coordinate systems and over deforming domains, in addition to having the ability to spatially vary any parameter throughout the myocardium. On the largest spatial scale the passive torso regions surrounding the myocardium are modelled using a generalised Laplace equation to describe the potential field and current flows. The torso regions are discretised using either finite elements or boundary elements depending on the electrical properties of each region. The cardiac region is coupled to the surrounding torso through several methods. A traditional dipole source approach is implemented that creates equivalent cardiac sources through the summation of cellular dipoles. These dipoles are then placed within a homogeneous cardiac region and the resulting potential field is calculated throughout the torso. Two new coupling techniques are developed that provide a more direct path from cellular activation to body surface potentials. One approach assembles all of the equations from the passive torso regions and the equations from the extracellular bidomain region into a single matrix system. Coupling conditions based on the continuity of potential and current flow across the myocardial surfaces are used to couple the regions and therefore solving the matrix system yields a solution that is continuous across all of the solution points within the torso. The second approach breaks the large system into smaller subproblems and the continuity conditions are iii iv imposed through an iterative approach. Across each of the myocardial surfaces, a fixed point iteration is set up with the goal of converging towards zero potential and current flow differences between adjacent regions. All of the numerical methods used within the integrated modelling framework are rigorously tested individually before extensive tests are performed on the coupling techniques. Large scale simulations are run to test the dipole source approach against the new coupling techniques. Several sets of simulations are run to investigate the effects of using different ionic current models, using different bidomain model simplifications, and the role that the torso inhomogeneities play in generating body surface potentials. The main question to be answered by this study is whether or not the traditional approach of combining a monodomain heart with an equivalent cardiac source in a two step approach is adequate when generating body surface potentials. Comparisons between the fully coupled framework developed here and several dipole based approaches demonstrate that the resulting sets of signals have different magnitudes and different waveform shapes on both the torso and epicardial surface, clearly illustrating the inadequacy of the equivalent cardiac source models. It has been found that altering the modelling assumptions on each spatial scale produces noticeable effects. At the smallest scale, the use of different cell models leads to significantly different body surface potential traces. At the next scale the monodomain approach is unable to accurately reproduce the results from a full bidomain framework, and at the largest level the inclusion of different torso inhomogeneities has a large effect on the magnitude of the torso and epicardial potentials. Adding a pair of lungs to the torso model changes the epicardial potentials by an average of 16% which is consistent with the experimental range of between 8 and 20%. This provides evidence that only a complex, coupled, biophysically based model will be able to properly reproduce clinical ECGs.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::291500 Biomedical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2133</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Some aspects of the microbiological activity of the Mangere oxidation ponds</field><field name="creator">Brockett, Olive Dinah.</field><field name="description">1.	A general introduction to the theory, operation and biological activity of oxidation ponds has been given as well as specific introductions to the two areas of research studied, namely the role of fungi and some aspects of the nitrogen cycle in the Mangere oxidation ponds. 2.	The enumeration and identification of fungi present in the bottom layers of the pond showed that the numbers were not sufficiently large to make a valuable contribution to the degradation of organic material in that particular environment. The dominant fungi present were species of the genera Penicillium, Mucor, Trichoderma and Geotrichum. 3.	Isolates of some of the fungi most frequently isolated from these lower regions were grown under conditions of low redox potential. It was found that although the fungi did grow over the one month test period, they did not show great metabolic activity. 4.	Direct examination of pond water containing a whitish glassy scum showed only the presence of clumps of heterogenous biomass but no dominant microorganism. Filamentous yeasts isolated from these scum samples formed a surface layer when grown in liquid medium. When inoculated into pond water it appeared that these filamentous yeasts formed a matrix to which the biomass adhered producing a condition similar to that seen in the original samples. 5.	Use of ultra think layers of cetyl alcohol prevented scum formation by these filamentous yeasts but not growth in the medium underneath. Larger scale trials would be required to determine if this method is feasible for reducing scum formation in oxidation ponds. 6.	Investigation of the proteolytic activity of pond sludge showed that the part of the nitrogen cycle which concerns the degradation of protein was present and active in the oxidation ponds. Proteolytic activity was found to increase with increasing depth of pond water up to the maximum (220 cm) tested. This suggests that increasing the depth of the ponds to approximately 185 cm (6 ft.) would improve pond efficiency in relation to degradation of protein. 7.	The bacteria responsible for nitrification in the oxidation pond surface water were isolated and identified. Nitrosomonas was responsible for the oxidation of ammonia to nitrite and Nitrobacter for the oxidation of nitrite to nitrate. A twelve month survey of these bacteria showed Nitrite accumulated only when large numbers of Nitrosomonas were present. Statistical analysis of the data obtained indicated that populations of these bacteria were influenced by pH, alkalinity and ammonia. 8.	Enumeration of denitrifying bacteria at different pond depths showed that greatest numbers were present in the sludge and interface although they were well distributed through the aqueous phase. 9.	Identification of the isolated denitrifying bacteria showed that they were strains of Pseudomonas denitrificans, Micrococcus denitrificans and Bacillus lichenformis. Their identity was confirmed by comparison with standard cultures. 10.	The denitrifying properties of these bacteria were studied to compare their ability to remove nitrate, as well as their reaction to additives. All three bacteria were able to remove low levels of nitrate but high nitrate concentrations were shown to be inhibitory. The use of additives to promote denitrification appeared to depend on the additive and the bacterium and not on the carbon nitrogen ration. Of the materials tested glucose was the most satisfactory and methanol the most inhibitory. Further work is necessary to clarify the role of methanol because in small scale studies with sewage effluents in other laboratories it has been found to be most efficient in promoting denitrification. 11.	Continous measurements of the redox potential interface of a sludge, and pond top liquid (10-15cm. from the surface) revealed that the electronegative potential of the sludge remained remarkably steady. When the electrode was at either the interface or near the surface it recorded a distinct diurnal pattern. In pond top liquid the length of the positive potential period was dependent on day length. A change from the normal redox potential pattern of pond top liquid preceded deterioration of pond stability. The pattern returned to normal after a change in environmental conditions. It appears that continuous redox potential measurements could be valuable in showing changes in pond performance before they can be detected by other methods.</field><field name="date">1971</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270400 Botany</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2134</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The middle Jurassic of New Zealand : a study of the lithostratigraphy and biostratigraphy of the Ururoan, Temaikan and Lower Heterian Stages (?Pliensbachian to ?Kimmeridgian)</field><field name="creator">Hudson, Neville</field><field name="description">The lithologic and biostratigraphic successions of Ururoan, Temaikan and Lower - Middle Heterian (?Sinemurian, Pliensbachian - ?Kimmeridgian) strata from southwest Auckland, south Otago and Southland, New Zealand, are described and discussed. A more logical correlation of the lithologic sequence at Port Waikato with that at Te Akau is proposed. Two new formations are introduced for the sequences on the western limb of the Kawhia Regional Syncline, the Whakapatiki Mudstone for the fine grained lower Kirikiri Group strata in the Awakino Valley and the Gribbon Formation for the Rengarenga Group strata between Marokopa and Mahoenui. In Southland a new formation (Ben Bolt Formation) is proposed for the c.1340m sequence overlying the Flag Hill Sandstone, in turn overlain by a 485m thick, mudstone-dominated formation for which a long disused name is resurrected (Lora Formation). The Lora Formation is in turn overlain by a coarse-grained unit, for which the name West Peak Formation is proposed. In the absence of suitable alternatives, a subdivision of the Ururoan Stage into a Lower Ururoan, the range-zone of pseudaucella marshalli, and an Upper Ururoan, the interval-zone between the last appearance of Pseudaucella marshalli and the first appearance of a Temaikan fauna is proposed. The existing three-fold subdivision of the Temaikan Stage is emended. Belemnopsis mackayi and B. deborahae are retained as the indices of the Temaikan and its lowest subdivision, as they are present in most sections at a consistent stratigraphic position. Retroceramus (Fractoceramus) inconditus is proposed as the basal Middle Temaikan index species. Retroceramus(R.) brownei, which first appears consistently higher than R. inconditus, but below R. marwicki is proposed as the index for the upper Middle Temaikan. Retroceramus (R.) marwicki is proposed as a replacement upper Temaikan index for "Macrocephalites cf. beta-gamma" which is unsuitable. Meleagrinella n. sp. is inconsistent in its first appearance and therefore unsuitable as a Middle Temaikan index and, although confined to this stage, it ranges from Early to early Upper Temaikan. Basal Temaikan Belemnopsis spp. are absent from sections in the Catlins district whereas the earliest Temaikan taxon appearing above typical Ururoan faunas is Meleagrinella n. sp. In the absence of a better alternative Meleagrinella n. sp. is used to mark the base of the stage in the Catlins sections. However, the base of the Temaikan is here likely to be slightly younger than in other sections. Within the redefined Upper Temaikan four subdivisions based on the sequence of Retroceramus species are recognised. The lowest of these is characterised by the first appearance of R. (R.) marwicki, the second by the first appearance of R. (R.) n. sp. A., the third characterised by the first appearance of R. (R.) stehni, and the highest marked by the first appearance of either R. (R ) sp. C. (a wide triangular form) or sp. D. (an ovate flat form). The presence of these two morphologic forms indicate finer zonation of the Upper Temaikan may be possible, with further field work. The Ururoan to Middle Heterian succession of New Zealand is correlated with the international chronostratigraphic scheme based mainly on comparison of New Zealand's Retroceramus succession with that of South America and Indonesia and on relatively rare ammonites. The Ururoan is equivalent to the ?Sinemurian to Late Toarcian, Temaikan to the ?latest Toarcian to Early Callovian and the Early Heterian to the Middle Callovian to latest Middle to Late Oxfordian. Early Ururoan is correlated with the ?Sinemurian to Pliensbachian based on the presence of the ammonite Juraphyllites. Presence of the Early Toarican ammonites Harpoceras cf. falcifer and Dactylioceras spp. in the Late Ururoan indicates a potential international correlation of ?Late Pliensbachian to Late Toarcian. A ?late Toarcian to Aalenian correlation for the Early Temaikan is suggested by the presence of the European belemnite Brevibelus zieteni. Retroceramus (Fractoceramus) inconditus is similar to the Northern hemisphere Mytiloceramus lucifer and the northern hemisphere Retroceramus gr. popovi and thus suggests a latest Aalenian to Early Bajocian correlation of the Middle Temaikan. The earliest Late Middle Temaikan Retroceramus (Retroceramus) marwicki is also present in the Late Bajocian (Rotundum Zone) of Argentina. ?Teloceras gr. banksi, ?stephanoceras (S.) gr. humphriesianum, Chondroceras (C.) gr. evolvescens, C. (C.) cf. recticostatum, and C. (Defonticeras) cf. oblatum are present in the Middle Temaikan reinforcing an earliest to late Early Bajocian correlation for this substage. Toxamblyites aff. densicostatus Sturani, Chondroceras (C.) gr. Evolvescens (Waagen), C. (Schmidtoceras) orbignyanum (Wright), C. (Defonticeras?) sp. indet. occur with Retroceramus marwicki indicating an Early to Late Bajocian correlation for this zone, slightly broader than in Argentina. However, somewhat anomalously the first of these ammonites suggests a Mid Aalenian to Early Bajocian correlation. The succeeding zone (Retroceramus (R.) n. sp A. zone) has yielded the Latest Bathonian Xenocephalites grantmackiei and Lilloettia aff. boesei. Retroceramus(R.)stehni is the index for the third Upper Temaikan Retroceramus zone and is also known from the latest Bathonian to Early Callovian of Argentina. In New Zealand R. stehni is associated with Lilloettia cf. Lilloetensis and Xenocephalites cf. stipanicici which also indicate a latest Bathonian to Early Callovian correlation. The fourth and highest zone of the Upper Temaikan has yielded the ammonites Araucanites marwicki, Eurycephalites gr. extremus, Iniskinites gr. cepoides and Choffatia (Homoeoplanulites) sp. suggesting an Early to Middle Callovian correlation. The overseas relationships of the associated Retroceramus (R.) spp. C. and D. are unknown. The Heterian index Retroceramus (Retroceramus) galoi is of Oxfordian age in Indonesia where it is associated with Malayomaorica malayomaorica. In New Zealand Araucanites marwicki and Sulaites heteriense are present in the Early Heterian, below the incoming of Malayomaorica malayomaorica, low in the range of Retroceramus galoi. The presence of Sulaites high in the Early Heterian suggests a ?Middle to Late Oxfordian correlation while Araucanites indicates the lowest part of the range of Retroceramus galoi could be slightly older, perhaps Upper Callovian. The biostratigraphic scheme presented here is a significant advance on those proposed previously.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::260000 Earth Sciences::260100 Geology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2135</field></doc><doc><field name="title">&#8221;My Two Countries Firmly Under My Feet&#8221;: Explorations of Multicultural Identity in the Fiction of Amelia Batistich and Yvonne du Fresne</field><field name="creator">Nola, Nina</field><field name="description">This thesis offers a detailed reading of the fiction of the Dalmatian New Zealand author Amelia Batistich and the Danish New Zealand author Yvonne du Fresne from the perspective of multicultural literary criticism. It draws strongly throughout on interviews and discussions with the authors themselves, and on their personal papers. The Introduction explores the term "multicultural literary criticism", examines its significant development in theory and practice in Australia (especially in the writings of Sneja Gunew), and discusses the challenging issues raised by its use in a bicultural context, in New Zealand. The body of the thesis is organised into two parallel sections, the first (of five chapters) on Batistich and the second (of four chapters) on du Fresne. Each section begins with an introduction to the writing life of the author concerned, with particular reference to the forces. Shaping her sense of identity as a New Zealander from an ethnic minority community. Subsequent chapters then discuss chronologically the development of the author&#8217;s work from short fiction and articles through to the later novels. Each author's struggle to find a fictional voice which expressed her identity as a hybrid New Zealander is highlighted. The role of editors and publishers in shaping the migrant voice of both authors is also explored, and the reception of both authors' works by critics often unwilling or unable to read for difference in a literary landscape dominated by the perception of New Zealand as socially homogeneous. The thesis argues - in an extended enquiry into the constructedness of identity - that both authors have struggled throughout their careers to find a place for both themselves and their characters in New Zealand literature. The bibliography contains a checklist of the published writings of both authors, primary and secondary material related to the field of ethnic minority writing, and a checklist of other migrant writings and creative multicultural works in New Zealand. &#8220;No matter how far fate has blown the frail tree of my life across foreign lands, its roots have always sucked nourishment from that little barren clod of soil from which it sprung."

Murray (Kenneth Murray)</field><field name="description">The reactions between tritium gas and organic substrates sorbed on irradiated silica gel have been studied. It has been found that tritium gas, when admitted to gamma-irradiated silica gel, is adsorbed on radiation-induced sites on the solid and bleaches the blue colour of the solid. The sorbed tritium becomes activated to at least two forms; one capable of exchange with alkanes such as 2 methylbutane and both capable of exchange with toluene and 2 chloro2methylbutane. High levels of tritium were incorporated into 2 methylbutane, 2 chloro2methylbutane and toluene, up to 32&#177;2%, 95% and 100% of the total tritium present, respectively, being incorporated (using 2 g SiO2, irradiated 15h), with high standards of radiochemical purity, (97&#177;1% for 2 methylbutane). Yields of labelled hydrocarbons were found to be sensitive to the conditions under which the silica gel was degassed before irradiation; optimum degassing conditions being evacuation for one hour at 973 K. Yields were also found to be dependent on the quantities of silica gel and tritium used and on the radiation dose given the silica gel, all three of these being increased concurrently for maxim yields to be obtained. In a study of the labelling of hydrocarbons of different structures it was found that alkanes containing a tertiary carbon atom were labeled heavily compared to straight-chain hydrocarbons; activity yields of the substrate hydrocarbon decreasing with increasing molecular size, to insignificant values with hydrocarbons heavier than 2 methylhexane. Unsaturated hydrocarbons such as hex-1-ene were found to undergo hydrogenation on irradiated silica gel to produce labelled alkanes; branched-chain alkenes undergoing double-bond isomerization. Reaction mechanisms for tritium activation and exchange have been proposed, involving ionization of tritium by radiation-induced positive holes in the solid and exchange of the ionic species with carbonium ion intermediates. It has also been established that gamma-irradiated alkali halides do not promote exchange of tritium gas with alkanes.</field><field name="date">1973</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2138</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Processes in the decomposition of network of queues</field><field name="creator">McNickle, Donald Christopher.</field><field name="description">There are two possible approaches to the problem of a network of service facilities, where an individual customer passes through the network, queueing for service at some or all of these facilities. Either we produce methods by which the network may be decomposed into small manageable parts, or we must attempt to solve simultaneously for all the properties of the network, at a particular time. At present, the class of networks for which comprehensive solutions are known is so restricted that it is usually essential to consider the first approach, at least in the first instance. First we consider the problem of decomposition points, the points at which a stream of customers is broken up into several substreams, heading for different destinations. Conditions are established for a class of decomposition switches, which ensure that if the input stream to the switch is a Markov renewal process, then so are each of the substreams. We then investigate the behaviour of one of these substreams at a subsequent service facility. When the service times are exponentially distributed, an analysis of this, the SM/M/1 queue, based on the properties of the busy cycle, considerably simplifies and extends the results known for it. Some attempt is made to relax the condition on the service time distribution. Since there is always the possibility that a Poisson process approximation to the arrival stream may be acceptable, the dual of this queue, where the sequence of service times forms a Markov renewal process, is considered. This seems a particularly appropriate generalisation, since it allows for different classes of service requirements, perhaps reflecting the origin of customers from various parts of the network. In addition, some results are presented for a queue in which both the arrival times and service requirements depend on the sequence of customer types. Since the output from a queue in a network will form part or all of the input to a subsequent queue, we consider, finally, the departure processes from queues of the types that have been mentioned. Although, in general, it is not possible to describe the departure stream from queues of these types in terms of a particular stochastic process, we can find the distributions of some of the parameters of a very general departure process, in particular, the number of departures from the last queue mentioned above.</field><field name="date">1974</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::310000 Architecture, Urban Environment and Building</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2139</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Hyperbolic Geometry and Reflection Groups</field><field name="creator">Marshall, T.

The cases k=l, n+1 give, respectively a pair of hyperboloids, and the ordinary n-sphere. In the first chapter we consider the pseudospheres as surfaces h En+1,k, where Em,k=Rk x (iR)m-k, and investigate their geometry in terms of the linear algebra of these spaces. The main objects of investigation are finite sequences of hyperplanes in a pseudosphere. To each such sequence we associate a square symmetric matrix, the Gram matrix, which gives information about angle and incidence properties of the hyperplanes. We find when a given matrix is the Gram matrix of some sequence of hyperplanes, and when a sequence is determined up to isometry by its Gram matrix. We also consider subspaces of pseudospheres and projections onto them. This leads to an n-dimensional cosine rule for spherical and hyperbolic simplices. In the second chapter we derive integral formulae for the volume of an n-dimensional spherical or hyperbolic simplex, both in terms of its dihedral angles and its edge lengths. For the regular simplex with common edge length &#947; we then derive power series for the volume, both in u = sin&#947;/2, and in &#947; itself, and discuss some of the properties of the coefficients. In obtaining these series we encounter an interesting family of entire functions, Rn(p) (n a nonnegative integer and p&#949;C). We derive a functional equation relating Rn(p) and Rn-1(p). Finally we classify, up to isometry, all tetrahedra with one or more vertices truncated, for which the dihedral angles along the edges formed by the truncatons. are all &#960;/2, and the remaining dihedral angles are all sub-multiples of &#960;. We show how to find the volumes of these polyhedra, and find presentations and small generating sets for the orientation-preserving subgroups of their reflection groups. For particular families of these groups, we find low index torsion free subgroups, and construct associated manifolds and manifolds with boundary In particular, we find a sequence of manifolds with totally geodesic boundary of genus, g&#8805;2, which we conjecture to be of least volume among such manifolds.</field><field name="date">1994</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::230000 Mathematical Sciences::230100 Mathematics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2140</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Remote sensing techniques for geothermal investigation and monitoring in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Mongillo, M. A. (Mike A.), 1949-</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the use of remote sensing techniques for the investigation and monitoring of geothermal areas in the Taupo volcanic zone of New Zealand. The research and development of a helicopter-borne video thermal infrared scanner technique and associated computer image processing methods constitutes the major portion of this study. In addition, preliminary results are presented from a related shallow ground temperature study conducted to investigate diurnal, seasonal and meteorological effects on temperatures in active thermal ground and results from a precursory assessment of SPOT-l satellite multispectral imagery obtained over the Waiotapu Geothermal Field for detecting, identifying and mapping characteristic geothermal surface features are also reported. The initial conduct of two video thermal IR scanner test surveys, one using an Inframetrics 525 over portions of the Rotorua Geothermal Field, the other using a FLIR 1000A over portions of the Wairakei-Tauhara Geothermal Field, demonstrated that imagery useful for basic geothermal feature mapping could be obtained in the late summer to early autumn period. Surveying during the hours around dusk was shown to be appropriate. Experimentation established instrument operating settings and defined nominal survey parameters. The real-time video imagery format proved useful as an aid to navigation and as a check on proper instrument set-up and operation- The helicopter platform provided valuable manoeuvrability and control. The results obtained from these two initial surveys aided development of survey design and conduct methodology. The video imagery obtained with both the Inframetrics and FLIR scanners was compatible with New Zealand's PAL standard- Visual TV-VCR inspection of the IR imagery allowed easy identification of a range of natural thermal features. Identification of cultural features aided location of the thermal anomalies. The Inframetrics imagery suffered from serious banding and other minor problems. The FLIR imagery was of a generally higher quality, though it exhibited problems. The fundamental ability to digitize images from the videotapes and apply powerful computer image processing techniques to aid interpretation and analysis was demonstrated. A methodology for pre-processing and enhancing the digitized Inframetrics and FLIR images was developed. Application of these image processing techniques brought out detail unavailable in the grey-level imagery and greatly increased interpretation ability. The demonstrated success of the first two test surveys led to the conduct of the first known large-scale video thermal IR scanner surveys of geothermal fields. Most details of the first of these ate confidential (at the client's request). A complete range of geothermal features was detected and easily recognised and their distribution established thus providing a much more detailed map of the geothermal activity than was previously available. The successful results attained confirmed the survey design and conduct methodology used. The second and largest survey covered the entire Rotorua Geothermal Field (l8 km2). Imagery was obtained with both the Inframetrics and FLIR IR scanners and a visible wavelength video camera. Extensive ground control measurements were made. This comprehensive survey of geothermal activity established a baseline from which change can be monitored The survey identified large scale seepage and submerged thermal input into Lake Rotorua which may be the source of known missing chloride. The first geothermal surface feature changes were identified, thus demonstrating the usefulness of the method for monitoring change. Preliminary image temperature calibration results were obtained and a procedure for constructing visible wavelength-thermal IR composite images was developed. The positive results demonstrated by this survey have led to the helicopter-borne video thermal IR technique being adopted for major geothermal feature mapping and monitoring programmes in New Zealand. Preliminary assessment of the high spatial resolution (20m) SPOT-1 multispectral imagery of the Waiotapu Geothermal Field. showed that the larger geothermal surface features can be detected and identified on a contrast stretched, 3-band colour composite image. A shallow (&#8804; 1m depth) ground temperature measurement site was established in an area extending from very active to near ambient conditions. Preliminary results show that temperature variations ranging from l-19 &#176;C can occur in the most active ground. These temperature variations exhibit a strong negative correlation with atmospheric prcss111e changes and can introduce large, unexpected inaccuracies in ground temperature measurements.</field><field name="date">1992</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::260000 Earth Sciences::269900 Other Earth Sciences::269901 Physical geography</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2141</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Numerical modelling of fibre-reinforced thermoplastic sheet forming</field><field name="creator">Christie, G. Richard</field><field name="description">Continuous Fibre Reinforced Thermoplastics (CFRTPs) combine high strength, stiffness, impact and chemical resistance with possibilities for efficient part production by various thermoforming processes. Sheet forming of molten CFRTP laminates has generated much interest, but problems of buckling, wrinkling and predicting fibre distribution have meant a deeper understanding of these processes is needed. The first part of this study looks at the problem of gross buckling in homogeneous &#8220;trellis&#8221; flows of bidirectional laminates. Modelling the molten composite as a Newtonian fluid reinforced by inextensible fibres, linear stability analysis is used to determine the growth rate of small out-of-plane imperfections. Buckling is predicted when fibre tensions are negative, indicating that laminates must be kept in tension during forming to reduce such defects. A new approach to Grid Strain Analysis is presented, which uses surface fitting to determine the deformations occurring in sheet forming. The new method improves analysis of smooth, inhomogeneous deformations, and allows greater flexibility in viewing the results. The technique has been used to visualise deformations in a blister fairing made from cross-ply PLYTRON laminates. Arrow diagrams produced from the part demonstrate the tendency of bidirectional composites to deform by trellis flow, while transverse flow results from the action of the diaphragms used to form the part. The significance of inter-ply slip in CFRTP sheet forming provided the impetus to develop a finite element model for molten laminates, which treats each ply as a separate continuum. Contact between plies is modelled, with slip given a viscous response. Ply deformations are governed by a highly anisotropic elastic law, to handle the stiff fibres and as a first step towards a viscoelastic model of major intra-ply deformation modes. The finite element model parameters were adjusted to fit the part shape and load response of unidirectional PLYTRON laminates in bending. However, a perfect fit is unobtainable due to local transverse flow occurring at the bend in the real laminate. Nevertheless, the bending of the remainder of the ply is well described by the elastic model, using a fibre direction stiffness 25000 times that in the transverse direction. With the present model, a somewhat less anisotropic set of parameters gives the best overall fit and has been applied in several thermoforming simulations. As observed in experiments, matched-die bending simulations display ply buckling at high forming speeds. Hemispherical dome forming simulations exhibit out-of-plane buckling and near-inextensible fibre behaviour, with trellis-like deformation predominant in cross-ply laminates. In simulated double-diaphragm forming of bends and hemispherical domes, tension superimposed on the laminate from the stretching diaphragms is shown to eliminate buckling. However, high forming pressures and excessive transverse flow are a problem with current, stiff diaphragms. Final discussions look at improving contact modelling, reducing model sizes by adopting thin shell assumptions, and improving the ply model.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290500 Mechanical and Industrial Engineering::290501 Mechanical engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2143</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Iodine azide addition to alkenes</field><field name="creator">Smith-Palmer, Truis</field><field name="description">Various systems for the formation of iodo-azide derivatives of alkenes have been examined. Iodine(I) azide, formed from sodium azide-iodine(I) chloride, has been found to exist in acetonitrile as a complex with sodium azide. The addition of iodine(I) azide to 5&#945;-androst-2-ene in both dichloromethane and acetonitrile has been examined in detail, as well as the addition of thallium(I) azide-iodine in dichloromethane to the same substrate. Products were identified as those arising by diaxial opening of either &#945;- or &#946;-iodonium ions, or by cis-addition to the &#945;-face of the alkene. Addition of iodine(I) azide in dichloromethane to 3-methyl-5&#945;-androst-2-ene gave a cis-adduct as the major product, in addition to trans-diaxial adducts and a trans-diequatorial adduct. Formation of the products was rationalised as arising from c-3 carbocations or from trans-diaxial opening of either &#945;- or &#946;-iodonium ions. The major product from the reaction in acetonitrile was one of ring contraction. No cis product was formed in this reaction but an elimination product was present. Products from the latter reaction were postulated as arising from trans-diequatorial or trans-diaxial opening of either &#945;- or &#946;-iodonium ions. The reaction of sodium azide-iodine-crown ether with 3-methyl-5&#945;-androst-2-ene in chloroform gave a high yield of the same product as those obtained in the reaction with iodine(I) azide in acetonitrile. The reaction of thallium(I) azide-iodine in dichloromethane with the above alkene gave products which could have all arisen via a c-3 carbocation. Solvolysis of the trans-iodo-azides of 5&#945;-androst-2-ene with silver(I) acetate in acetic acid occurred with retention of configuration showing that azide acted as a neighbouring group in the reaction. Solvolysis of the trans-iodo-azide(94) of 3-methyl-5&#945;-androst-2-ene gave, inter alia, a product where azide migration had occurred. Solvolysis of the trans-iodo-azide(95) gave mainly products of elimination. The action of iodine(I) azide on 3-methylene-5&#945;-androstane and 1-mewthylene-4-tert-butylcyclohexane was examined and found to be non-regio- and non-stereo-specific. Iodo-azides were also formed from 3-tert-butylcyclohexene and 3-methoxycyclohexene. In each reaction the major product was that of trans-diaxial opening of the cis-iodonium ion, while the second major product arose by trans-diequatorial opening of the trans-iodonium ion. The ratio of diaxial to diequatorial product varied with the iodo-azide-producing system being used, and was larger in the case of 3-methoxy-cyclohexene, especially when the solvent was dichloromethane. A mechanism was postulated which involves reversible formation of iodonium ions as the fast step followed by rate-limiting attack by azide ions. Solvolysis of these iodo-azides was also investigated. Prior to the current work, both an AdE2 and an Ad3 mechanism had been postulated for the addition of iodine(I) azide to alkenes and in an attempt to distinguish between these possibilities a kinetic study was initiated. Preliminary results indicate that the reaction with cyclohexene is electrophilic and second order.</field><field name="date">1977</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2144</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies in Cancer Chemotherapy</field><field name="creator">Dean, Ian Christopher</field><field name="description">The role of metals in biological processes has been discussed with particular emphasis on the importance of chelation.

A number of new amidoximes and hydroxylamine have been made from the appropriate imidoyl chloride and a hydroxylaqine. The spectral and chelating properties of these compounds are discussed. All the compounds have been submitted to the anticancer screening programme of the National Cancer Institute. The results available so far are presented and indicate that the compounds are toxic but inactive against experimental tumours. Sodium sulphide reduces a-phenyl-o-nitro-cinnamonitrile (106) to 2-amino-3-phenylquinoline-1-oxide (107) in good yield. Extension of the reduction to other o-nitrocinnamonitriles gives very poor results. The spectral properties, configurations and conformations of the o-nitrocinnamonitriles are discussed. The 12-aminoquinoline-1-oxide group is shown to form solid metal complexes. That from 2-amino-3-phenylquinoline-1-oxide (107) with nickel has been prepared.

The first quantitative description of the extraction process was, however, not made until 1941 when Kolthoff and Sandell compared experimental data with theoretical predictions for the extraction of metal dithizonates. They found that the theory they proposed was valid under wide experimental conditions. However, the systems used by Kolthoff and Sandell were simple ones and hence relatively simple theory was used to successfully explain their behaviour. In practice solvent extraction systems are complicated by other factors, e.g. hydrolysis, polymerisation and complex formation in the aqueous phase. It has subsequently become apparent that such factors have an important influence on the solvent extraction of chelates. Several authors have published reports since 1941 on the theory of solvent extraction of metal chelates which take these factors into account. In particular two publications by Irving, Rossotti and Williams and Stary (chapter 3) should be noted for their comprehensive treatment of the subject. The influence of these factors will be discussed in the following sections.</field><field name="date">1972</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences::250200 Inorganic Chemistry::250202 Main group metal chemistry</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2146</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Aspects of the chemistry of titanium dioxide in fused salt solvents</field><field name="creator">Udy, David John</field><field name="description">An investigation into the chemistry of solutions of titanium dioxide in fused alkali metal borates has been made, with the emphasis on the ability of the alkali borate melts to dissolve TiO2 and subsequently crystallize TiO2 and/or complex alkali metal titanates. The preparation and properties of potassium titanates with K2O/TiO2 mol ratio &#8804;1 has been studied. In addition the thermal decomposition of potassium hexafluorotitanate monohydrate (reported to yield potassium tetratitanate) has been investigated. The decomposition product has been identified as an oxyfluorotitanate. The compounds crystallized on slow cooling of alkali borate + TiO2 melts have been identified. The titanium containing product(s) have been correlated with the concentration of borate groups containing non-bridging oxygens, which depends on the alkali metal cation. Phase diagrams for the M2O.B2O3 + TiO2 (M = Na, K) systems have been obtained. Mass transport in M2O.2B2O3 + TiO2 (M = Li, Na, K) systems has been studied, via measurements of electrical conductivity, as a function of temperature and TiO2 concentration. Additional information on the alkali borate melts has been obtained from measurements of the optical basicity of M2O + B2O3 (M = Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs) glasses, using Pb(II) as probe ion. The results of these measurements have confirmed that the nature of the alkali metal cation significantly affects the basicity of fused alkali borate solvents. Extraction of TiO2 from ilmenite and titaniferous slag, using selected low-basicity alkali borate solvents has been attempted. The results indicate that TiO2 may be separated from ilmenite in essentially a one-step process.</field><field name="date">1973</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences::250200 Inorganic Chemistry::250202 Main group metal chemistry</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2147</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Synthetic studies in reduction and rearrangement</field><field name="creator">Rewcastle, Gordon William</field><field name="description">PART ONE SYNTHESIS AND ACID-CATALYSED REARRANGEMENT OF CYCLOPROPANE-1,2-DIOLS A number of cyclopropane-1,2-diyl diacetates have been synthesized by the anhydrous Clemmensen reduction [Zn(Hg)-HCl-organic solvent] of &#946;-diketones and &#946;-ketoaldehydes, and this reaction was found to be a general one for those substrates that did not exist mainly in the enol form. Cyclopropanediol formation does occur with some highly enolized compounds under aqueous conditions but, with the anhydrous system, enol acetate formation or enolic reduction was found to compete with reduction of the diketo form. Acid-catalysed rearrangement of the free diols generally gave &#945;-hydroxy-ketones, or their corresponding &#945;&#946;-unsaturated enones, with &#946;-hydroxy-ketone formation only being observed with one substrate. A strong preference for methyl ketone formation was observed in all cases and this phenomenon was rationalized by consideration of the apparent relative thermodynamic stabilities of the &#945;-ketol conjugate acids. PART TWO AROMATIZATION OF 2&#945;-HYDROXY[4-13C]CHOLEST-4-EN-3-ONE The aromatization of 2&#945;-hydroxy[4-13C]cholest-4-en-3-one has been found to occur with migration of the labelled carbon to C-10, thereby lending support to previous mechanistic proposals. The aromatization of [4-13C]cholesta-1,4-dien-3-one similarly gave a product with the label at C-10, in agreement with earlier work involving carbon-14 labelling studies. The ease with which these rearrangements could be studied is in marked contrast to earlier work, and the combination of carbon-13 labelling and 13C n.m.r. spectroscopy offers many advantages over the degradative techniques required with carbon-14 labelling. PART THREE CLEMMENSEN REDUCTION OF (5R)-5-HYDROXYHEXAN-2-ONE Previous work in this department suggested that the Clemmensen reduction of &#947;-substituted ketones involved an intramolecular displacement of the &#947;-substituent by the carbonyl oxygen atom. However, the reduction of (5R)-5-hydroxyhexan-2-one had given a mixture of hexan-2-ol and cis- and trans-hex-4-en-2-ol, with no inversion of stereochemistry occurring with the saturated isomer. The opposite signs of rotation for the two geometrically isomeric alkenols suggested the possibility of different chiralities, but this was disproved when the 2R-configuration was determined for each alcohol by analysis of the 1H n.m.r. spectra of the esters with (-)-(S)-&#945;-methoxy-&#945;-trifluoromethyl-phenylacetic acid. This result thus invalidates the earlier hypothesis.</field><field name="date">1978</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences::250300 Organic Chemistry</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2148</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ring C Transformations of Podocarpic Acid</field><field name="creator">Missen, Alan William</field><field name="description">This thesis describes Further studies on the utilisation of the diterpenoid natural product , 12-hydrxypodocarpa-8,11,13-trim 19-oic acid* (podocarpic acid) (1) .

Accordingly, it has been speculated that musical training results in neural structural and functional differences between musicians and non-musicians. In particular, there is evidence to indicate parietal regions are more equally lateralized in musicians, but research investigating visuospatial abilities and lateralization in musicians is scarce. Studies 1 and 2 aimed to assess the visuospatial ability and cognitive processing speed of adult musicians versus &#8234;demographically and educationally matched non-musicians. &#8234;Musicians performed more quickly and more accurately than non-musicians in two tasks of visuospatial ability, and completed more items than non-musicians in three tasks of processing speed, suggesting &#8234;musicians had better &#8234;visuospatial ability and a faster speed of processing. Studies 3 and 4 aimed to investigate &#8234;visuospatial attention in &#8234;these groups using a line-bisection task and a visual discrimination task. On both tasks musicians demonstrated more balanced visuospatial attention with a slight bias to the right hemispace, which was in contrast to the non-musicians&#8217; bias to the left hemispace, a natural phenomenon known as &#8216;right pseudoneglect&#8217;. In Study 5, the laterality of visual processing in musicians and non-musicians was further investigated by comparing electrophysiological interhemispheric transfer time (IHTT) of lateralized visual stimuli across the corpus callosum. Non-musicians had faster right-to-left than left-to-right IHTT consistent with previous research, whilst musicians had more balanced IHTT in both directions and faster left-to-right transfer than non-musicians. Absolute latency patterns revealed similar results and consistently demonstrated more balanced visual processing in musicians. The behavioural data, analysed in Study 6, revealed a tendency (n.s.) for the &#8234;musician group to respond more quickly to stimuli presented in the right visual field than to stimuli presented in the left visual field, whilst &#8234;non-musicians did not show this pattern. Overall, the results indicate that musicians have enhanced visuospatial ability and are less lateralized for visuospatial attention and perception than non-musicians.

Specifically, it is proposed that musical training in early life may elicit a process of myelination that is more bilaterally distributed than myelination in non-musicians.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">musician</field><field name="subject">visuospatial</field><field name="subject">laterality</field><field name="subject">N1</field><field name="subject">music</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2367</field></doc><doc><field name="title">To rent or to buy? housing tenure choice in New Zealand, 1960-80</field><field name="creator">Chapman, R. B.</field><field name="description">This study analyses the economic aspects of housing tenure choice in New Zealand, 1960-80. The analysis proceeds by way of the building, refining and estimation of a model of household tenure choice, using a considerable body of micro-level data and aggregate time series. It is argued that the household faces a wealth constraint, a dual budget constraint, and minimum dwelling standard constraints, and that the household's tenure choice depends on the interaction of these constraints and its preference set. The budget constraint is a dual constraint because the true economic price of buying relative to that of renting generally differs from the 'outlay' price of buying relative to that of renting. The outlay prices of housing services are important for households with limited current income available for housing unless the household's wealth constraint is unusually loose. Considerable emphasis is placed on the modelling of the prices of housing services. A sub-model of landlord behaviour and the examination of the operation of the private rental housing market are directed at explaining the path over time of urban New Zealand rents. Sources of data are as follows. In considering prices and the various constraints on tenure choice I employ my own survey data, collected in Auckland, and time-series data from the New Zealand Department of Statistics (NZDS) and the New Zealand Valuation Department, together with crosstabulation data from various sources. I make use for the first time (for these purposes) of a body of data collected by the NZDS - their Household Sample Survey data - to estimate a cross-sectional tenure choice function. For the examination of national tenure choice trends I had to construct my own estimates of the private sector home-ownership rate. The chief conclusion of this study is that lack of wealth constrains the large majority of 'unwilling' private tenants (who are about three-quarters of all private tenants) to rent. Both interview evidence and cross-sectional econometric work support this conclusion. A second major finding is that the impact of the budget constraint on household tenure choice has varied considerably over time but in terms of economic prices, buying has been consistently (over the last two decades) cheaper than renting for the typical tenure-choosing household with a moderate marginal rate of time preference and a moderate planning period. In times of rapid dwelling appreciation the economic price of buying relative to that of renting is particularly low. In contrast, the outlay price of buying (comprising costs in the current period) has been considerably greater than the outlay price of renting, especially when nominal interest rates have been high, and this fact has undoubtedly deterred a significant a significant proportion of households from buying. Finally, the decline in the private sector home-ownership rate between 1961 and 1976 was found to be largely due to changes in the 'age:marital status:household size' structure of the population of households. These changes outweighed the net effect of economic factors which worked to raise the home-ownership rate until 1976.</field><field name="date">1981</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::340000 Economics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2176</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A structural investigation of "tetrahedral" stereochemistry in copper (II) complexes</field><field name="creator">Cheeseman, Trevor Percival</field><field name="description">The discovery of transition metal complexes of stoichiometries different from those expected on purely valence grounds led Werner to propound his classical co-ordination theory, therein recognising in these metal atoms a property of great significance to chemistry, and which even now is not fully understood. Through the study of geometrical and optical isomers Werner and later workers deduced the importance of specifio stereochemical arrangements in these molecules and their nature has been a subject of enquiry ever since. Not only has it been repeatedly found that the lighter transition metals exhibit tetrahedral, planar and octahedral stereochemistry but it has also become clear that certain metals prefer a specific arrangement and will not normally adopt another - leading to the set of generalisations which maintain for example that "nickel is never tetrahedral." The application of physical techniques and the growth of quantum chemistry allowed a more rigorous view of these observations and led to the valence bond theory of Pauling. This theory, particularly when later modified by Taube, laid great emphasis on covalent bonding between metal and ligand and consequently on the highly directional nature of the atomic orbitals involved. These were the hybridised orbitals of the metal which in the particular combinations sp3, dsp2 and d2sp3 accounted for the generally observed tetrahedral, planar and octahedral stereochemistry of complexes. Tne theory furthermore provided an explanation for many of the magnetic properties of these compounds and, in a general way, for their reactivity so that a strong impression grew that the stereochemistry of any complex was simply a function of the orbital hybridisation of its central metal atom.</field><field name="date">1964</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2164</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies on the ribonucleic acids of subcellular fractions</field><field name="creator">Bergquist, Peter.

It has become increasingly apparent to biochemists that a mixture of enzymes, substrates and products in a single phase could hardly carry out the many reaction sequences that must be involved in the metabolic transformations conducted by the cell.  Thus attention has been increasingly directed to the study of the discrete units of the cell with respect to chemical constitution and biological function.  The pioneering studies of Bensley and Hoerr (1934) and Claude (1946) on cellular fractionalism have led to what is now a powerful approach to the study of living cells - smashing them and studying the pieces.  The first objective of cellular fractionation is to find out what reactions take place and what compounds occur in the various isolated systems.  A second objective is to reassemble the pieces and relate their activities in various combinations to the activities of the whole cell.</field><field name="date">1961</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2158</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An integrated process for the recovery of clinically significant trace proteins from human plasma</field><field name="creator">Benny, Athol Graeme</field><field name="description">Methods for the preparation of concentrates of factor VIII, factor IX, high purity factor IX, Cl esterase inhibitor, specific immunoglobulin and platelet factor XIII are described. These procedures were developed or modified with the aim of integration into an automated process that would allow sequential recovery of all the clinically significant trace proteins from a single plasma pool. Concomitant recovery of important proteins such as transferrin, alpha-1-antitrypsin and platelet-derived growth factor was considered. A high-purity factor VIII concentrate heat-treated at 80&#176;C for 96 h was prepared by a process that incorporated heparin fractionation. This method was shown to be suitable for assimilation into an existing regional blood processing laboratory. Several ion-exchange procedures for the recovery of factor IX were evaluated and higher purification of a factor IX concentrate was achieved on a new cellulose-based chromatographic medium. A chromatographic procedure for the preparation of a heat-treated high-purity Cl esterase inhibitor concentrate was described and the performance of a new cellulose-based desalting medium was evaluated in comparison with ultrafiltration. A heat-treated specific immunoglobulin concentrate was prepared from side-stream fractions of an automated chromatographic process for the production of albumin concentrate, and a pilot study for the fractionation of outdated platelet concentrates was carried out with the aim preparing components of potential therapeutic value.

Alumina is also expected to have good flow and handling properties, and dissolve well in the bath. Unfortunately, it does not always dissolve rapidly and this leads to the formation of "sludge", which creates operating disturbances in the cell; it is difficult to remedy this problem without a basic understanding of the process of alumina dissolution. Consequently, the objective of the work presented in this thesis was to develop an apparatus and technique that would allow the dissolution behaviour of powder alumina to be measured as realistically and objectively as possible, and then determine the important factors affecting dissolution. The method developed involved the merging of three different techniques: &#9679; electroanalytical measurement of dissolved oxide concentrations &#9679; recording of the associated thermal phenomena &#9679; visual observation of the interaction of alumina with the bath which were then used to investigate the effect of a range of alumina properties and smelter operating conditions on dissolution behaviour. A series of dissolution parameters was selected to evaluate the relative dissolution behaviour of the different variables. It was found that slow dissolution behaviour resulted primarily from poor feeding and/or dispersion, coupled with poor heat transfer in the first few seconds of the dissolution process. If the flow properties of the alumina were good, alumina flowed easily out of the dropper on to the surface of the bath forming relatively thin but well-distributed rafts. If not, alumina could flow out into a localized area producing very dense rafts which clumped together and eventually sank to the bottom forming sludge. properties such as loss on ignition enhanced the dispersion of the alumina through the release of volatiles, which caused the alumina to "effervesce" on the surface. Conversely, bulk density aggravated the clumping problem as the density of the formed rafts increased with increasing bulk density. Good feeder design can help to counteract deficiencies in the flow properties of an alumina, if the importance of wide coverage and the imparting of a horizontal velocity component to the alumina are kept in mind. It was also found that if the bath agitation was increased, either by increasing the amount of existing stirring or by reducing the bath volume in the feeding area for a given bath velocity, the initial heat transfer to the alumina could be dramatically improved. The presence of bath superheat was important for maintaining optimum heat transfer conditions for fast dissolutions, as alumina was found to dissolve better when a higher proportion of the heat required was supplied from the bulk of the liquid bath as opposed to localized freezing. Increasing the initial alumina concentration in the electrolyte retarded the dissolution process, with the retardation becoming increasingly more significant at higher concentration values. Similarly, reducing the cryolite ratio, which also decreased the alumina solubility, resulted in the dissolution being inhibited in the later stages, as more alumina dissolved. In situations where the mass transfer in the bath was improved, the impact of these concentration effects was minimized. The video recordings were useful for indicating potential operating difficulties with the samples, such as excessive emissions and flow problems. Six different raft formations, characterizing the degree of bath surface coverage and the raft density or cohesion, were identified from the videos and the aluminas were classified accordingly. Preliminary heat balance calculations were performed using the data obtained in this study and were used to estimate the heat of dissolution for &#945;-Al2O3, for a variety of alumina concentrations in cryolite-based electrolytes. The results indicated heat values of 112&#177;15 and 55&#177;5 kJ mol-1 for alumina concentrations in the bath of 0.43 and 2.83 wt% respectively. Further work is necessary to refine these calculations, however. Reacted ore was found to dissolve more slowly than parent virgin alumina but it was difficult to ascertain which property caused the difference - whether bulk density, flowability, influence of HF, or presence of other impurities. As a result, it is recommended that a series of dissolution runs be performed on reacted samples of different compositions to establish which property associated with reacted ore causes the problem.</field><field name="date">1990</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2159</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation of students&#8217; understanding and representation of derivative in a graphic calculator-mediated teaching and learning environment</field><field name="creator">Delos Santos, Alan Gil Gutierrez</field><field name="description">This research is a collective case study that investigates the constitutive relationship between students' representational competences and mathematical understanding of derivative. Its goal was to describe the representational abilities characterising different ways of knowing, and these were categorised as procedure-oriented, process-oriented, object-oriented, concept-oriented and versatile. The study was conducted in four Form 7 classrooms, in their Mathematics with Calculus classes, where graphic calculators were used in the teaching and learning of derivative. The choice of the context was based on the belief that the use of graphic calculators might encourage a multi-representational approach to teaching, and support the development of students' multi-representational way of thinking. The research data were collected both from teachers and their students. These data comprise teacher and student interviews, with the first interviews conducted before their lessons on derivative and the second after the lesson. The students were also given pre-lesson and post-lesson tests in order to triangulate student data. A Representational Framework of Knowing Derivative was constructed as an analysis tool, and used to explore students' representational abilities and ways of knowing. From the analysis, the students' cognitive processes were construed, together with the nature of their representational, cognitive and conceptual schemas. The representational framework of knowing was later refined to present an empirically-based theoretical framework that bridges the gap between what was theorised and what was observed. The results of the study suggest that the relationship between students' ways of knowing and their representational abilities is mediated by the following factors: (i) the students' interpretation of the mathematical notion; (ii) the representational nature of their interpretations of derivative, and the representational aspects in their problem solving activities; and (iii) the nature of the representational links that they have formed between procedures, processes, objects and sub-concepts that were construed to constitute their conceptual and cognitive schemas of derivative. With regard to the use of the graphic calculator, this research has noted a possible contribution of the graphic calculator in the development of students' multi-representational ways of thinking and learning.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::230000 Mathematical Sciences::230100 Mathematics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2161</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cyclic deformation of a clay</field><field name="creator">Bacchus, David Robin</field><field name="description">Dynamic loading tests consisting of one hundred sinusoidal strain-controlled cycles at 0.2 cps. followed by a compression test to failure were conducted on remoulded, fully saturated clay triaxial specimens. Electrical transducers coupled with automatic recording equipment were used to measure pore-pressure, axial load and deformation. The effects of strain amplitude and stress history on the peak shear stresses, the mean effective stress and the specific damping energy were investigated. Mean effective stress, which showed negligible cyclic variation, decreased progressively during dynamic loading except that for over-consolidated soils it increased during the first cycle only. Progressive reduction of peak shear stress and specific damping energy was closely related to the reduction of mean effective stress. After 100 cycles the strength and structure of the clay was dependent on the void ratio and the dynamic strain amplitude. All effects were more marked with increasing strain amplitude. A descriptive model was proposed to account for the development of unusual &#8216;S&#8217;-shaped loops.</field><field name="date">1969</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2165</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fast 2D shape approximation algorithms and their errors</field><field name="creator">Friedrich, W. E.</field><field name="description">In this thesis, efficient algorithms for fast shape approximation in the area of machine and robot vision are analysed. The core of the thesis consits of two main parts, an error analysis of chain coded silhouettes and a simplified, hence fast shape approximation scheme for practical applications. The area of shape description and approximation is introduced. General techniques for processing of boundary data are outlined followed by a brief description of the image processing system which was developed during the study. Processing procedures developed and their options are presented. Two applications realized by the author have emerged from the algorithm development, firstly a semi-automatic shape registration and measurement procedure and secondly, a low-cost robot vision system. The advantage of the experimental robot vision system is an effective communication between the robot and the object recognition system. The shortcomings of these applications, mainly inaccuracy of the shape description lead to the introduction of an error analysis for boundary descriptors. In contrast to existing methods, the error analysis can be applied to straight lines, circular arcs, and arbitrary shapes consisting of these two shape primitives. The analysis is comprehensive and covers all kinds of chain code sets representing various pixel shapes as well as different pixel configurations. The results of the analysis lead to the development of simple ways of overcoming the accuracy limitations of conventional methods. Two algorithms for improving the length estimation of object outlines are introduced. A comparison with existing methods showing the effectiveness of these algorithms is made. For practical applications of object recognition, a new, simple and hence fast and effective algorithm for polygon approximation, called the "arc operator" is developed. The combination of the arc operator and the length correcting algorithm directly improves the ability to identify partially visible shapes. The performance of the arc operator is compared to six other well known algorithms. Slight disadvantages in accuracy are outweighed by the enormous advantage in processing time, particularly with an integer implementation. An example of overlapping parts demonstrates the potential of the arc operator to extract characteristic shape descriptions.</field><field name="date">1989</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290500 Mechanical and Industrial Engineering::290501 Mechanical engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2156</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Extended theory of the Be&#769;nard convection problem</field><field name="creator">Nield, Donald A.</field><field name="description">The onset of convection in a horizontal fluid layer, heated from below, is, examined by means of perturbation analysis. The resulting eigenvalue system of equations is solved by means of a new extension of a Fourier series technique. Two sets of coupled effects are investigated: (i) thermal buoyancy and surface-tension effects, and (ii) thermal buoyancy and solute buoyancy effects. For the first set of effects the magnetohydrodynamic problem is also studied. For the surface-tension problem, attention is focussed on the case where the lower boundary is a rigid conductor and the upper free surface is subject to a general thermal condition. It is found that for this care the surface-tension and buoyancy forces reinforce each other and are tightly coupled. Cells formed by surface tension are approximately the same size as those formed by buoyancy. The stream line patterns produced by the two agencies acting separately are again similar. When the fluid is electrically conducting and is in the presence of a vertical magnetic field, it is found that the field always has a stabilizing effect. When convection cells are formed in the presence of such a field, their horizontal dimensions are less than for cells formed in the absence of the field. The magnetic field accentuates the difference between the cells induced by surface tension and those by buoyancy, and thus reduces the coupling between the destabilizing forces. Increase of magnetic field causes the buoyancy cell pattern to become more symmetrical, but causes the streamlines in surface-tension cells to become bunched near the surface. When the magnetic field is large, the transition from one type of cell to the other type is extremely sudden, at least when the upper surface is a good thermal conductor. It has been found that, on the model considered, there can be no oscillatory for this problem. However, dimensional analysis reveals that, for a sufficiently flexible upper surface, oscillatory Instability might in fact occur. Finally the thermohaline problem, where the density varies with both temperature and the concentration of some solute, is studied. The eigenvalue equation is now found for general boundary conditions. The degree of coupling between the thermal and the solute effects again depends on the similarity between convection cells caused by the two agencies acting separately. (For one extreme case studied the coupling is zero for a certain range of parameters.) In this problem both monotonic and oscillatory instability can now occur.</field><field name="date">1966</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2162</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The radiolysis of aqueous solutions of cysteine</field><field name="creator">Winchester, Robert Victor</field><field name="description">The radiolysis of cysteine in both deaerated and oxygenated solution at pH 7 has been studied.

The rate constant for the reaction &#8226;OH + RSH &#8594; RS&#8226; + H2O has been measured by competition with paranitrosodimethylaniline. A value of 9 x 109 was found, which though not absolutely accurate (for reasons described in the text) is sufficiently accurate to that the reaction is fast.

From the values of G(-RSH), G(RSSR), and G(H2O2) in oxygenated solution, and from the effects of the scavengers nitrous oxide and acetone or these values a mechanism has been proposed in which RS radicals produced by attack of primary species on cysteine propagate a chain, the rate of the propagation reaction depending on the cysteine concentration. The autoxidation of cysteine has been studied briefly, the rate being found proportional to oxygen concentration.

This "peak shift" effect has been found following training in which S1 and S2 were presented successively, but not when they were presented simultaneously. In the present study peak shift was obtained when S1 and S2 were presented simultaneously during training. In order to isolate the conditions necessary to produce peak shift after simultaneous training, different groups of pigeons were given variations in procedure, but peak shift was obtained with all groups. The variations included using stimuli from various physical dimensions, using different training procedures, and using various methods of presenting stimuli during the tests for peak shift. The results were generally more consistent with discrimination theories that postulate the interaction of generalisation gradients around S1 and S2, rather than with theories that postulate control by some relationship between S1 and S2, and in particular, they were most consistent with explanations of peak shift that propose that the responding occurring in the presence of S1 is inhibited in the presence of S2.</field><field name="date">1973</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2166</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Marine Jurassic and Lower Cretaceous of southern Xizang (Tibet): bivalve assemblages, correlation, paleoenvironments and paleogeography</field><field name="creator">Li, Xiaochi</field><field name="description">This study is based on 15 measured Jurassic to Lower Cretaceous sections and their abundant bivalve faunas distributed mainly in the Nyalam and Gamba districts of southern Xizang. It addresses the establishment of bivalve assemblages, stratigraphic subdivision and correlation, analysis of sedimentary environments, sea-level change and paleogeography in light of the tectonic framework and geological evolution of the Xizang Plateau. The Plateau consists of three terranes: Qangtang, Gangdise and Himalaya They are separated by the sutures: Kunlun-Hoh Xil-Jingsha Jiang, Banggong Co-Nu Jiang, and Yarlu Zangbo Jiang, which represent three closed oceans: Paleo-Tethys, Neo-Tethys and South Xizang Sea. Stratigraphic development of the Jurassic and Lower Cretaceous of southern Xizang is especially closely related to the evolution of the South Xizang Sea Bivalves are one of the most common and important Jurassic and Early Cretaceous fossil groups in the Plateau. From 15 measured sections, 51 bivalve species within 26 genera are described, including 3 new genera and 14 new species. New genera: Vanustus, Yoldioides, Antipectenoides New species: Nuculoma oriens (Nuculidae) Yoldioides jurianoides (Malletiidae) Mesosaccella gangbaensis (Nuculanidae) M. Orienta Grammatodon (Indogrammatodon) sinensis (Parallelodontidae) Oxytoma jiabulensis (Oxytomidae) Meleagrinella minima M. dongshangensis M. sinensis Entolium dongshangensis (Entoliidae) Antipectenoides sinensis Ctenoides shizangensis (Limidae) Anisocardia shizangensis (Arcticidae) Protodiceras lanonglaensis (Megalodontidae) A stratigraphic sequence of ten different bivalve assemblages and four Buchia faunas from the Jurassic to Lower Cretaceous of Nyalam district, and four Jurassic bivalve faunas from the Gamba district are recognised. In addition, the Oxytoma jiabulensis bed and two Meleagrinella beds are also recognised. These assemblages can be seen to be of two types, high and low diversity, indicating different sedimentary environments. These assemblages along with co-existing ammonites also provide a good basis for stratigraphic division and correlation of the sequences. Special attention is given to nomenclatural and other problems associated with the important genus Buchia:. Australobuchia Zakharov is believed to be inseparable generically, and some Xizang species of Buchia an placed in synonymy. On this basis the evolution and migration of the genus is discussed From measured sections in southern Xizang, a comparatively complete Jurassic- Lower Cretaceous sequence has been established, which includes six formations: (in ascending order) Pupugar. Nieniexiongla. Lanongla. Menbu. Xuomo and Gucocun Formations. A new stratigraphic unit, the Gangdong Formation, is established, for Mid-Upper Jurassic strata of the Gamba district. Direct and indirect biostratigraphic correlation within China and between southern Xizang and other places around Gondwanaland is well established. Lithologic features, sedimentary structures and bivalve assemblages allow four environments including nine lithofacies to be recognised in southern Xizang: 1. Inner shelf environment 1] Shoreface sandstone facies 2] Neritic terrigenous clastic facies 3] Open shelf carbonate facies 4] Protected barrier carbonate facies 5] Reef limestone facie 2. Outer shelf environment 6] Siltstone-shale-carbonate facies 3. Slope environment 7] Fine clastic facies 8] Pelagic limestone facies 4. Bathyal environment 9] Dark Buchia-ammonite-lutite facies They can be seen to be organised into sedimentary cycles, which clearly show a huge transgression with three peaks in the Upper Jurassic reaching a maximum at the top of the Jurassic (Upper Tithonian). In the Lower and Middle Jurassic, sea-level changes fluctuated between coastal and shelf-sea environments, whereas in the Upper Jurassic, as a result of sea-floor spreading in the South Xizang Sea and the formation of fault basins, the area descended into bathyal depths. Paleogeographically, the northern part of the Plateau (i.e. the Northern Branch, or Neo-Tethys) underwent a shallowing process along with areal extension during Jurassic times, but shrank in the Early Cretaceous, whereas in the Southern Branch, during Jurassic-Early Cretaceous times, the South Xizang Sea developed a wide variety of sedimentary environments, including inner and outer shelf sea, continental slope and bathyal fault basin.</field><field name="date">1990</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::260000 Earth Sciences::260100 Geology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2167</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Management of Senior Managers: How Firms in New Zealand Acquire, Defend and Extract Value from their Senior Managerial Resources</field><field name="creator">Gilbert, John</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350200 Business and Management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2168</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Demospongiae of New Zealand-Systematics, distribution and relationships</field><field name="creator">Bergquist, Patricia R.</field><field name="description">The scope of the present work is the systematic revision of the Demospongiae of the N.Z. region, here defined as including North and South Is. and all outlying islands as far north as Three Kings and South to Auckland and Cambell Is.

One of the main purposes of the programme was to provide a unified theme for post-graduate research in the department. The initial aim of the programme was to develop through graduate research, sufficient facilities for radio astronomy observations at frequencies below 100Mhz.  Being among the first group of graduate students in the programme, the author was given the problem of studying the antenna requirements for the programme. At the frequencies concerned, the antenna systems are often large and expensive. As the programme is supported at present, only by funds for ordinary graduate research, there is a great need for an antenna array with good performance at minimal cost. This has led the author into his main field of study, viz. the synthesis of arrays with non-uniformly spaced directional elements. The use of directional elements together with non-uniform spacing technique permits larger inter-element spacings in the array without resulting in large sidelobes in the response pattern.  Available synthesis methods are inadequate despite the large number of papers published on the subject since its introduction 7 years ago. The synthesis problem involves the determination of a set of element positions to give a desirable response pattern. Because the element position variables lie in the arguments of the cosine terms in the pattern function, the problem becomes highly non-linear. For simplicity, most of the published works have assumed isotropic elements. The methods proposed have been mainly centred on some form of linear approximations to the problem. Consequently, these methods are only effective over a limited region of space*. As a result of this limitation, good pattern characteristics can only be achieved with impractically small spacings. For arrays with less than about 50 elements, the element spacings can best be determined by an optimisation procedure. This method involves the repeated application of small pertubations to the element positions of a starting array until maximum improvement to the sidelobe levels of the array is achieved. An efficient perturbation method has been proposed by Baklanov et al using a matrix approach. Because of the inherent limitation of this method, Baklanov&#8217;s arrays are mostly impractical due to the occurrence of small spacings. Such limitations are removed by the author through the use of a modified synthesis procedure. With this new procedure, the author was able to control the pattern over a considerably larger area in space. Thus arrays with average inter-element spacings up to two wavelengths can be synthesised with positive control over all sidelobes in the arrays. The sidelobe levels of the author&#8217;s arrays are, as a whole, bery close to the levels of the corresponding theoretically optimal patterns. The element directivities are taken into account in the synthesis process. A total of 30 non-uniformly spaced arrays of varying sizes and sidelobe levels were synthesised using the method developed. Since all these arrays have near to optimal sidelobe characteristics, they provide a basis for a detailed study of the properties of non-uniformly spaced arrays as a whole. A number of interesting points are revealed when pattern parameters like gain, beamwidth, sidelobe level, etc., are studied in relation with the spacing characteristics of the arrays. A better understanding of the properties of non-uniformly spaced arrays is also gained by comparing the pattern characteristics of the synthesised arrays with that of current tapered arrays.  The design and testing of a 16-element non-uniformly spaced array of Yagi antennas is described in Chapter 4. This array demonstrates one practical application of the synthesis work reported in this thesis. *The word &#8216;space&#8217; used throughout the Introduction does not mean the physical space, which is defined, in a 2-D case, by the zenith angle &#952;.

Exploratory case study is made of three healthcare provider organisations: community health service; independent practitioner association; Maori health network. Three research models are developed to examine identified gaps and areas of interest in healthcare quality management literature. The first model relates to differences between generic standards and specification standards. The second model relates to the fit of healthcare service delivery systems and ISO 9000. The third model relates to exploration of the linkages and co-ordination of an integrated care delivery network. One proposition and two hypotheses are developed in relation to the models, and are closely associated with gaps in healthcare service quality knowledge. Strong support is found for the first hypothesis though not the second hypothesis, and there are also some unexpected results. There is strong support that the process of implementing the ISO 9000 model will enhance healthcare management performance, even though the outcomes are unpredictable. There are indications supporting the notion that implementation of the ISO 9000 model will increase effective linkages and co-ordination within integrated care delivery networks. The body of evidence accumulated during the study did not, however, permit a valid conclusion regarding the hypothesis. The findings of the study can be extended to other healthcare service areas and through interpretation and extrapolation they add value to healthcare service quality research in general. In particular, the findings of the three case studies in this research suggest that future models for healthcare service quality should include a comprehensive generic model for quality management of individual and integrated healthcare service organisations.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences::280100 Information Systems::280102 Information systems management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2180</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The high strain-rate compressive behaviour of beta-brass single crystals</field><field name="creator">Ferguson, W. G.</field><field name="description">The work described in this thesis represents an investigation undertaken with the two-fold purpose of (a) establishing the apparatus and techniques necessary for carrying out investigations into the response of metals to dynamic loading, and (b) examining the response of beta-brass single crystals to dynamic loading. The first part of the investigation required the development of basic apparatus for investigations of the type planned. This apparatus included a dynamic compression testing machine and apparatus for the production and preparation of metal single crystals. The second part of the investigation required the assessing of the existing knowledge of the static and dynamic properties of beta-brass and the planning of a programme aimed at contributing to this knowledge. A review of the existing literature is presented and a programme of tests is outlined. As a result of the investigation the following conclusions were drawn concerning the static and dynamic properties of beta-brass single crystals. The dynamic upper and lower yield stresses were found to be strain-rate sensitive and the upper yield stress increased by up to 4.5 times the static yield stress. The dynamic upper and lower yield stresses were found to be temperature dependent and to show the same temperature dependence as the static yield stress. Both increasing strain-rate and decreasing temperature raised the yield stress. The dynamically deformed material showed large yield drops whereas the statically deformed material did not. Both the static and dynamic work hardening behaviour were found to be orientation dependent. The rate of work hardening for the static tests increased with decreasing temperature whereas that for the dynamic tests did not. The dynamic work hardening behaviour was insensitive to strain-rate. At strains greater than 4 per cent the dynamically deformed material was found to be softer than that statically deformed the same amount. Both the statically and dynamically tested material deformed by slip and the formation of deformation bands. Twinning was not observed. Jerky flow was found to be composition and temperature sensitive.</field><field name="date">1964</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2188</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cell performance and anodic processes in aluminium smelting studied by product gas analysis</field><field name="creator">Dorreen, Mark Murray Radley</field><field name="description">Aluminium smelting is an energy intensive process, and as a result there has been considerable and ongoing research over a number of decades on the energy efficiency of various aspects of the process. One of the most important measures is current efficiency, which has been shown to have direct relationships with current density, cell temperature, electrolyte chemistry, and anode-cathode distance. The effects of these variables on current efficiency are generally accepted, however there remains debate over the influence of the alumina concentration in the electrolyte on current efficiency. This research relied upon the development of a laboratory scale aluminium smelting cell where the current efficiency was measured via sampling of the product gases. A modified oxygen balance was used, with gas analysis performed using online mass spectrometry. The findings of this research agreed with the accepted current efficiency trends, showing a current density influence of 17.25 %CE per A/cm2, over the range 0.3 and 1.1 A/cm2. The influence of electrolyte chemistry was -7.8 %CE per unit cryolite molar ratio, between cryolite ratios 1.99 and 3. The anode-cathode distance was shown to have no influence on current efficiency in this cell, contradicting the established findings, however this was expected because of the design of the cell with no metal pad at the cathode and therefore constant mass transfer conditions at all the anode-cathode distances used. The most significant finding concerning current efficiency is that the variation with alumina concentration is so small, -0.0376 %CE/wt% Al2O3, that there is effectively no influence. While in many other studies an influence was found, the values and direction of the relationship varied. This suggests that in many cases the observed variation in current efficiency was actually caused by a change in the level of stability in the cell, by processes such as dissolution of sludge from the cathode or the thermal disturbance of alumina feeding, whereas in this research the cell was stable under all operating conditions.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2183</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Saturated pool boiling and subcooled flow boiling of mixtures at atmospheric pressure</field><field name="creator">Wenzel, Ulrich.</field><field name="description">An experimental and theoretical investigation of heat transfer to liquid mixtures has been performed using binary and ternary mixtures of acetone, isopropanol and water. Two data-bases were established which contain measurements of the heat transfer coefficient under saturated pool boiling and subcooled flow boiling conditions. A third database comprises measurements of heat transfer and pressure drop in a plate heat exchanger. The performance of two heat transfer enhancement techniques, namely the coating of the heat transfer surface with teflon and a perforated brass foil, was studied under saturated pool boiling conditions. A model was developed, which can be used to predict the heat transfer coefficient. The model is based on the additive superposition of convective and boiling heat transfer coefficients. It is applicable for heat transfer to mixtures and single component fluids under saturated and subcooled boiling conditions. The empirical parameters in the correlations used in the model were not altered to fit the measurements of this study. The predictions of the model were compared to the experimental data, which covers the convective heat transfer regime, the transition region and the fully developed nucleate boiling regime. It was found that the best agreement between predicted an measured values was achieved, if the linear mixing law was used to calculate the ideal heat transfer coefficient rather than the correlations by Stephan-Preu&#223;er or Stephan-Abdelsalam. The heat transfer coefficient under saturated pool boiling conditions could be predicted with an accuracy of 12.6 %. A comparison between over 2000 measured heat transfer coefficients under subcooled flow boiling conditions in an annulus and the predictions of the model showed good agreement with a mean error of 10.3 %. The accuracy of the model was found to be independent of the fluid velocity and composition, as well as of the magnitude and mechanism of heat transfer. The heat flux in a plate heat exchanger could be predicted with a mean error of 6.9 % for a wide range of fluid velocities, subcoolings and compositions. The heat transfer coefficient on the test liquid side of the exchanger could be predicted with a mean error of 10 %. The heat transfer model was used for a theoretical study of the heat transfer to mixtures boiling on a finned surface. It was found that the fin geometry and thermal conductivity have a distinct influence on the local and mean heat transfer coefficients. The results indicate that the application of fins is more effective for boiling of mixtures than for boiling of single component liquids.</field><field name="date">1992</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::291400 Materials Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2190</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A land mobile radio coverage area prediction model for New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Rowe, Gerard Brendan</field><field name="description">This thesis describes research undertaken as an initial step in the development of a nationwide land mobile coverage area prediction model for New Zealand.

A secondary aim is to investigate the dynamic behaviour of a silt and the effect of variations in the stress-controlled dynamic triaxial test method on the measured sample response. The soil model employed in the developed method of dynamic analysis uses a set of nested yield surfaces to represent shear stress-strain behaviour. These yield surfaces are defined by von Mises failure criterion, have an associated flow rule and undergo both kinematic and isotropic hardening. An empirical model is used to calculate the rise in pore pressure due to cyclic shear stresses. The changes in yield surface radii and hardening constants are defined by experimentally determined relationships between maximum shear modulus, shear strength and mean effective confining stress. A combination of critical state soil mechanics and volumetric considerations is used to relate increments in mean strain to increments in mean stress. The soil structure is divided into elements and a finite difference scheme used to solve the equations of motion. An energy transmitting boundary is incorporated in the analysis. The program has the capacity to analyse the dynamic response of a soil structure to both shear and compression waves approaching the base of the structure from any angle. The dam constructed for the Patea hydroelectric scheme was used as a practical application of the computer program. An input earthquake record considered appropriate to the site was chosen. The dynamic analysis of the dam with an empty reservoir indicated that in this state the dam can satisfactorily withstand the design earthquake. The dynamic analysis of the dam with a full reservoir subject to the same uniform base excitation suggests that a slide in the downstream shoulder would develop. The input earthquake waves travelling along the base of the dam from the upstream toe to the downstream toe, accentuate these displacements. These displacements are caused by the generation of high pore pressures which redistribute after the earthquake to temporarily reduce the stability of the dam further. The assumptions and approximations inherent in the method of analysis tend to make the results pessimistic. It was found that the vertical component of earthquake excitation was the major cause of the generated pore pressure. The results of an extensive programme of laboratory tests carried out on the main construction material in the dam, are presented. The test programme consisted of undrained triaxial, isotropic consolidation, free vibration torsion and stress controlled dynamic triaxial tests. Factors influencing the pore pressure generation characteristics obtained from the stress-controlled dynamic triaxial tests, were found to include the compacted dry density, the cyclic shear stress, the initial effective confining stress, the test frequency, the method of sample compaction, the use of filter paper side drains and the type of end platen.</field><field name="date">1983</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290800 Civil Engineering::290801 Structural engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2192</field></doc><doc><field name="title">In-situ mechanical behaviour of Huntly coal</field><field name="creator">Mills, K.

Laboratory tests on core specimens and small scale in-situ pressuremeter testing are used to determine elastic properties and failure criteria of the coal and coal measure rocks. The in-situ stress field that exists in the Waikato basin and in particular in the Test Panel of the No 1 West Mine is determined. An instrument is developed especially to measure in-situ stress in coal. To check in-situ behaviour of the coal seam, a full scale underground roadway is excavated in the Test Panel. Stress changes and deformations are monitored from nearby drives allowing all the changes to be observed, even those that are normally missed because they occur ahead of excavation. Using elastic properties and in-situ stresses determined from small scale tests, the roadway excavation is mathematically modelled using the finite element technique. Stress changes and deformations thus calculated are compared to those measured in the full scale test. With evidence gained in the Test Panel investigation, general observations of tunnel behaviour elsewhere in the mine are investigated. Some problems that have beset the mine are identified and solutions are found.</field><field name="date">1985</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290800 Civil Engineering::290805 Geotechnical engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2210</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Karikari plutonics of Northland, New Zealand: the petrology of an arc-type intrusion and its envelope</field><field name="creator">Ruddock, Richard Sean</field><field name="description">The Karikari Plutonics are Early Miocene in age and consist of two plutonic bodies, with age relations delineated by cross- cutting relationships, and associated later stage dykes. The older pluton is a complex body exhibiting textural variability, cumulate-style crystallisation, varied enclaves (indicating complex magma chamber processes including convection and crystallisation along steeply-dipping northwest oriented fronts) and a multi-phase structural and dyke intrusion history. Modal analysis shows this body to be diorite to quartz monzodiorite, and geochemically calc-alkaline and medium-K in nature. In contrast the younger pluton is extremely homogeneous and intruded by a single, volumetrically sparse, dyke phase. Modally quartz monzonite to granite (adamellite), and high-K calc- alkaline, this body has higher Si, K-group + Na, REE group and HFSE group elements than the older pluton. Mineral differences are confined to An contents in plagioclase, En values in orthopyroxenes and a wider range of Al in younger pluton hornblendes. Igneous differentiation can be modelled within the older pluton and between the older and younger bodies, by fractional crystallisation dominated by plagioclase, with subordinate ortho- and clino- pyroxene and oxide phases. The dykes show a compositional range from basaltic andesite to dacite, with andesite volumetrically dominant. A temporal trend can be seen with younger dykes becoming more felsic and of greater volume, and changing orientation from northeast to northwest. Two subdivisions can be made based on the presence or absence of hornblende. Pyroxene only dykes are mostly medium-K and dominantly andesitic, whereas hornblende-bearing lithologies are both medium-K and high-K, are andesite and dacite, and appear to be more evolved chemically. The rock envelope into which the Karikari Plutonics was intruded consists of Cretaceousage basalts, rhyolites and sedimentary lithologies. Although a regular contact aureole is not exposed, the lowest grade of contact metamorphism is delineated by the first occurrence of biotite. Rocks equivalent to the hornblende hornfels facies are widespread and rare pyroxene hornfels are found adjacent to contacts. Alteration and veining, particularly prevalent in fault/shear zones, and the presence of a magmatic-hydrothermal type breccia are evidence for a hydrothermal system associated with the waning stages of Lower Miocene-age igneous activity on the Karikari Peninsula. Fluid inclusion and stable isotope data indicates the presence of fluids of both magmatic and meteoric origin. The Karikari Plutonics are correlated with the arc-type regional association of Northland and the Coromandel Peninsula. The source of these rocks is broadly M-type, hydrous and involving subduction zone, and modified mantle wedge components, but with some unspecified crustal involvement indicated by Sr isotopes. Specifically this source is modelled, for the Karikari Plutonics, as having LREE enriched 2x relative to HREE and partially melting (&lt; 15% of the source) at the base of the crust (&#8805;30 km). These melts gave rise to the arc-type association either erupting at the surface, or ponding in upper crustal (&#8804;10 km) magma chambers.</field><field name="date">1990</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::260000 Earth Sciences::260100 Geology::260105 Petroleum geology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2207</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Non-commensurate realization of compact broadband R.F. Circuits</field><field name="creator">Blomfield, Douglas Arthur Edmonds</field><field name="description">A new method for the synthesis of broadband impedance transformers having predictable passband frequency response is presented. The technique is based on the use of non-commensurate (i.e. unequal element length) transmission line networks. Through the use of approximations and computer optimization studies non-commensurate circuits are shown to be advantageous in distributed circuit design. The new method derives a non-commensurate circuit from a conventional commensurate prototype in such a way that the transmission matrix of pairs of elements in both circuits is made equal at one frequency. The transformation used ensures that the frequency response of the derived circuit closely matches that of the prototype circuit. Limitations on section characteristic impedances imposed either by constructional constraints or other practical realizability considerations are more easily met using the new design technique than when using conventional commensurate networks alone, Moreover, wide harmonically related passbands are largely avoided. The method finds greatest application where there are circuit length (or size) restrictions which must be met. Where such restrictions do not apply, conventional commensurate techniques are usually sufficiently flexible. The non-commensurate technique can however still provide benefits of even greater flexibility or better stop-band attenuation. The method presented is only an approximate equivalence and so an analysis of the technique is presented. The analysis establishes the degree of approximation. The use and application of the non-commensurate design technique are supported by an experimental investigation.</field><field name="date">1983</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290900 Electrical and Electronic Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2179</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ethylene Biosynthetic Genes in Actinidia Chinensis</field><field name="creator">Whittaker, David J.</field><field name="description">Actinidia chinensis, a diploid relative of kiwifruit, has valuable fruit characteristics, and varieties with superior flavour and marketable size have recently been selected in a classical breeding programme. However, the marketability of the fruit of A. chinensis and many other species of Actinidia is limited by poor fruit storage properties. Pioneering work in tomato has demonstrated that fruit ripening and senescence can be very effectively delayed by down-regulating genes required for biosynthesis of the phytohormone ethylene. The goal of this work was to isolate genes for ethylene biosynthesis in A. chinensis, characterise their expression, and to generate transgenic plants containing T-DNA constructs designed for ethylene downregulation. A small cDNA library was constructed from RNA isolated from the ripe fruit of A. chinensis. The library was screened for genes encoding each of the enzymes in the ethylene biosynthetic pathway, by probing with PCR products amplified from kiwifruit cDNA and with a cDNA clone previously isolated from kiwifruit. Three distinct cDNA clones encoding S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) synthetase (ACSAM1, ACSAM2 and ACSAM3) were isolated from the library, together with two distinct 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) oxidase cDNA clones (ACAO1 and ACAO2). No ACC synthase cDNAs were detected in the library, indicating low transcript abundance. However, a partial ACC synthase cDNA (ACAS1) was amplified from ripe fruit using PCR techniques, and subsequently cloned in a plasmid vector. Phylogenetic analysis of SAM synthetase protein sequences from A. chinensis and other plant species indicates bifurcation of angiosperm SAM synthetase sequences into two main branches; ACSAM3 was assigned to a different branch from ACSAM1 and ACSAM2. The peptide sequence of ACAS1 shows higher homology to several auxin-inducible ACC synthase peptides than the product of the ethylene-inducible ACC synthase gene which is predominantly transcribed in ripening tomato fruit. RNAse protection assays were employed to estimate the relative transcript levels of each of the ethylene biosynthetic genes isolated from A. chinensis during ethylene-induced, post-harvest fruit ripening, and in immature fruit and floral samples. The response of the mature fruit to exogenous ethylene indicated a clear separation of ethylene sensitivity and ethylene production in A. chinensis. The application of exogenous ethylene correlated with increased transcript levels for all three SAM synthetase genes (ACSAM1, ACSAM2 and ACSAM3) and for the ACC oxidase gene family. Transcription of the ACC synthase gene ACAS1 was not affected by exogenous ethylene, but transcript levels increased during subsequent ethylene biosynthesis, consistent with this being a controlling step for the onset of ethylene production. One or more ACC oxidase transcripts increased significantly both prior to and during ethylene production. Only one of the SAM synthetase transcripts (ACSAM3) was induced during the late ethylene burst, and these transcripts were also abundant in floral tissues and young fruit. A role for SAM synthetase genes in the methionine salvage pathway is discussed. The expression patterns for ACAS1 and the ACC oxidase gene family arc consistent with the consensus view that the rate of ethylene biosynthesis in plant tissues is dependent on both ACC synthase and ACC oxidase activity levels. Therefore, with the aim of down-regulating ethylene biosynthesis in A. chinensis, expression cassettes containing ACAS1 and ACAO1 cDNAs, each controlled by a d35S promoter, were inserted in tandem into the Agrobacterium binary vector pCGN1549, in both the sense and antisense orientations. Leaf tissue from the &#8216;Earligold&#8217; variety of A. chinensis was transformed with the resulting binary vectors, and transgenic plants were regenerated. PCR and Southern analysis indicated intact T-DNAs were integrated in at least half of the transformed plants, and Northern analysis detected mRNAs from one of the transgenes transcribed from both the sense and antisense constructs. No decrease in wound-induced ethylene biosynthesis was detected in the leaves of a small sample of these transgenic plants, and a larger number of transformants are now being grown for phenotypic screening. Down-regulation of ethylene biosynthesis may improve the storage properties and/or the shelf life of transgenic A. chinensis plants and may provide insights into the roles of ethylene in fruit ripening.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270400 Botany</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2169</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies of dichloro- and tetrachloro- adducts of naphthalene and some of its substituted derivatives</field><field name="creator">Burton, Graham William</field><field name="description">trans-1,2-Dichloro-1,2-dihydronaphthalene has been obtained as the major product of the photochlorination of naphthalene at low temperature, and is the first authentically described naphthalene dichloride. Its further reaction with chlorine, under heterolytic conditions gives, in part, a new naphthalene tetrachloride, whose configuration has been assigned, by 1H n.m.r., as being that of the r-1,c-2,c-3,t-4-isomer. The assigned configuration and conformation of the compound are confirmed by its behaviour on alkaline dehydrochlorination, which gives mainly trans-1,2,4-trichloro-1,2-dihydronaphthalene as an intermediate. The naphthalene dichloride, and its 4-chloro-derivative, have been found to undergo solvolysis in methanol - acetone (4:1), and it is further found that heterolysis of the carbon-chlorine bond at C- 2 is strongly favoured, leading largely to the 1-chloro-substituted elimination product. The former dichloride also gives a small amount of 1-methoxynaphthalene, which is possibly derived by unimolecular substitution at the 1-position. The presence of a chlorine atom at the 3-position of the structure is found to inhibit the solvolytic reaction. Bimolecular syn-elimination in these compounds is accelerated by the presence of additional chlorine substituents, and the increasing preference shown for attack at H- 2, which is further accentuated by the use of the powerfully basic reagent, potassium t-butoxide in t-butanol-dimethylsulphoxide (1:4), is interpreted as indicating a transition state tending toward the E1cB- like side of the E2 spectrum of transition states. The naphthalene tetrachlorides, and some derivatives, have been found to undergo aluminium trichloride-catalysed epimerization at the benzylic centres, which yields information on the relative thermodynamic stabilities of isomers with identical relative configurations at C- 2 and C- 3, and can also be of synthetic value. The photochlorination of 1-chloronaphthalene in CC14 at room temperature proceeds analogously with the reaction of naphthalene under the same conditions, giving five new tetrachlorides, four of which have been thoroughly characterized. The presence, in some tetrachlorides, of inter-ring non-bonded compressions between adjacent chlorines has been found to cause significant changes in the geometry of the alicylic ring, causing a tendency for the half-boat conformation to be adopted, provided this does not lead to 1,4-diaxially related chlorines. The strain present in these compounds is manifested by their very marked tendency to undergo isomerization in the presence of aluminium trichloride, and greatly increased rates of alkaline dehydrochlorination. The chlorination of l,5-dichloronaphthalene in chloroform, or dichloromethane, has been studied and has been found to be markedly catalysed by traces of iodine. The products are almost wholly derived by addition of chlorine in the first stage, and this has been interpreted as arising from a steric inhibition of proton-loss by the adjacent peri-chlorine.</field><field name="date">1973</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2170</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Aspects of heat transfer to particles in thermal plasma processing</field><field name="creator">Wu, Murray Kelvin</field><field name="description">Thermal plasma technology is potentially useful for a range of materials processing applications, such as the synthesis of sub-micron, ultra-pure ceramic powders. Thermal plasma reactors are characterised by short residence times (between 10 and 100 ms). Consequently, for chemical reactions to proceed to completion, reactants must be in the gas phase. Reaction rates of solids and liquids are too slow to proceed to any great degree in a thermal plasma, and unvaporised particles can contaminate product material. However, many useful reagents for plasma synthesis are available in particulate form, and thus particles must be completely vaporised if they are to be effective. In this thesis, vaporisation of particles in thermal plasmas was investigated both numerically and experimentally. A numerical model of particle vaporisation in a thermal plasma was developed, which considers the effects of particle vapour on thermodynamic and transport properties of the plasma. This was compared with a simpler model which neglects vapour contamination effects on the plasma. Results showed that the simpler model greatly over-estimated vaporisation times of copper, aluminium, and tungsten particles in argon plasmas at temperatures less than 11000 K, but reasonable accuracy was obtained at higher temperatures. It was found that heat and mass fluxes, and vaporisation time could be expressed in a reduced form which is independent of initial particle diameter. Heat and mass fluxes during vaporisation were found to be linear functions of the inverse of particle radius. Gas-vapour property data are generally difficult to obtain, and guidelines are recommended for using pure argon properties to estimate vaporisation time. The two major types of thermal plasma are the DC (direct current) arc, and the RF (radio-frequency), or induction, plasma. The RF plasma has several advantages over other techniques for the synthesis of powders. Reactions occur in primarily in the gas phase, resulting in good mixing between reactants. Rapid quenching of the tail flame can be used to promote homogeneous nucleation and fine particle size. There is no source of external contamination, because the RF plasma torch lacks electrodes, and a wide variety of reactants can be used, including corrosive and oxidising reagents. The plasma has a relatively low velocity and large diameter, and axial feeding of particles results in better vaporisation of particulate reagents than other thermal plasma torches. In the experimental programme, two RF plasma torches were designed and constructed using the same 13.5 MHz, 15 kW power supply. Fluidised bed feeders and a vibratory feeder were constructed to feed low flow rates (less than 0.2 g/min) of powders, and other apparatus were designed for collecting product particles and quenching the plasma tail flame. The final torch design was used to study heat transfer to particles of a range of materials and particle sizes in the plasma. The materials studied covered a range of boiling points and heats of vaporisation, so that the effects of these properties could be investigated. Particles of alumina, titanium carbide and magnesium oxide smaller than 38 &#956;m diameter were found to vaporise completely. Condensation of vapour produced particles approximately 100 nm diameter which were probably agglomerates of smaller particles formed by homogeneous nucleation. Inspection of morphologies of unvaporised particles showed that the treatment of particles in the plasma is not always uniform, as particles follow a wide range of trajectories and experience various temperature histories. From a semi-empirical analysis of partial vaporization of a range of particle sizes it was estimated that the mean residence time of particles was 18 ms and the mean plasma temperature was 9400 K A heat transfer coefficient of 8000 W/m2K was estimated for partially vaporising particles, which was similar to heat transfer coefficients obtained by numerical modelling. These three parameters may be used to predict the degree of vaporization of particles in an RF plasma torch. Thermodynamic analyses of plasma synthesis of titanium carbide and nitride were performed, indicating the feasibility of the synthesis of these materials in thermal plasma reactors and possible reactant combinations which may be used.</field><field name="date">1991</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::291400 Materials Engineering::291404 Ceramics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2193</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modelling of a pinched sluice concentrator</field><field name="creator">Subasinghe, G.

Although the initial goal of the reforms was to improve the nation's economy, changes soon took place across other fields ranging from politics to culture, from society to the legal system. These changes throughout the 1980s and 1990s had a significant impact on the development of Chinese film. Contemporary Chinese films reflect these changes either directly or indirectly. This thesis studies the development of film in post-Cultural Revolution China to the mid-1990s. The thesis argues that Chinese film experienced a shift of cultural identity from being subject to Chinese tradition to submitting to transnational globalism. The causes of this shift were a combination of China's own reform process and international cultural and financial involvement in the Chinese film industry. In light of some Western cultural theories, such as structuralism, post-structuralism (including deconstruction), psycho-analysis and postmodernism, this thesis examines a series of acclaimed Chinese directors and films. Many of these directors and films are internationally well known either for their cinematic achievements or for the political controversies about their films. They are seen as representative, especially when contemporary Chinese film is assessed from a cross-cultural, global perspective. In a new millennium Chinese cultural policies on film production and censorship are changing. This thesis summarizes how the Chinese film industry in the last two decades has responded to, and from time to time accelerated the country's modernization, commercialization and internationalisation.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420300 Cultural Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2178</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Risk factors for motorcycle injury: the role of age, gender, experience, training and alcohol</field><field name="creator">Mullin, Bernadette Therese</field><field name="description">Introduction: Motorcyclists in New Zealand suffer a disproportionate number of road traffic crashes. In 1995, 2% of all registered vehicles in NZ were motorcycles, but 9% of reported injuries and 13% of all fatalities were in motorcycle riders. Generally there is a lack of good evidence about many postulated risk factors, with previous studies reporting inconsistent findings. Aim: To identify the role of age, gender, experience, training and alcohol consumption as risk factors for moderate to fatal injury resulting from a motorcycle crash. These factors were chosen because they are the subject of current policy debate in New Zealand. Methods: A population-based case-control study was conducted in the Auckland region over a three year period from Feb 1993. The study base was defined as motorcycles being ridden on non-residential public roads of the Auckland region over a three year period between the 15th of February 1993 and the 14th of February 1996 between 6am and midnight. A case was defined as a motorcycle crash occurring within the study base in which either or both the motorcycle driver or pillion passenger met the injury criteria: were admitted to a public hospital within Auckland; were treated in the Public Hospital Emergency Department in the region with an Injury Severity Score of 5 or greater; or died as a result of a motorcycle crash. The aim was to identify all cases using comprehensive case finding procedures included surveillance of emergency departments, the Coroner's office and injury crashes reported to the Police. Controls, or the sample of the study base, were identified from roadside surveys which were conducted at random times from 150 random sites chosen from non-residential roads. Each road was sampled in proportion to its total length. This produced a random sample of motorcycle riding from the study base. If possible, the motorcyclist was stopped at the survey site. If this was not possible, they were identified by following up their registration plate number. Interviewer-administered questionnaires were used, either face-to-face or by telephone, to obtain exposure data. Objective alcohol data were also obtained from blood and breathalyser tests. Results: Information was obtained on 477 cases and 1518 controls, with interviews completed for 94.5% of case drivers and 81.2% of control drivers. Motorcyclists aged 25 years and over had the lowest risk of moderate to fatal injury from a motorcycle crash when compared to drivers aged from 15 to 19 years (adjusted RR=0.45, 95%Cl=0.33-0.62); the risk for 20 to 24 year olds was intermediate (adjusted RR=0.72, 95%Cl=0.52-1.00). There was insufficient evidence from this study to assess whether there was a changing pattern of risk for motorcycle riders aged over 50 years. The population attributable risk for 15 to 16 year olds in this study was only 0.72%. There was no evidence of an association between gender and risk, indicating that most motorcycle injuries occur in males because most motorcycle riding is done by males. Motorcyclists with more than five years of regular on-road motorcycle riding experience were associated with some increased risk compared to those with less than two years (adjusted RR=1.57, 95%Cl=0.96-2.58), particularly among the 20 to 24 year age group. Motorcyclists who had ridden their motorcycle 10,000 kilometres or more had a lower risk compared to those who had ridden less than 1000 kilometres (adjusted RR=0.52, 95%Cl=0.35-0.79). There was no clear effect observed for other measures of experience including off-road motorcycle riding, other motor vehicle driving and familiarity with the road. There was some evidence that motorcyclists who had attended motorcycle training were at lower risk (adjusted RR=0.74, 95%Cl=0.49-1.14), but the precision of this estimate was poor. There was less clear evidence of an association with recent non-motorcycle training and risk. Motorcyclists who reported having consumed alcohol within 12 hours were at higher risk (adjusted RR=1.53, 95%Cl=1.05-2.23) with a population attributable risk of 11%. Discussion: The methods used in this study to identify and sample the study base by obtaining a random sample of motorcycle riding are likely to have provided a valid estimate of the risks associated with the exposures measured. However some limitations of the study design include the general reliance on self-reported measures of exposures, the lack of data collected on other motor vehicles on the road and the poor quality of data available on alcohol and other environmental factors. This study has identified the following groups of motorcyclists to be at increased risk of moderate to fatal injury: riders aged less than 20 years, riders with more than five years of riding, riders who have not undertaken a motorcycle training course, riders who have ridden less than 1000 kilometres on their current motorcycle and those who have recently consumed any alcohol. Given these results, combined with the information obtained from the systematic literature review, the provisions of the Graduated Drivers Licensing System should be reviewed. This should include consideration of basing restrictions for riding primarily on the age rather than the experience of the motorcyclist and the completion of specific motorcycle training courses only, rather than a training course for any motor vehicle. Further research should consider some of the shortcomings of this study that have been outlined above and also consider methods of increasing the proportion of female riders and older riders in research. The limited evidence of benefit from motorcycle training courses, while encouraging, indicates that further investigation of their benefit in controlled trials is required.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321200 Public Health and Health Services::321214 Health and community services</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2182</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The fatigue of prestressed concrete beams under reversed cyclic loading</field><field name="creator">Jacobs, M. L. (Murray Lionel)</field><field name="description">This thesis reports investigations into the stiffness of and energy loss in two series of prestressed concrete beams subjected to reversing sinusoidal cyclic end rotations of equal magnitude and direction. These rotations produced equal moments at the ends of the beams and zero moment at the centre which led to uniform shear along the length of the member. Special care was taken in the manufacture of the two series of beams to ensure essential uniformity of the properties of the beams one to another. The end rotations and the resulting moments where measured by suitable transducers and traces of the moment versus rotation relationship were recorded on an X-Y recorder at intervals during each test run. The amplitude of rotation was progressively changed during each test to ensure a steady value of the end moments. From these recordings the changes in end stiffness and energy absorption were observed and recorded against the number of cycles of moment applied. Concrete strains near the ends of the beams were recorded during the tests. The end moments were expressed as a percentage of the &#8220;ultimate&#8221; moment which would be required to fail the beams in one reverse cycle of loading. The moment rotation properties of the beams were observed to change as the number of cycles of loading were increased, this change being more rapid for higher percentages of &#8220;ultimate&#8221; moment. The energy dissipation was found to increase with an increase in the frequency of the cyclic loading, It was considered that the greater part of the energy dissipation arose from the material damping within the concrete. At higher percentages of ultimate moment, the number of cycles sustained before failure was found to increase when ties were inserted around the reinforcing wires. The results from the tests were analysed and an attempt made to relate the properties by the beans to the properties of the component materials of the prestressed members. A theoretical model was postulated with certain simplifications of the relationships of the material properties and a computer program designed to simulate qualitatively, the behaviour of the beams tested. A non-linear hysteretic stress-strain relationship was assumed for the concrete in this analysis which gave similar stress-strain traces to these found in the experimental analysis.</field><field name="date">1968</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2256</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Auckland heart study: a case-control study of coronary heart disease</field><field name="creator">Jackson, Rodney T.</field><field name="description">Coronary heart disease is the leading cause of death and a major cause of morbidity in New Zealand. Although the mortality rates are now declining, they remain high by international standards and there is considerable scope for the prevention of coronary heart disease. There is a paucity of New Zealand data on the aetiology of this disease. The Auckland Heart Study is a case-control study of coronary heart disease which was designed to determine whether a range of variables including; smoking, passive smoking, hypertension, exercise, alcohol, serum lipids, and dietary and psychosocial factors, are related to coronary heart disease in New Zealand. Other factors examined included respiratory infection, sex hormones and serum vitamins. The study also documented the prevalence of the major risk factors in the Auckland adult population so as to examine trends in risk factors since the 1982 Auckland Risk Factor Study. The study was conducted between 1 March 1986 and 3 May 1988. There were two case groups: non fatal myocardial infarction cases and coronary death cases; and two control groups: myocardial infarction controls and coronary death controls.

Simulations were performed using CFX-5, an unstructured commercial CFD package. The research focuses on the performance of the SST and k-&#969; turbulence models which were judged to be CFX-5's most appropriate turbulence models for downwind sail flows. Two-equation turbulence models are viewed as the most appropriate model type for sail simulations, they capture a significant amount of the flow physics whilst providing turnaround times for sail simulations of less than one day. CFD simulations were compared with experimental data for a flat plate at shallow angles of incidence. This test case holds particular relevance to sail flows since both flows are affected by leading edge separation bubbles which form due to knife-edge separation at sharp leading edges. The CFD captures this leading edge bubble well, with the SST model predicting the length of the bubble with 7% of the experimental value. Wind tunnel data was gathered for two-dimensional downwind sail sections for the purpose of CFD validation. A preliminary wind tunnel study was carried out using a low aspect ratio model. The tests were prone to three-dimensional effects and only three-dimensional CFD simulations were capable of successfully reproducing the flow. High aspect ratio wind tunnel test results were also conducted in an effort to obtain nominally two-dimensional wind tunnel data. Surface pressures were measured using Pressure Sensitive Paint (PSP), however due to the low dynamic pressure of the tests error appeared in the data and comparison with the CFD was poor Results show that CFD is capable of qualitatively reproducing downwind sail flows, the leading and trailing edge separation regions were captured and the CFD results compared well with wind tunnel flow visualization. Finally, CFD simulations were used to investigate the two-dimensional downwind sail design space through a parametric study of sail draft and camber. Results show that increasing camber increases both lift and drag a trend that also is evident in three-dimensional sail designs. It is also shown that gains can be made by using designs with draft values as far aft as 60% which helps reduce the extent of trailing edge separation. This parametric design study illustrates how CFD can be used successfully to analyse design trends and rank designs. The research presented illustrates how CFD can be used in the design process but also that care must be made in validating the method. Through this study the relative strengths and weaknesses of the turbulence models are better understood. Whilst CFD cannot yet be reliably used for downwind sail performance prediction, it is still a useful tool for investigating the flow structure which leads to better understanding of the design space.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290500 Mechanical and Industrial Engineering::290501 Mechanical engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2181</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Scattering of polarized neutrons from light nuclei</field><field name="creator">Garrett, Ross.</field><field name="description">Introduction: In this chapter the present status of our understanding of the interaction of five and fewer nucleons will be briefly summarized. Some of the gaps in our knowledge will be pointed out, making clear the motivation for the experimental work described in the remainder of the thesis. Since most of the experimental effort by the author has been directed towards scattering of neutrons by protons, the nucleon - nucleon problem will be considered in greater detail. In speaking of this, the simplest problem in nuclear physics, M.L. Goldberger made the following remarks at the 1960 Midwest Conference on Theoretical Physics: "There are few problems in modern theoretical physics which have attracted more attention than that of trying to determine the fundamental interaction between two nucleons. It is also true that scarcely ever has the world of physics owed so little to so many .. . . . . . In general, in surveying the field, one is oppressed by the unbelievable confusion and conflict that exists.

Defining emotional child abuse (ECA) is an area of debate in the literature and a widely recognised definition has yet to be developed. There is general agreement on the definition of resilience with most making reference to adapting and coping well in the face of adversity. Recent research has questioned the implied unidimensionality of the term. A research study was designed with several aims: to explore how ECA is defined by professionals working in the area of child abuse, and by members of the general public; to develop an understanding of the nature of ECA from adults who self-identified as having experienced ECA; and, to examine the ways in which these adults coped, and dealt with ECA and its effects. Further aims of the research following from these were to develop a definition of ECA, and to identify implications for practice for those working in the area of ECA. Attachment theory (Bowlby, 1969, 1988; Crittenden &amp; Ainsworth, 1989) was the theoretical base for the research. The literature on resilience was reviewed with a particular focus on ECA. Consistent findings in the literature on the cost of resiliency in the area of emotional well-being and functioning were explored and used to critically examine the clinical utility of the term. Two surveys were developed, one for distribution to all the professionals working in the area of child abuse in statutory agencies in Auckland; and one for distribution to a sample of adults living in the greater Auckland area. Comparison of the conceptual and specific categories derived from the definitions of ECA provided by the professional group (N=l8l) and the lay group (N=142) indicated considerable agreement. Differences between the groups on the relative frequency of use of the categories were explained and directions for future research were suggested. Concurrence between the findings of this study and others on developing a definition of ECA supported the existence of ECA as a separate and consistent form of child maltreatment. Adults who saw themselves as having experienced ECA were identified through the general public and professional surveys (N=30). They were individually interviewed using a semi-structured format about the nature of the ECA they had experienced and how they had coped with it as a child, adolescent, and adult. The interviews, and relevant material from the surveys, were analysed using a Grounded Theory approach. The themes that emerged from the material on the nature of ECA were grouped into four areas: the nature of ECA; the effects of ECA; the context of ECA; and, disclosure of ECA. The themes that emerged on how participants coped and dealt with the ECA they had experienced revealed a range of coping strategies and changes in these across the broad developmental stages of childhood, adolescence, and adulthood. An important distinction that emerged was that between coping with the ECA and dealing with it. The cost of coping was a prominent theme and concurred with findings in the literature. The implications for practice and directions for future research generated by these findings are discussed. A theoretical definition developed from the research findings is presented and applied to specific examples from the research.</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology::380106 Developmental psychology and ageing</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2201</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An electrostatic particle accelerator</field><field name="creator">Naylor, Henry</field><field name="description">Introduction: This thesis is an account of the design, construction and testing of a particle accelerator which represents a minor variation on the now-familiar theme of the tandem van de Graaff.

It argues that under-achievement is framed within boundaries of changing recognitions and realisations of power and difference: that conceptions of difference have influenced education policy and schooling practices for Maori. Theoretically, the thesis examines 'what counts as difference' and 'what differences count'. In recognising that unequal power relations between dominant and subordinate groups produce distinct views about difference, 'what counts as difference' encompasses the perspectives of dominant groups and 'what differences count', subordinate groups. The former view is developed to expand the basis for investigating 'Pakeha conceptions of difference', and the latter, 'Maori conceptions'. The thesis traces the interactions and relationships of 'difference' and 'power', and examines, historically, how they have contributed to and sustained Maori educational under-achievement. The contribution of these conceptions of difference to informing schooling practices is investigated through four sequential 'Classification Schemes' of Assimilation, Integration, Multiculturalism and Biculturalism. The thesis argues that Biculturalism is based on a positive view of Maori cultural differences, and examines the extent of Maori influence on four recent education policy making processes. The thesis also acknowledges a Maori focus on the importance of structural differences for addressing their needs. On the basis of those two different perspectives, the thesis develops the concepts 'Maori-friendly' and 'Maori-centred', to examine processes, and structures and the relative influence of Maori on mainstream policy forming processes. The thesis shows that Tomorrow's Schools, Education for the Twenty-First Century and the Maori Affairs Select Committee Inquiry encapsulate different degrees of both Maori-friendly and Maori-centred approaches, though arguing that ultimately, it is Pakeha conceptions of difference that inform and influence all the policy forming processes. However, the fourth policy process examined was originally a wholly Maori-centred initiative - Te Kohanga Reo. The thesis points to and traces the incorporation of Te Kohanga Reo into the mainstream education system and its consequences for Maori, and concludes that structural differences ensure continuing Pakeha control over Maori conceptions of difference and henceforth Maori educational under-achievement.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420300 Cultural Studies::420306 Maori cultural studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2194</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Rearrangements of N-Halogenoamides</field><field name="creator">Judd, William Paul</field><field name="description">Part I, The Hofmann Rearrangement. First-order rate constants and activation parameters were determined for the rearrangement of eleven N-halogenoamides. The structures of the N-halogenoamides (RCO.NHX) differed in the leaving group (X = chlorine or bromine) and the migrating group (R=ethyl, isopropyl, t-butyl, diphenylmethyl, benzyl, phenyl or p-tolyl). N-Bromoamides and the corresponding N-chloroamides rearranged at similar rates. When the leaving group was changed from bromide to chloride the activation energy was reduced by about one kcal. mole-1 and the activation entropy was reduced by about three cal. deg.-1 mole-1. Differences in the reactivity of halides as leaving groups from carbon and nitrogen are discussed. Changes in the structure of alkyl migrating groups resulted in small irregular changes in the activation parameters. The kinetic data were consistent with a stepwise rearrangement mechanism in which halide departed from nitrogen in the rate-determining step to give a short-lived nitrene intermediate which subsequently rearranged to an isocyanate. Other aspects of the Hofmann rearrangement were investigated. In the Hofmann reaction of amides and hypobromite, N-bromination of the amide was found to be much faster than the rearrangement of the intermediate N-bromoamide conjugate base. In contrast, when amides and hypochlorite reacted in alkaline solution N-chlorination was not fast by comparison with the rearrangement of the intermediate N-chloroamide conjugate base. Oxygen, iodide, and hypobromite did not inhibit the Hofmann rearrangement. Rearrangement of N-brmoacetamide N-bromopropionamide, N-bromoisobutyramide and N-bromopivalamide in the presence of oxygen gave traces of nitrite as a by-product. Nitrite may result from the capture of an intermediate nitrene by oxygen. Ionisation constants of six N-bromoamides and one N-chloroamide were measured. Of the N-halogenoemides which were investigated, the most acidic was N-chloroperfluorobutyramide (pK 2.45) and the least acidic was N-bromopropionamide (pK 7.95). There are no ionisation constants of N-halogenomides recorded in the chemical literature. Part II, The Rearrangement of N-Bromo-&#945;-halogenamides and N-Bromoperhalogenoamides. Previous investigators of the rearrangement concluded that the conjugate base of the N-halogenoamide rearranged intramolecularly via a cyclic four-membered transition state to give an alkyl halide and cyanate ion. This mechanism is incompatible with evidence presented in this thesis. The arrangements of N-bromoperfluorobutyramide and N-bromo-&#945;-chloroisobutyramide in alkaline solution were not first-order reactions. In neutral aqueous solution, the N-halogenoamide conjugate bases did not rearrange. However, in the presence of an excess of hydroxide ion, the N-halogenoamide rearranged readily. The rearrangement was catalysed by hydroxide ion and ammonia and inhibited by many reagents including oxygen, hypobromite, iodide, cupric hydroxide, silver oxide, and amides of carboxylic and sulphonic acids. Possible rearrangement mechanisms are discussed. The effects of small proportions of the inhibitors showed that the rearrangement was a chain reaction. Two probable steps in the chain reaction are the addition of hydroxide ion to the N-halogenoamide conjugate base to give a dianionic intermediate and heterolysis of the nitrogen-bromine bond in this intermediate to give a nitrene. Part III, The Reaction of Mandelamide and Hypohalite. In alkaline solution, mandelamide and hypohalite yield benzaldehyde, cyanate and halide. Several mechanisms which were postulated by previous investigators are excluded by evidence presented in this thesis. Evidence for an N-chloromandelamide intermediate in the reaction of mandelamide and hypochlorite was obtained. Chlorination of mandelamide in neutral or acidic solution gave N-chloromandelamide and N,N-dichloromandelmide. In alkaline solution, the N-chloromandelamides decomposed to give benzaldehyde and cyanate. This reaction was much faster than the reaction of mandelamide and hypochlorite to give the same products. The reactions of hypobromite and hypoiodite with mandelamide were also investigated. Neither oxygen nor an excess of hypobromite inhibited the reaction of mandelamide and hypobromite to give benzaldehyde and cyanate. Hypoiodite (prepared from the reaction of hypochlorite and iodide) and mandelamide also gave benzaldehyde and cyanate in high yield. The mechanism most consistent with the evidence involves the rearrangement of an intermediate N-halogeno-&#945;-hydroxyamide conjugate base to an &#945;-hydroxyalkyl isocyanate which subsequently decomposes to benzaldehyde and cyanate. Mechanisms involving dianionic intermediates were disproved. Stoichiometric similarities in the rearrangements of N-bromo-&#945;-halogenoamides and N-halogeno-&#945;-hydroxyamides were shown to be fortuitous and not the result of similarities in the rearrangement mechanisms. Part IV, Preparation of Amides, N-Bromoamides, and N-Chloroamides. Preparations of amides and N-halogenoamides used in this thesis are described. Some of the N-halogenoamides have not been reported previously. Methods for preparing N-bromo-perhalogenoamides which are described in the chemical literature involve the bromination of the silver salt of the perhalogenoamides in trifluoroacetic acid solution. A much simpler method for preparing N-halogenoperhalogenoamides is described in this thesis.</field><field name="date">1967</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2204</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mechanical wave velocity dispersion in rods and extension of the resonant bar method to 800 KHz: a study of the velocity dispersion of longitudinal waves in rods, and a feasibility study of extending the Resonant Bar method of internal friction measurement to 1 MHz</field><field name="creator">Booker, Rudolf Edward</field><field name="description">The Resonant Bar method for measuring internal friction in solids has been investigated with the aim of extending this method to higher frequencies in the range 100 kHz to 1 MHz.

The velocity dispersion of the lowest longitudinal mode of a rod of square cross-section has proved to be the same as that of a cylindrical rod of the same material, provided the equivalent diameter of the square cross-sectioned rod is taken to be 1.155 times its thickness. The theory of Nigro (1966, 1968) agreed only partially with the experimental velocity dispersion of a square rod (Booker 1969). As a result of this and a recent theory by Fraser (1969), Nigro has modified his theory, so that at present there is perfect agreement between theory and experiment. In cylindrical rods many resonant responses are excited that are not due to the fundamental mode (also called the Young's modulus mode) when the diameter to wavelength ratio becomes appreciable (usually about 0.7). These resonances are attributed to higher order longitudinal modes. Identification of the Young's modulus mode resonances becomes impossible when many of these higher order mode resonances occur. On several occasions one of the expected Young's modulus mode resonances is absent, its place being taken by two or more resonances extremely close together in frequency and of small vibration amplitude. Frequently some of the harmonics have a frequency above or below the expected value, so that they do not lie on a smooth graph of frequency versus harmonic number. It is shown that the above two phenomena occur when the value of &#8486; (= &#969;a/Ct) is close to one of the values &#8486;E, &#8486;1 to &#8486;2, or &#8486;3, where, at a value of: (1) &#8486; = &#8486;E, an end-resonance occurs; (2) &#8486; = &#8486;1, the first complex mode becomes real; (3) &#8486; = &#8486;2, the L(0,2) mode cuts the &#8486; axis on an &#8486; versus koa graph; (4) &#8486; = &#8486;3, the L(0,3) mode cuts the &#8486; axis. To extend the Resonant Bar method to frequencies approaching 1 MHz, it has been found essential to use rods approximately 31/2 inches long and 1/8 th of an inch in diameter. The design and construction of a bar support abstracting a negligible amount of energy from such slender rods proved almost impossible. Both a central three-pin support and a central three-wire support have proved to be unsuitable. A support consisting of two parallel horizontal tungsten wires of a quarter of a thousandth of an inch diameter has however been found to give damping values consistent to within 10%. Graphs are drawn of damping versus frequency for several aluminium and fused silica rods, showing that Q-1 varies but little with frequency and that on the whole it varies smoothly from one harmonic to the next. The Resonant Bar method is ideally suited for the determination of dynamic elastic moduli. A computer program has been developed and used to calculate Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio for any given rod from the resonance frequencies of longitudinal vibration, the dimensions and the mass.</field><field name="date">1969</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2208</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cyclic variability in a natural gas fuelled spark ignition engine</field><field name="creator">Chanchaona, Somchai</field><field name="description">An investigation of cyclic variability in a single-cylinder spark ignition engine fuelled by natural gas was carried out. The effects of combustion chamber shape and compression ratio were examined intensively. Four different combustion chambers were tested and compression ratio was varied in the range of 8.5:1 to 15:1. For each test condition, the in-cylinder pressure data were recorded at each degree of crank angle rotation for a total of two hundred consecutive engine cycles. These pressure-time histories were used for the detailed study of combustion characteristics. The generalized plot of maximum pressure and location at which maximum pressure occurs was demonstrated as an effective means of diagnosing the cyclic variability. It was shown that compression ratio had negligible effect on cyclic variability, but combustion chamber shape had a strong influence. The indicated mean effective pressure proved to be a good index for measuring cyclic variability for a wide range of operating conditions. However, for specific cases in which the variation of indicated mean effective pressure shows poor sensitivity, maximum pressure and maximum rate of pressure rise are useful measures. For high compression ratio engines, a compact combustion chamber arranged around the spark plug has been shown to be superior for reducing cyclic variability. In addition, a study of a model for the small-scale structure of turbulence using the data from these experiments showed good agreement with those from the literature. Alternative assumptions for estimating turbulence length scale were tested and a preferred method is recommended. The study showed that the fast burning combustion chamber is the solution to reduce cyclic variation. However, cyclic variations of maximum pressure and its location in the fast burning condition still exist and continued research to reduce these cyclic variations should concentrate on the variation of characteristics of flame kernel creation and growth from cycle to cycle.</field><field name="date">1990</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290500 Mechanical and Industrial Engineering::290501 Mechanical engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2209</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mechanism of halate-halide reactions</field><field name="creator">Barton, Allan F.

The pollen record indicates that, two thousand years ago, the west Ruapehu forest was dominated by Nothofagus solandri. About 1800 years B.P., the eruption of Lake Taupo devastated the forest. Though Halocarpus spp. and Phyllocladus asplenifolius were important early colonizers, Nothofagus solandri re-established itself close to its present limits after the eruption. Fire, from about 650 years ago onwards, did not affect the beech forest, but did affect the coniferous vegetation on the ring plain near the mountain. The age structure of the forest shows that there was a large disturbance event shortly before 1740. A dieback occurring about 1969 appears to have been the largest episode of mortality since 1740, larger than the dieback episode described by Cockayne at the beginning of this century. Dieback occurred as a short peak-period of Nothofagus solandri death about 1969. It was the large trees of the mature cohort which tended to be killed by dieback rather than the smaller individuals. Tree-ring analysis, showed that narrow tree-rings occurred in beech in the 1960's. Extreme rainfall years in the early 1960's may have put the beech trees under stress, making them susceptible to dieback. The drought in 1969 may have precipitated extensive mortality. The characteristics of N. solandri rings from Ruapehu are similar to ring characteristics of that species from South Island studies. The 1982 cyclone had a noticeable impact on the forest, affecting some areas severely. However, the impact was relatively minor compared to the influence of dieback. The mean density of trees &gt;= 10cm dbh was 520 stems/ha., of which 220 stems/ha. were Nothofagus solandri. The mean basal area was 22m2 /ha., of which 11m2 /ha. was N. solandri. The basal area is very low compared to that in other N.Z. forests. N. solandri, Griselinia littoralis, Phyllocladus asplenifolius, Podocarpus hallii, and Libocedrus bidwillii, made up 35, 22, 16, 9, and 8 percent, respectively, of the total density. Basal area, density, and species composition varied as much within sites, as between them. The shrub layer formed a large part of the vegetation at west Ruapehu. Coprosma species were particularly abundant. There is sufficient regeneration to indicate that a new cohort of N. solandri is becoming established in most areas. Some areas will probably remain in shrubland for many decades. The result of dieback and windthrow has been to virtually eliminate the canopy of large old beech trees, and to increase the heterogeneity of stand structure. N. solandri seedling densities are not as high as those found in many South Island beech forests. Nothofagus solandri is growing faster than are most of the co-existing tree species, and it appears likely that it will continue as the dominant tree species. Implications for forest management are discussed.</field><field name="date">1989</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270400 Botany::270401 Plant systematics, taxonomy and phylogeny</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2206</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Rectangular stock cutting using optimisation</field><field name="creator">Robinson, Timothy Francis</field><field name="description">An original solution method ("Snippy") is developed for the rectangular stock cutting problem, and compared with the commercially available package "OREC" by applying both methods to industrial order books.

Studies of venereal disease in New Zealand have concentrated on issues of morality and on the political and social debates; this thesis focuses on treatment procedures and Health Department campaigns. The thesis explores the role of doctors in relation to venereal disease. While advancements in drug therapy benefited patients, medical authority was undermined by demanding and defaulting patients, inadequate medical education, and a low status of the profession. The medical profession developed epidemiological studies and defined 'at risk' groups in post-war decades. Despite claims to be 'scientific', the assessments were informed by stereotypes which had changed little over time. The thesis evaluates the scope of preventative health campaigns. Defined as a public health issue by the 1920s, venereal disease was seen as an individual responsibility by the 1960s. During this time the use of legislation declined, and education and contact tracing increased. The control of infection was limited owing to financial and administrative problems, defaulters and opposition from doctors. Those deemed most at risk were not reached by government educational campaigns, leaving much to the work of welfare groups and individual doctors. The health campaigns targeted groups like Maori and servicemen. The historiography has tended to overlook Maori, and, when military campaigns are discussed, to focus on females. This thesis attempts to redress the balance. Maori had, at least until the 1950s, different treatment experiences from non-Maori patients, although this did not necessarily imply discrimination. The military did attempt to control servicemen, though each Service had different experiences. This thesis stresses the complexity of the gender issue. There was a change from blaming females for infection in the early twentieth century to increasingly pointing to male responsibility. Despite these changes, even with the concept of individual risk pattern by the 1960s, and the understanding that men could be asymptomatic carriers, women were persistently seen as the 'reservoir'. A gender bias persisted.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321200 Public Health and Health Services::321207 Indigenous health</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2202</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Frying of potato crisps - an investigation aiming at reduction oil content and acrylamide formation</field><field name="creator">Tran, Mai Thu Thi.</field><field name="description">Reducing oil content, minimizing any carcinogenic acrylamide in the high temperature frying process for potato crisps, and producing good products with considerable crispiness and acceptable color were the objectives of this research. Vacuum frying with pre-treatment of potato crisps was investigated as an effective process for oil content reduction. Pre-drying and subsequent dipping (PSSD) in a sugar solution (&#8216;sugar dipping&#8217;) were considered as an advantageous procedure for the treatment of potato crisps before frying in order to reduce oil uptake during frying. Vacuum frying was observed as an excellent process to decrease significantly the acrylamide formation at low temperature frying of potato crisps. In this study, potato crisps were respectively blanched, pre-dried, and dipped in a solution of sugar (23.07 wt %) for two seconds, before vacuum frying at 120oC, 110oC under different vacuum pressures (170mbars, 150mbars, 100mbars and 50mbars in separate experiments). Conventional frying at 180oC was also used as the control to benchmark the reductions in the oil contents and acrylamide formation among various techniques. There was a significant reduction in oil content of the potato crisps observed when the new techniques were applied. The crisps that had been pre-treated and fried with conventional frying have given the result of 30 wt % reduction. The crisps that were fried under vacuum frying achieved greater oil reduction with varying percentages when applying different pretreatments. The lowest oil content was achieved when the potato crisps were fried at 110oC and 150 mbars giving 58 % reduction on the dry basis compared with control samples. There are various advantages of the technique with PSSD as we have discovered: it is simple and can be applied in potato crisp industries in continuous mode in both vacuum and conventional frying systems. The crisps that had been treated with pre-drying and subsequent sugar solution dipping and then fried were crunchier and possibly had better perceived taste to the consumer, due to the small sugar addition. Pre-drying and vacuum frying have all turned out to be excellent techniques to reduce acrylamide formation in potato crisps as we have found in this study. Vacuum frying at 120oC and 150 mbars reduced acrylamide formation by 80 to 85%. The 95% reduction was obtained when the crisps had been pre-dried. Acrylamide was undetectable when crisps were pre-dried and vacuum fried at 110oC, 150 mbars. The crisps with pre-drying subsequent sugar dipping and vacuum fried at low temperature had improved color compared with the control samples, which were produced by conventional frying at high temperatures.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290100 Industrial Biotechnology and Food Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2318</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The solution of the order conditions for general linear methods</field><field name="creator">Heard, Allison</field><field name="description">The introductory chapter in this thesis examines briefly the nature of initial value problems and surveys the main types of methods used for their numerical solution. The general linear formulation of methods, first proposed by J. C. Butcher, is introduced, together with the definition of order for this class of methods. Finally in this chapter, the problem of stiffness and its effect on numerical procedures is considered. Following a review of Butcher's algebraic approach to the theory of Runge-Kutta and general linear methods in Chapter 2, the theory is applied in Chapter 3 to the search for general linear methods of various orders. As in the case of Runge-Kutta methods, the use of so-called simplifying assumptions plays a significant role in the practical determination of general linear methods. From amongst the range of possible numbers of simplifying assumptions, two cases are chosen and investigated in detail. The important question of stability is considered in the final section of Chapter 3. When a general linear method is used to approximate the solution of an initial value problem, special procedures are required to start and finish the integration. Whilst a major part of Chapter 4 is devoted to the determination of these procedures, the problems of the estimation of local truncation error and the implementation of general linear methods are also discussed. Finally, the Appendices contain Algol 60 procedures for the most important of the algorithms developed in the main body of the thesis.</field><field name="date">1978</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::230000 Mathematical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2212</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Towards a theory of the configuration and management of export-dependent land-based value systems: The case of New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Lockhart, James C.</field><field name="description">Land-based industries provide the majority of New Zealand's export earnings. The scale of production in the larger industries accounting for this trade creates significant dependency on export markets. The performance of these industries in the international location, therefore, has a marked influence on the country's prosperity. The process of taking land-based products from pasture to plate encompasses a value system. A value system (depicted as the Z-form Model, overleaf) includes all sequentially aligned organisations through which product flows from the producer to the international consumer. Value systems also include the linkages between adjoining and non-adjoining organisations. The objective of the study was to develop a theory of the configuration and management of export-dependent land-based value systems, supported by case study material drawn from select New Zealand industries. The Z-form Model constituted a framework from which both relevant contributions and shortcomings in the literature were identified. A conjoint approach to theory building, encompassing both theoretical and empirical contributions, was developed. Empirical evidence was then gathered through multiple case studies of the meat and pipfruit industries to augment theory building. Particular attention was paid to empirical processes relating to the generation of wealth and its subsequent distribution. Phenomena observed through case research were reduced into concepts, and the relationships between concepts identified. Concepts and relationships were then presented as an emergent theory in the form of a causal network. Some of the perspectives and behaviours of value systems were supported by the literature, however, many considerations were found to be unique. A theory of the configuration and management of New Zealand's export-dependent value systems is presented. The theory encompasses empirically based value system strategies that serve to enhance wealth generation and wealth distribution. Normative value systems, based on the Z-form Model, that return wealth to organisations in the home-base location are provided. Further opportunities for wealth creation and repatriation are identified.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2229</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Spread spectrum switching: a low noise modulation technique for PWM inverter drives</field><field name="creator">Handley, P. G.</field><field name="description">Three phase AC drives controlling cage induction motors have become widely accepted in industry, but one extant problem with this technology is that of increased acoustic noise emitted from the driven motor. This Thesis addresses the problem of the acoustic noise emitted from motors driven from voltage sourced PWM inverters and proposes a technique - Spread Spectrum Switching - for minimizing its effects. In the course of the work many other issues associated with real-time microprocessor-based PWM have also been advanced: &#8226; efficient microprocessor based PWM waveform generation, &#8226; harmonic analysis of generalized PWM waveforms, &#8226; compensation for the effects of power switch timing delays, and &#8226; compensation for the finite resolution of timers. The Thesis uses a variety of computational and analytical methods, backed by experimental observations, to quantify the improvement gained in each of these areas. Spread spectrum switching is a technique for eliminating the characteristically tonal structure of the acoustic noise emitted from a PWM inverter driven motor. Similar to the concept of spread spectrum communications, spread spectrum switching involves pseudo-randomly varying the instantaneous PWM switching frequency so that the energy of any PWM switching harmonics is dispersed over a wide bandwidth. This energy dispersion effectively eliminates any tonal components from the resultant motor acoustic noise while leaving the overall sound level largely unchanged; spread spectrum switching provides a significant qualitative yet minimal quantitative noise reduction. The PWM generation paradigm used in this Thesis is the recently reported Space Vector Modulation. A novel algorithm for microprocessor based space vector PWM generation is proposed, providing a basis for fast, efficient generation, even when overmodulating - a situation where many algorithms operate significantly more slowly. Furthermore, it is shown that the space vector method inherently generates a near optimum - in terms of motor harmonic loss - PWM waveform. However, when physically realized on a practical inverter such ideal PWM waveform s are corrupted by timing errors associated with both the inverter's power switches, predominantly the lockout time, and the finite resolution of hardware timers. Resolution corrected modulation is proposed for overcoming the problem of finite timer resolution and involves the use of integral feedback to account for any errors between ideal and physically realizable PWM switching times. This technique effectively provides 4 to 5 bits of added resolution to a given timer, allowing accurate waveform generation at low sinewave amplitudes and high switching frequencies using readily available, often microprocessor based, timers. Lockout times cause inverter output voltage errors, with consequent current zero crossing distortion, and a strategy for alleviating this problem is proposed and implemented in both a triangulation and space vector modulator. Two harmonic analysis techniques are proposed for analyzing PWM waveforms. The first technique is suitable for the analysis of regularly sampled PWM waveforms and has been used here to obtain closed form expressions for the harmonics of both space vector and asymmetrical triangulation PWM. These expressions show that PWM harmonics occur as a series of "combs" centered on multiples of the switching frequency. A second technique - the Directional Rotational Transform - is proposed for numerical analysis of general PWM waveforms. This technique uses an equivalent space vector representation of the PWM waveform, yielding the magnitude, phase and sequence (positive or negative) of the harmonics, and is useful in situations where each of the three phase waveforms is different, as in these cases Fourier Transform analysis of a single phase or line voltage only approximates the harmonics actually seen by the motor. The spectra generated using both these techniques compare favourably with those measured experimentally and, for synchronous PWM, those evaluated from Fourier Transforms. The culmination of modulation techniques presented in this Thesis yields a microprocessor based AC inverter drive featuring low acoustic noise emission at but a few kiloHertz switching rates and accurate PWM waveform generation using a single chip, low cost, micro-controller.</field><field name="date">1990</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290900 Electrical and Electronic Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2230</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Tracer testing of geothermal reservoirs</field><field name="creator">Bullivant, David Peter</field><field name="description">A new model is presented to explain the results of tracer tests of reservoirs. The flow field model is two-dimensional and can include multiple wells, background flow and a high permeability fracture of finite length or a barrier of finite length - likely features of a reservoir in fractured rock. The flow field is represented by a complex potential. This enables the accurate calculation of the time for tracer to travel along the streamline linking the release position and the observation well. The shape of the concentration curve measured at the observation well is governed by dispersion. Two types of dispersion are considered &#8211; small scale dispersion and large scale dispersion. Small scale dispersion is due to interaction with the rock matrix and to small scale variations in velocity (not included in the flow field model), in the neighbourhood of a streamline. Large scale dispersion is due to the spread of tracer over streamlines which have different travel times to the observation well and may go to different observation wells. In the literature, small scale dispersion models are used to match the concentration curves for individual wells. Here it is shown that models with differing small scale mechanisms give equally good matches to Wairakei data and that response curves for small scale dispersion and large scale dispersion are similar. This means that the shape of a concentration response curve gives little information about reservoir structure. The important results from a tracer test are whether tracer is detected at each observation well and the travel times to the wells that respond, in conjunction with the locations of the release and production wells. This new approach to analysing tracer tests is used together with the flow field model to deduce the permeability structure and flow field of a simple hypothetical reservoir and of the Wairakei (New Zealand) geothermal reservoir.</field><field name="date">1988</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2234</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Aspects of fermentation and distillation in ethanol production</field><field name="creator">Weeks, M. G.</field><field name="description">The fermentation of sugars from biomass to produce liquid fuels is receiving widespread attention as a renewable source of energy. For such processes to become competitive with current alternatives, technology must be improved to increase the efficiency and productivity of the operation. Using ethanol fermentation by Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast as a model system, two aspects of the process were considered in detail. The first aspect concerned the use of cell recycle in a continuous fermentation. A new technique was developed for the rapid settling of yeast cells in the fermentation medium and involved the addition of dense, inert particles to a yeast suspension at pH 4.5, followed by a rapid change in pH to 8.0 - 9.0. Large flocs formed immediately and settled rapidly, leaving a clear supernatant. Separations of 99.9% were possible, even at yeast concentrations of 50 g/l (dry weight) and increases in settling rate of up to 1600 fold were observed. When the pH was returned to 4.5, the flocs were destroyed. Seeded settling at constant pH was possible although the flocs were smaller, the settling rates were lower and significantly more seed was required. Flocculation was also found to be influenced to a greater extent by certain components in solution. Nickel powder was used extensively in these experiments although several other materials were tested, with ground iron sand showing potential for application on a larger scale. The pH switching technique for seeded settling was used to recycle yeast cells in a semi-continuous fermentation. Application of the technique to this and similar systems is discussed. The factors affecting yeast/inert powder flocculation is discussed and a model is proposed to explain the observed experimental behaviour for flocculation, both at constant pH and with rapid pH switching. The second aspect of ethanol production considered in this thesis was the distillation stage. Equipment and techniques were developed to obtain basic mass transfer information in binary or multi-component systems. A new design of evaporation cell was used to measure the evaporation of ethanol and water mixtures into an air stream in a wind tunnel. This enabled the effect of liquid concentration on evaporation rate to be studied dynamically from batch tests. Radiochemical labelling was used to measure liquid concentrations and proved to be a relatively simple, rapid and precise analytical technique. Coupled with the direct measurement of liquid displacement, precise information on the evaporation loss of both ethanol and water components was obtained. The pure component evaporation data agreed well with literature correlations and, for the binary liquid mixtures, good agreement was found between the experimentally determined mass transfer flux ratios and those predicted from Gilliland's solution to the multi-component gas diffusion equations. The velocity dependence of the overall mass transfer coefficients enabled estimates to be made of the distribution of diffusional resistance between the gas and liquid phases. For the ethanol-water system diffusion was gas film controlled and the overall mass transfer driving forces could best be represented in terms of vapour concentration.</field><field name="date">1983</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2236</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Chronological analysis and simulation of marine biosocial systems</field><field name="creator">Wolfenden, Jean E.</field><field name="description">The logical structure of this thesis demanded a three part presentation. Part I of this thesis provides an historical analysis of global marine ideologies and values, and establishes a framework and justification for the research. The chronological analysis in Part I reveals that humans lived in harmony with the environment throughout most of history. It was not until the twentieth century that technological developments and the burgeoning human population began to take its toll. During the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries disciplines such as astronomy, physics and chemistry became distinct from philosophy. The most recent discipline to develop has been psychology, a science that is barely one hundred years old. In the past, psychological investigation ignored the natural world until in recent years the new paradigm of environmental psychology has emerged. Expanding on the notion of phenomenological psychology, a systems-oriented approach demands a holistic world view in contrast to analysing parts of a system. From this perspective, the present research adopted a biosocial multidisciplinary approach to the study of the human/marine environment interface. Part II is concerned with the theory and method in the study of marine and coastal environments. The theoretical concept of consumer socialisation assumes that learning takes place during interaction with socialisation agents such as family, peers, cultural influences and the media. To test the paradigm of social learning theory in familial (informal) and peer collaborative (formal) circumstances, two research studies were carried out. First, a three generational sample of five families in Auckland, New Zealand, were interviewed to test intergenerational commonalities and differences in social, cultural and economic values pertaining to marine environmental issues. Content analysis supported the notion that mechanisms associated with consumer socialisation theory were evident in the rhetorical constructs of participants. Predictions that environmentally aware parents and grandparents would have children with similar attitudes, and adjacent generations would have more closely aligned attitudes and beliefs than nonadjacent generations, were supported. Further, interactive dialogue resulted in contradictions and coercion, strategies associated with attitude change within the theoretical model of social learning. The second research study investigated the effects of collaborative learning on cognitive development. In contrast to the systemic approach of experiential learning, the traditional lecture format fails to address the student as a total person. Based on this premise, an interactive simulation game with a focus on marine conservation, and the corresponding effects on learning and behaviour, was developed in the present study. Decisions relating to conservation versus economic development of the marine environment were manipulated by the introduction of role-play in the context of the simulation game, which was based on an imaginary island governed by eight ministries. Following rigorous pilot testing, the final version of the simulation game was field tested with one hundred and fifty-four students aged between twelve and fifteen years at three Auckland, New Zealand, high schools. Results revealed first, a significant effect of role-play on decision-making and second, a significant difference between control and experimental groups in correct answers to knowledge-based questionnaires, confirming the effectiveness of peer interaction through simulation as a teaching device. Students began to construct their own cognitive understanding of environmental issues and problems faced by government departments with divergent agendas. Once this point was reached it was not difficult for participants to consider social, economic and environmental factors in terms of real-life situations. The results of both studies are summarised in the final chapter. Findings revealed that socialisation processes are instrumental in developing orientation towards environmental issues. Furthermore, interpersonal communication has the power to alter cognitive structures. Justification for concern about marine environmental protection, and the urgency associated with the development of educational mechanisms, was evident from the results of this research. Implications for future interaction with marine biosocial systems, limitations of the study and directions for further research, are defined in the closing sections of this thesis.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2241</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analysis of the families of variable length self synchronising codes called T-codes</field><field name="creator">Higgie, G. R.</field><field name="description">Studies of the families of variable length self-synchronising T-Codes are presented. The studies use Monte Carlo computer simulations to analyse the synchronising properties of the T-Codes and the relationships between these and their coding efficiency. Software and hardware implementations of the algorithms which are used to support these simulations are documented, and one of the encoding/decoding techniques presented is shown to be capable of operating at very high speed while being simple to implement. This technique is also shown to be applicable to the encoding and decoding of any variable length, exhaustive, instantaneous code. From the results of the simulations it is shown that some T-Codes consistently outperform others in the family with respect to their synchronising properties, and that the best of these codes have an average synchronisation delay of approximately 1.5 codewords. More importantly, it is shown that the T-Codes with the best synchronising performance are also the most efficient when encoding symbols from a specified information source, and that the coding efficiency of these codes is only nominally less than that of an optimal Huffman code generated for the source. A theoretical analysis of the synchronising properties is presented, and this is used to explain the relationships which exist between the average synchronisation delay and coding efficiency. These results are used to demonstrate that it is possible to choose a T-Code which has both the desirable properties of unrivalled synchronising performance and optimal coding efficiency, and guide-lines are given for choosing such a T-Code for a specified information source. This combination of a fast and simple encoding/decoding technique with codes which have unrivalled synchronising performance without sacrificing coding efficiency is offered as a solution to many of the problems normally associated with variable length coding techniques.</field><field name="date">1991</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290900 Electrical and Electronic Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2232</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Radio frequency plasma synthesis of ultrafine titanium carbide powders</field><field name="creator">Stephens, Robert Leslie</field><field name="description">The work reported in this thesis was part of a larger project to evaluate the use thermal plasma processing to synthesise ultrafine TiCx, TiNy, and TiCxNy powders from locally available TiO2, natural gas and NH3. The objectives for the work reported in this thesis were to develop and test the necessary experimental apparatus for a process for synthesis of the ultrafine ceramic powders, and then to investigate the synthesis of ultrafine TiCxOz powders from pigment-grade TiO2 and natural gas using the process that had been developed. The apparatus developed included a powder feeder capable of feeding ultrafine cohesive powders, a RF plasma torch, and powder collection equipment. Feeding cohesive powder at low flow rates with little flow rate variability is recognised as an extremely difficult task. Perhaps as expected, the vibrated elutriated fluidised bed (VEFB) powder feeder that was developed only partially met its design specification as it fed TiO2 agglomerates to the process that were too large to vaporise and react. The poor process repeatability was attributed to the VEFB powder feeder. It was recommended that a Wright system powder feeder be developed to overcome these limitations. The RF power supply required significant modifications before being used for plasma generation, including the addition of silicon-controlled rectifiers for continuously-variable power control and a complete redesign of the grid feedback circuit. The RF plasma torch development took several iterations, and the design used for all experiments performed adequately except for a low tailpiece reactant gas injection velocity which resulted in poor mixing between reactants injected through the tailpiece and the hot flow. The tailpiece injection velocity should be increased to at least 50 m s-1 for future experiments. The powder collection apparatus used for most experiments consisted of a 785 mm long section of 78 mm ID water-cooled stainless steel tube with smaller diameter tubes inserted within the larger tube. The mass collection efficiency of this device was greater than 75%, and was considered sufficient to ensure that statistically representative samples were collected. The experimental programme for the synthesis of ultrafine TiCxOz was centred on a base case set of experimental parameter values, and investigated the process repeatability, the plasma torch power input, the nominal reaction stoichiometry, the natural gas injection location, the tailpiece injection velocity, and the effect of H2 co-injection. Variation of only one parameter in each experiment led to the identification of required process modifications and reaction system parameters for future study. A complex multiphase mixture of four particle types was produced. Ultrafine spherical single-crystal particles ranging from 7 to 25 nm in diameter were almost always observed and were homogeneously nucleated TiO2 or Ti suboxide particles that then grew by liquid droplet coalescence. Ultrafine cuboid or rhomboid single-crystal particles up to 25 nm across parallel faces were almost always observed and were homogenously nucleated TiCxOz particles with x close to 0.99 and z close to 0 that grew by a gas-solid mechanism. Unvaporised single-crystal TiO2 feed particles and largely amorphous free carbon particles ranging from 8 to 40 nm were always observed. The crystallinity of the free carbon particles increased while the extractable content decreased when the natural gas was injected upstream of the plasma. This indicated that the formation mechanism changed from an acetylenic growth mechanism with upstream injection to a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon mechanism with downstream injection. The low mass vaporisation efficiency and mixing patterns meant that TiCxOz was formed unless the process power input was too low. TiO2 to TiCxOz, conversion was largely unaffected by either an increase in the reaction stoichiometry or reactant injection location. Little or no conversion of TiO2 to TiCxOz occurred in experiments performed below the minimum power input, which for this process appeared to be that required to bring all streams entering the process to a bulk temperature of around 4000 K. The major enthalpy demands for this process were heating the Ar flow required for torch operation and the natural gas reactant stream. Future experiments should not use upstream injection of reactant gases so that all available enthalpy transferred from the discharge to the cooler central core can be used for particle vaporisation. The TiCxOz synthesis experiments were modelled using free energy minimisation techniques. It was found that it was important to include all inert gases in the system specification and that the thermodynamic properties of graphite should adequately represent the thermodynamic properties of the free carbon, so the prediction of the onset of free carbon formation should be relatively accurate. The system TiCx-TiNy-TiOz forms a solid solution with complete miscibility at elevated temperatures. However, the phase and atom distributions, and the temperatures at which phase transitions occurred, were relatively unaffected by the inclusion of ideal solution TiCxOz(s,l) in the system specification. It was concluded that slight differences did not warrant the added complexity caused by including the solution phases in the system specification. Analyses of the individual experiments indicated that free carbon formation would be a serious problem, and that the high vapour pressure of TiN(g) around the temperatures at which TiC(s) formation was predicted to occur may have led to the formation of TiCxNyOz(s) with significant nitrogen levels.</field><field name="date">1994</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2244</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Intermetallic phases formed during galfanizing</field><field name="creator">Chen, Zhan Wen</field><field name="description">Galfan (5 wt% Al-Zn plus 0.05 wt% mischmetal or 0.1 wt% Mg) is a coating which in recent years has undergone many industrial studies and trials. The aim with Galfan is to produce a coating which has no intermetallic phases in the coating but this condition is not always achieved. Though it is important, the nature of the intermetallic phases and the mechanisms of their formation and growth during Galfanizing are far from fully understood. The overall objective of this investigation was to identify the intermetallic phases which form and grow during Galfanizing. At 450&#176;C, the formation of the intermetallic phases was in the form of a local outburst and the intermetallic phases then grew in a breakaway morphology. The previously reported structure and composition of the intermetallic phases were found to be either incorrect or incomplete. The intermetallic local outburst was determined to be mainly Fe2Al5-Znx with the outer part next to the eutectic being FeAl3-Znx. The breakaway phase was FeAl3-Znx and another phase next to the interface was Fe2Al3-Znx. The intermetallic growth is characterized by the growth of Fe2Al3-Znx towards the substrate with a &lt;001&gt; growth direction, following a reaction path of &#945; (substrate) - Fe2Al5-Znx - FeAl3-Znx - Galfan (melt). When the dipping temperature was increased, the rates of intermetallic formation and growth were greatly increased. The intermetallic morphology was shown to change from predominantly breakaway at 450&#186;C to predominantly layered at temperatures higher than 490&#186;C resulting from a fast growth of Fe2Al5-Znx. The degree of the preferred orientation of Fe2Al5-Znx, increased at higher dipping temperatures. It was shown that the lattice parameters and therefore the interplanar spacings of Fe2Al5-Znx formed during Galfanizing were dependent on the dipping temperatures. The same reaction path as that described for 450&#186;C was also followed at higher temperatures. However, when the substrate is dipped at high temperatures and when the Fe2Al5-Znx grows to a considerably thickness, the limited diffusion rate of aluminium across a thick Fe2Al5-Znx layer resulted in the formation of FeZn10-Aly. When silicon was present in the substrate, the time for the intermetallic formation was much lengthened and the growth of Fe2Al5-Znx and therefore the whole intermetallic layer became considerably slower. When silicon was present in the melt, the intermetallic phases did not grow to any noticeable extent, at 450&#186;C and 470&#186;C. However, at 490&#186;C and above though the nucleation time of the intermetallic was also delayed, once nucleated the growth was fast resulting in a highly localized growth. It was found that the existing data on the interplanar spacings of Fe2Al5-znx were incorrect. The two most intense peaks were shown to be due to diffraction from 221 and 311 rather than from 002 and L30. A new list of interplanar spacings was proposed. It was shown that the lattice parameters and therefore interplanar spacings of Fe2Al5-Znx formed during galvanizing were dependent on the aluminium content of the bath. The compositions of intermetallic phases determined in this study were not, consistent with those expected from previously published ternary phase diagrams. At 450&#186;C, the solubility of zinc was found to be 5.3 wt% in FeAl3, 20.9 wt% in Fe2Al5, and 2.0 wt% in FeAl at 450&#186;C. Based on these results, a new version of the Fe-Al-Zn ternary phase diagram at 450&#186;C was proposed.</field><field name="date">1989</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2240</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The relationship of vocational identity to academic ability, locus of control and self-esteem</field><field name="creator">Malone, Paul (Paul Anthony)</field><field name="description">Bibliography: leaves 147-156</field><field name="date">1989</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation">SUA</field><field name="subject">Vocational interests</field><field name="subject">Academic achievement</field><field name="subject">Locus of control</field><field name="identifier">http://web4.library.adelaide.edu.au/theses/09ARM/09armm257.pdf</field><field name="identifier">NBD:8538994</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Women of Tikopia</field><field name="creator">Macdonald, Judith</field><field name="description">This thesis is based on 18 months fieldwork in 1979-80 in the Solomon Islands. The study was carried out among the Tikopia people both on their home island and in the settlement of Nukukaisi in Makira. The central focus of this study is an analysis of the women of Tikopia from several perspectives. First they are examined in time: the women of Professor Raymond Firth's study of 1929 are contrasted with women 50 years on. Next they are described in different geographical settings - the home island and the settlement. Special attention is paid to two categories of women: the fafine taka 'unmarried women' and the fafine avanga 'married women'. These two groups stand in strong contrast with one another. The unmarried women have considerable social and sexual freedom. However, their structural position in society is undergoing some redefinition as they are required to replace in the domestic workforce their brothers who have migrated as wage labourers to other parts of the Solomons. The departure of the young men has caused some demographic imbalance among the young and their absence decreases opportunities of marriage for the young women. No other career is available to young women as they do not leave Tikopia for schooling or work as their brothers do. By contrast, the married women, to whom marriage ostensibly brings social maturity, are the most tightly controlled section of the population, being responsible to the patriline into which they have married. The social and symbolic elements of gender relations in Tikopia are therefore examined through the lives of these two groups of women. A further concern which underlies this work are the developments in theoretical and methodological approaches to the study of gender by anthropologists, with special reference to their application in the Pacific area.</field><field name="date">1991</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420300 Cultural Studies::420307 Pacific cultural studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2243</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Probabilistic methods applied to slope stability analysis</field><field name="creator">St. George, J. D. (John D.)</field><field name="description">In slope stability analysis, as with other areas of geotechnical engineering, there is a high degree of uncertainty associated with design parameters. Engineers rely heavily on historical information and present performance to establish criteria. The observational approach which is essentially taking a Bayesian stance is advocated in most projects. The purpose of this study was to develop a method which will augment current design practice for mine slope stability, with the use of strength parameters derived from the back analysis of failures. A computerised database system for the storage of slope instability cases was developed using a commercial package. This enabled consistent and complete records of failures to be stored and recalled for analysis. To utilize these back analysis results in a probabilistic framework, a Bayesian approach was formulated to calculate the probability distribution of c-&#966;. Two separate likelihood functions were derived from the observations of slope failures in similar materials for 1) The functional relationship between the c-&#966; parameters required to meet critical equilibrium conditions. 2) The average normal and shear stress conditions on the failure surface. Uniform prior distributions were used to assess the likelihood function. Strength properties from tests and other sources were collated into informative priors and the corresponding posterior distributions defined. Both likelihood functions produced results in agreement with reported test results. A probabilistic model based on the first-order second moment approach was developed to cope with circular and non-circular slope stability analyses. The spatial variability of the random variables was incorporated into this model and by considering the contributions of the end resistance a quasi 3-D probability of failure was derived. All the case studies were analysed using this model with the posterior strength parameters. It was found that the spatial variability only had a major effect when the range of influence of the variability was small compared to the size of the slope. Both watertable and model error had much greater effect on the variance. The 3-D aspects of failure were investigated and a lateral release factor was introduced to assess the importance of the end resistance on the failure probability. A predictive analysis was presented to demonstrate the use of these methods in slope design. End resistance was shown to have most impact on 3-D probability of failure.</field><field name="date">1991</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2242</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Late Quaternary palynological investigations into the history of vegetation and climate in northern New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Newnham, Rewi M. (Rewi Munro)</field><field name="description">This thesis describes the vegetation and climatic changes over the past 20,000 years from pollen records at eight northern New Zealand lowland peat and lake sites, ranging from Taranaki to the Far North. The sites investigated are Umutekai Swamp (Taranaki), Lakes Rotomanuka, Rotokauri, and Okoroire (Waikato), Kopouatai Bog (Hauraki Plains), Lake Waiatarua (Auckland), Otakairangi Swamp (mid-Northland), and Trig Road Swamp (Far North). At sites from Auckland southwards, dating and correlation of the pollen records were enhanced by the occurrence of multiple tephra layers within the pollen-bearing sediments. The clearest picture of regional vegetation history and tightest chronologic control were obtained from the tephra-rich organic lake sediments of the Waikato lowlands. Holocene vegetation changes were broadly consistent throughout this northern New Zealand region and indicate climates, which were initially moist, mild and equable, but became increasingly variable and probably drier overall during the late Holocene. Podocarpangiosperm forest was always prominent and Agathis australis forest expanded throughout the region north of latitude 38&#176; S during the last 6,000 years. Kauri was especially prominent in the Waikato region during the 1000 years or so following the Taupo eruption of c.1800 years ago. At pollen sites from Waikato, Hauraki Plains, and Auckland, palynological evidence suggests that people began clearing forests as early as 800 years ago, but probably not much earlier. Pollen records for the last glacial show less regional uniformity. South of Auckland, scattered tracts of Nothofagus or Libocedrus forest within a shrubland/grassland mosaic were succeeded, between c.14.5 and 10 ka by the regional expansion of podocarp-angiosperm forest, with Prumnopitys taxifolia initially prominent. North of Auckland, the pre-Holocene vegetation history is complicated by uncertain chronologies. Conifer-angiosperm forest with prominent A. austalis grew in the Far North during the last glacial, while in mid-Northland, a substantial period of Nothofagus forest, shrub and grassland communities may correspond to either the entire last glacial or to the late glacial. Local variations in vegetation cover were maintained to some extent independently of regional climate, influenced by site specific factors including edaphic controls, hydroseral succession, and local hydrological changes caused by, e.g., lahar or lava flow, fluvial activity and sea level change. The influence of these local factors is most evident for the late glacial, during which period podocarp-angiosperm forest spread throughout northern New Zealand generally, but with considerable variation in timing even between nearby sites. Fire appears to have been an important factor in vegetation change throughout the period investigated, not just during the human deforestation era; peat swamp communities show a long history of association with fire, while in dryland vegetation, Agathis australis appears to have been especially affected by burning. No unequivocal evidence was found for postglacial latitudinal migrations, but several plants show significant altitudinal range expansions during the last glacial compared with their present distributions in northern New Zealand, viz., Nothofagus menziesii, Libocedrus bidwillii, Phyllocladus aspleniifolius, and Halocarpus spp. Thus although vegetation communities at each locality have changed substantially over time, the flora of northern New Zealand remained essentially the same during the c.20,000 years before the human era. Interpretation of the pollen records was assisted by principal components analysis (PCA) and by referring to modern pollen data and pollen-vegetation comparisons obtained from Waipoua Forest, Northland. PCA provides an efficient means of summarising and portraying large pollen datasets, and helps to clarify underlying environmental factors and temporal trends. PCA also generally supports pollen diagram zonations determined by eye. The Waipoua study indicated that the relationship between pollen and tree abundances is highly variable within forests, dependent largely on local site characteristics, especially the masking effect of strong local pollen sources. Nevertheless, quantified pollen-vegetation relationships averaged for the study area mostly accord with results from previous New Zealand modern pollen rain studies, while adding new information for the pollen representation of several prominent northern species. The Waipoua study indicates that pollen spectra rich in Agathis may be found where trees grow nearby, but Agathis pollen appears to be less widely dispersed than pollen of other New Zealand anemophilous taxa. At several swamp sites, correlation of tephra layers and pollen-stratigraphic events reveals problems with radiocarbon chronologies which can not be satisfactorily resolved except by assuming contamination by modern carbon. Sites with a history of hydroseral succession, where swamp communities have developed in former lake basins, are especially prone to this contamination, presumably because root penetration of older sediments provides channels for downward movement of younger carbon. In such situations it may be unwise to date and correlate pre-Holocene sediments on the basis of radiocarbon alone. Periods of hiatus are not uncommon in lake and swamp profiles from northern New Zealand and it is possible that the record of the last glacial is missing or strongly compressed at many Northland sites. Sedimentation rates also varied markedly between and within sequences, precluding the accurate estimation of pollen accumulation rates except at the Waikato lake sites where tephra sequences provide detailed chronological resolution. Even here, however, pollen concentration and accumulation rates appear to have been highly susceptible to short-term fluctuations in the sedimentation regime.</field><field name="date">1990</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::260000 Earth Sciences::260100 Geology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2253</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sandstone architecture and development of the Tunanui slope basin-fill, Hikurangi forearc, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Timbrell, Grenville</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::260000 Earth Sciences::260100 Geology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2227</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modelling of geysers</field><field name="creator">Saptadji, Nenny Miryani</field><field name="description">Geysers that discharge water and steam intermittently to the atmosphere are one of the rarest natural phenomena associated with geothermal systems. Several approaches including laboratory experiments, field observations and mathematical and numerical modelling studies are used in the present study to explain the behaviour of geysers and the important parameters controlling the eruption of geysers. A particular study is made of three geysers at Rotorua geothermal field: Pohutu, Prince of Wales Feathers and Waikorohihi. The existing mathematical model (steinberg et al., 1981a) is studied and an improved mathematical model is developed to accommodate two-phase flow and the variation in fluid properties with temperature. Both the existing and the improved mathematical models are used to model Pohutu and are able to reproduce not only the interval between eruptions but also the durations of the cavern filling and the duration of the pre-play stage observed by the author on the 20th of August 1993. Fully transient numerical models, which include the eruption process itself, are developed using MULKOM and the AUTOUGH2 simulators and produce reasonably good agreement with the analytical solutions and experimental data. The model provides information about the processes inside the geyser system and models the surface discharge which cannot be modelled using the Steinberg type of model. A fully transient model for Pohutu, which is developed using the AUTOUGH2 simulator, is able to reproduce the behaviour observed by the author on the 20th of August 1993. The results of sensitivity studies show that of the three Rotorua geysers, the Feathers is the most sensitive to changes in the rate of the hot upflow from depths. Both the Feathers and Waikorohihi are more sensitive to temperature changes than Pohutu. Pohutu is currently a vigorous geyser with preliminary pulsating spring behaviour; large changes in the rate and temperature of the hot upflow would be required to stop it erupting. All geysers are sensitive to variations in the water level and temperature in Te Horu.</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::291100 Environmental Engineering::291101 Environmental engineering modelling</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2259</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Two dimensional nonlinear seismic ground response studies</field><field name="creator">Marsh, E. J. Edward John</field><field name="description">The work in this thesis investigates the nature of the two dimensional nonlinear seismic ground response of alluvial basins. Computer programs are developed to analyse both the out-of-plane (SH) and in-plane (PSV) two dimensional solution spaces. A finite difference approach is utilised. The seismic input motion may originate from either below or from within the two dimensional mesh modelled. The analyses are performed in terms of total stresses and strains, and pore water pressures are not taken into account. A transmitting boundary allows energy to radiate from the solution space. The computations are performed with a nonlinear soil model which incorporates hysteretic material damping. The shape of the initial loading curve of the soil model may be arbitrary, but the majority of the analyses presented utilise a hyperbolic initial loading curve. Alluvial basins of constant L/H ratio are analysed subject to both vertically propagating seismic waves and seismic waves inclined at angles to the vertical. Both simple displacement pulse and complex transient earthquake acceleration input forms are utilised. Varying levels of excitation are employed to study the effect of strain level on the basin response. Two dimensional basins of varying L/H ratios are analysed subject to vertically propagating waves, and the results compared to a one dimensional nonlinear formulation. The results obtained using a hyperbolic initial loading curve are compared to those produced using initial loading curves derived from empirical relationships for dynamic soil properties. Results from the two dimensional nonlinear analysis are compared to those obtained from a two dimensional linear visco-elastic solution. A detailed case study is investigated with the two dimensional nonlinear analysis forming part of the Ashigara Blind Prediction Test. Elastic closed form solutions for simple two dimensional configurations are calculated, and time domain results compared to the nonlinear analysis. In-plane Rayleigh wave and out-of-plane Love wave characteristics in the nonlinear medium are investigated. A study of soil-structure interaction in the nonlinear medium is made. The feasibility of including discrete fault source models in the two dimensional analysis is investigated, with both dislocation and stress drop methods of input. The two dimensional nonlinear site response analysis method presented in this thesis is found to be a very flexible tool in calculating the ground response of alluvial basins to seismic waves. The method is relatively inexpensive computationally in the light of present computer capabilities. The method is therefore preferred to one dimensional and linear visco-elastic analyses in calculating the response of alluvial basins, given sufficient site data.</field><field name="date">1992</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290800 Civil Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2255</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An interdisciplinary approach to the prediction of pit lake water quality, Martha Mine pit lake, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Castendyk, Devin N.</field><field name="description">Lakes resulting from open pit mining may be potential water resources or potential environmental problems, depending on their water quality. As the global abundance of pit mines and pit lakes increases, there is increasing pressure on the mining industry to create pit lakes that have environmental, social, and/or economical utility. This thesis uses an interdisciplinary approach involving mineralogy, physical limnology, and geochemistry to predict and improve the water quality of a proposed pit lake at the Martha gold mine, New Zealand. A mineral quantification method developed for this study measured the distributions and concentrations of wall rock minerals, and identified 8 relatively homogeneous wall rock regions, called mineral associations. Acid-base accounting using calcite and pyrite quantities identified 3 associations with acid-generating potential. Three physical limnology tools (relative depth, wedderburn number, and numerical modeling with DYRESM), predicted that the upper 2/3 of the lake will circulate annually during the winter turnover period, whereas the lower 1/3 will remain permanently isolated. Permanent stratification resulted from density differences between groundwater and river water inputs during lake filling, plus lake morphology. The geochemical model used the distribution of mineral associations to characterize the composition of pit wall runoff, and used the limnologic prediction to define the mixing frequency, mixing depth, and layer volumes. Initial modeling with the geochemical program PHREEQC indicated the lake will have a pH of 5, and Cu and Zn concentrations that exceed aquatic life protection guidelines. Sensitivity analyses showed that subaqueous water-rock reactions did not have a significant affect on lake pH, suggesting these reactions are less important geochemical factors in pyrite-bearing pit lakes. Surface adsorption onto ferrihydrite reduced concentrations of As, Pb, and Cu, suggesting these reactions are important geochemical factors in pit lakes. By covering the acid-generating mineral associations, lake pH increased above 6.5, allowing for future recreational use. Concentrations of Cu complied with aquatic life protection guidelines, however, Zn concentrations remained above these guidelines. This study demonstrates the value of interdisciplinary pit lake predictions in the design of closure plans for open pit mines. Such studies improve the ability of mining companies to sustainably develop mineral resources.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300100 Soil and Water Sciences::300105 Applied hydrology (drainage, flooding, irrigation, quality etc)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2217</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Conceptualising the influence of clients on valuations</field><field name="creator">Levy, Deborah S.</field><field name="description">The review of property-related literature pertaining to valuer behaviour, valuation bias and smoothing all indicate that there are many behavioural issues that may affect valuation outcomes. Evidence suggests that heuristics may be one explanation for such phenomena, but a growing literature suggests that the role of the client within the valuation should also be considered. The main aim of this study therefore is to construct a framework of client influence in order to achieve an in-depth understanding of the commercial valuation process and the role played by the client within this process. Previous research in the area of behavioural property research has been undertaken utilising a quantitative research approach, however by introducing a qualitative approach a richer and more in-depth understanding of the topic was achieved. The research question addressed in this study was established as "How do clients influence valuation outcomes?". Constructionism identified the underlying assumption about reality governing the research; based on the premise that different people construct meaning in different ways in relation to the same phenomena. The theoretical perspective was determined to be interpretivism which was guided by the study's goal of assessing the nature of reality for both valuers and clients regarding the valuation process. The research process consisted of four stages, the first being the literature review and the construction of a preliminary framework of client influence. The second stage incorporated one-to-one interviews with valuers and the compilation of an updated framework. Stage 3 consisted of one-to-one interviews with clients and the compilation of a revised framework; and Stage 4 collected feedback from a number of experienced valuers and sophisticated clients in order to enhance the trustworthiness of the findings. The framework of client influence highlights eight main factors with the potential to affect the type and amount of client influence and power over the valuation process. These are described as the type of client; external pressures; valuer traits; the type of client valuer relationship; the characteristics of the valuation firm; the valuation process; the purpose of the valuation and finally technical valuation. In addition to the formulation of a framework of client influence the results provide a comprehensive understanding of the valuation process and specifically the incentives, power and opportunities clients have to influence valuations. The results of the study suggest that there are a number of specific influences not previously documented in the property literature that appear to have the potential to affect valuation outcomes and the valuations that are ultimately reported to stakeholders. In particular the strong influence the client has over the whole valuation process was uncovered. The main findings of the research suggest that clients possess not only the incentives and the ability to influence valuation outcomes, but the valuation process itself is largely governed by the client and provides opportunities for them to exert their power over the valuer. This influence does not only exist within the formal valuation process, but informally before the valuation has been commissioned. The study concludes by identifying scholarly contributions and contributions to the property profession. These suggest that the knowledge gained from the research can assist the property profession in understanding the role of both client and valuer in the valuation process and the tension that may exist between valuer independence and customer satisfaction. This knowledge can be used to effectively educate both valuers and clients of their roles in the valuation process together with areas where a valuer may be potentially vulnerable to undue influence.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::310000 Architecture, Urban Environment and Building</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2221</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Palynology and tephrostratigraphy of Quaternary coverbed sequences of the Auckland area, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Sandiford, Anna</field><field name="description">This thesis presents the results of detailed palynological and tephrostratigraphic investigations of five sites around the Auckland Isthmus, which collectively contain a fragmented record spanning approximately the last 1.2 million years. A range of additional methods were applied including, radiometric dating, palaeomagnetism, identification of other palynomorphs and fossil wood, and calculation of deposition rates. Study of two late Quaternary sites provided information on the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) environment of the Auckland Isthmus. This suggested LGM forest was spatially restricted, dominated by beech forest with minor podocarp elements and contained within extensive shruband grassland. Late Quaternary sites were more easily studied than early to mid Quaternary sites because the depositional environment in which they were found provided greater palynological and tephrostratigraphic detail. Detailed published late Quaternary tephrostratigraphy also allowed for tight chronological control, accurate interpolation of ages of uncorrelated tephra and assessment of the accuracy of radiocarbon dates. Forty late Quaternary tephra layers were identified, adding to the record of eruptions sourced from the Auckland Volcanic Field, Taupo Volcanic Zone and Taranaki Volcano. Since c. 24 ka the frequency of Late quaternary tephraforming events of significant volume to be recorded in the sediments on the Auckland Isthmus is 1 every 600 years. Study of early to mid Quaternary sites was hampered by lack of published tephrostratigraphic records for correlation. Last appearance data for four extinct taxa were tentatively extended. Significant depositional hiatuses were noted; the period between c. 1.0 Ma and c. 44 ka was particularly unsatisfactorily recorded. Three key tephra markers and nine previously undocumented tephra layers were documented. Spatial variation and alternating vegetation structure characterised cooler and warmer environments of the early to mid quaternary record. Extensive high diversity conifer-angiosperm forest occurred during warmer periods while reduced diversity beech-dominated forest contained within extensive shrub/grassland characterised the cooler periods. Certain combinations of taxa occurred during glacial/stadial and interglacial/interstadial periods and an attempt was made to generalise these. It was apparent the extremes of the LGM were not reached during this time, and-that climate oscillated between cool and warm periods sometimes characterised by vegetation assemblages without modem analogue. Extensive depositional hiatuses at one site, deposition of extremely thick, reworked, homogenous marine silt at a second site, and dipping bedding planes at a third site suggest sea level variation and/or tectonism were influential in the Quaternary depositional history of the Auckland Isthmus. However, not enough evidence was present to quantify this.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2218</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Teenage dating violence</field><field name="creator">Jackson, Susan M.</field><field name="description">Three studies were undertaken with high school students, unified by the goal of informing prevention programmes in high schools. The first study used a questionnaire to gather information from 373 students about their experiences of emotional, physical and/or sexual violence across heterosexual dating, peer and family relationships. Although girls and boys reported similar rates of all types of violence, the emotional consequences for girls were more adverse, girls were more likely to talk to someone about it and more likely to terminate the relationship. There was a correlation between violence victimisation in dating relationships and in the family. Experiences of peer violence were similar for boys and girls, although girls reported significantly more sexual harassment and boys significantly more physical violence. The two remaining studies in the research used a discourse analytic approach to examine the talk of students. One study used 12 group interviews in which 101 students were invited to talk about their perceptions of dating relationships and the violence that occurred within them. The key strand in the analysis of this talk was the social construction of masculine and feminine identities. Boys commonly drew on the discourses of naturalness, the sexually driven male and the patriarchal discourse. For girls, the prevailing discourses were the discourse of the body, the discourse of 'emphasised femininity' (traditional femininity) and, as with the boys, the patriarchal discourse. The other study involved analysis of 24 individual interviews with girls, who had themselves been in relationships with boyfriends that involved violence. Their stories were commonly threaded with the romantic narrative, but although girls at times positioned themselves within the passivity of romantic discourse and 'emphasised femininity', they also positioned themselves in the contradictory discourse of feminism. The high levels of reported violence in the questionnaire study supported a need for dating violence prevention programmes in schools as well as suggesting specific areas to target within programmes. The group interview study strongly indicated the need to foster alternative constructions of masculinity and femininity and the individual interview study pointed to the need to alert teenagers to the fusion of love and violence through exposing the trappings of romantic discourse.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::321200 380100 Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2250</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effect of reaccreditation on general practice in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Tracey, Jocelyn Margaret</field><field name="description">The Reaccreditation Programme of the Royal New Zealand College of General Practitioners (RNZCGP) became compulsory for all members in 1994. Ongoing reaccreditation of medical specialists is a new, but rapidly growing trend on which little research has been done. The aim of this thesis is to investigate the effects of reaccreditation on general practice in New Zealand in the first three years of the programme. The history and current status of reaccreditation programmes throughout the world is summarised. The requirements of the RNZCGP Reaccreditation Programme are described and contrasted with the requirements of other programmes. A basic assumption of the Reaccreditation Programme that general practitioners can accurately identify their own areas of deficiency, is tested and found to be incorrect. A very low correlation between general practitioners' self assessments of knowledge on a given topic, and their results on a written objective test was found. The attitudes of general practitioners to the Reaccreditation programme, both shortly before it began and three years post-implementation are tested using a validated semantic differential questionnaire. Initial acceptance was reasonably high, but this decreased with time. Qualitative and quantitative studies of the ways in which general practitioners have altered their educational activities because of the programme showed improvements in the quality of the activities selected, but little increase in overall time spent. Analysis of the effects of the compulsory audit aspect of the Reaccreditation Programme showed that this activity has resulted in significant improvements to patient care. The effects of the programme on general practice are analysed in the light of current change theories and finally recommendations are made regarding the possible future development of the RNZCGP Reaccreditation Programme.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321200 Public Health and Health Services</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2246</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Economy, ritual and history in a Balinese tourist town</field><field name="creator">MacRae, Graeme S.</field><field name="description">This work began in reflection upon the form of tourism in Ubud: in which rapid economic change and profound cultural conservatism appear combined in unlikely symbiotic relationship. It became, in the field, a set of parallel enquiries into tourism, economics, politics, ritual, spatial organisation and history linking Ubud with wider local, regional and global processes. My provisional argument goes something like this. The economic development associated with tourism has resulted in Ubud not in a wholesale replacement of the forms of traditional culture with those of international capitalist culture but instead with conservation, development and intensification of aspects of traditional culture. Tourism is in fact built upon the marketing of an image of traditional culture consisting primarily of the performing and plastic arts and an aesthetic of village life combining agricultural production and ritual activity. In practice tourism has transformed the economic foundations of this way of life from dependence upon agricultural production to dependence upon a whole new sector providing goods and services to tourists. This transformation has had varied effects upon the components of the marketing image. One the one hand it has made possible profitable commoditisation of traditional arts but on the other it has marginalised the agricultural sector in a number of ways. The relationship between tourism and ritual activity is less direct. While people have resisted direct commodification of ritual, they recognise its role as a tourist attraction. Ritual practices and the temples in which they take place have however been the subject of massive redevelopment. While the forms of these are traditional, their content is linked to tourism in more complex ways. This process has not been ad-hoc but has been the subject of de-facto management by various parties including the traditional aristocracy, foreign expatriates, government and an emerging middle class. This management has been enabled and limited by access of the various parties to key resources including English language, land, cultural knowledge, investment capital and government contacts. This thesis does not report on all of this but represents in effect a report upon work in progress, providing a broad overview and the first stage of what is now seen as an ongoing research project. It is presented as a series of linked sections designed to be read at three levels: 1. as stand-alone contributions to various sub-fields of Bali studies, 2. as a set of relationships between these sections which contribute to the argument outlined above and 3. as the outline of a larger research project linking Ubud into processes of wider geographical compass and historical depth. It begins with description of contemporary Ubud, the transformation of its economy and a brief history of tourism. The relationship between ritual and economy is discussed both in general terms and ethnographic detail to provide insight into the context of cultural ideas in which tourist development has taken place. The spatial organisation of ritual reveals patterns of cultural order and political influence requiring historical analysis which in turn focuses attention on the role of the traditional aristocracy and changing patterns of control over land and labour as key factors in understanding the contemporary situation.

This study used the physical activity questionnaire validated in the Auckland Heart Study Validation Project. Coronary heart disease is the leading cause of death and a major cause of morbidity in New Zealand. The Auckland Heart Study was a case-control study examining coronary heart disease and its risk factors and was conducted in Auckland from 1986 to 1988 (Jackson, 1989). This study incorporated a three month recall questionnaire on physical activity. The results showed that a high level of physical activity was associated with a low rate of coronary heart disease. For example the odds ratio for those with high levels of moderate leisure time physical activity was 0.78 for men and 0.39 for women. To assess the validity of the physical activity questionnaire, the Auckland Heart Study Validation Project was conducted in 1988. Both physical inactivity and hypertension are risk factors for coronary heart disease and physical activity is known to lower blood pressure. The Auckland Blood Pressure Control study was conducted during 1989-90 in order to assess the effectiveness of physical activity as a means of lowering blood pressure in a community setting. The physical activity questionnaire used in the Auckland Blood Pressure Control study was the same one validated in the Auckland Heart Study Validation Project. This thesis describes both the Auckland Heart Study Validation Project and the Auckland Blood Pressure Control study. The Auckland Heart Study Validation Project The 186 Participants for the Auckland Heart Study Validation Project were randomly selected from the control group of the Auckland Heart Study. Of those who could be contacted, 152 completed a seven day physical activity and food intake diary. The seven day diary was the gold standard for the three month physical activity recall questionnaire used in the Auckland Heart Study. The response rate for completing the seven day diary was 82%. The original control group had been randomly chosen from the community and hence the sub-sample of 152 participants represented a reasonable cross-section of the community. The correlations for the three month recall questionnaire compared with the seven day dairy, were 0.61, 0.49 and 0.86 for moderate, vigorous and total activity respectively. These findings were consistent with other validation studies in the literature. One of the strengths of the Auckland Heart Study Validation project was that it was undertaken in the community population for which it was intended. It was concluded that the three month physical activity recall measured physical activity in general and over the three recall period. Auckland Blood Pressure Control study Low levels of physical activity have been shown in observational studies to be associated with a high incidence of both coronary heart disease and hypertension. A concern with observational studies is that the findings may be due to confounding factors which are not able to be controlled, either in the design or the analysis. The best method of controlling for confounding is through the use of randomised controlled trials. The literature on physical activity as a means of lowering blood pressure contains many randomised trials and almost all have methodological weaknesses. Moreover, most of those studies have been conducted in laboratory settings; very few trials of physical activity and blood pressure have been conducted in community settings. The literature on salt restriction as a means of lowering blood pressure contains numerous well designed randomized controlled trials showing that salt restriction can lower blood pressure. While significant results have been achieved from salt restriction most of these studies have been involved intensive input from dietitians. None of the community based studies have demonstrated significant blood pressure reductions. The aim of the Auckland Blood Pressure Control study was to assess the effectiveness of physical activity and/or salt restriction as therapies to lower blood pressure in treated hypertensive patients in a community setting. The research design was a factorial design randomised controlled trial of physical activity and salt restriction as therapies for lowering blood pressure. Participants were recruited for the study from general practitioners and a variety of public advertisements. The study was conducted over six months and 181 of the baseline 208 participants completed the study. The two interventions were brisk walking for 40 minutes, three times a week and salt restriction advice. The main outcome measures were blinded blood pressures measured at three and six months. The average age of the participants was 55 years and there were approximately equal numbers of men and women. At the three month interview there was a statistically reduction in systolic blood pressure for salt restriction and physical activity as separate therapies, but not for the combination. There was no significant reduction in diastolic blood pressure at the three or six month assessment. Although the Auckland Heart Study three month recall questionnaire was valid for the case-control study there was concern that it was not sensitive enough for the randomised controlled trial. It was concluded that both physical activity and salt restriction lowered systolic blood pressure, at least in the short term, in persons with hypertension treated with medication in a community setting.</field><field name="date">1992</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321200 Public Health and Health Services</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2245</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Short-term electrical load prediction and related aspects</field><field name="creator">Kobe, Maria Ursula</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted at the request of the author</field><field name="date">1986</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::240000 Physical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2247</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Geochemical examination of the active hydrothermal system at Ngawha, Northland, New Zealand: hydrochemical model, element distribution and geological setting</field><field name="creator">Cox, M.E.(Malcolm E.)</field><field name="description">The Ngawha geothermal system is the only known high temperature (220-230&#730;C) system in New Zealand outside the Taupo Volcanic Zone. This current examination integrates new and available geochemical and geological data on the system and surroundings. Ngawha occurs in a Quaternary-Holocene basalt field, within a ENE-trending extensional fault block 15 km in width. The youngest volcanism in the region is associated with this structure. The basaltic activity changed in composition from earlier (? 1.5 to 0.5 m.y.) high-Al, to younger alkali basalt (&lt; 0.5 m.y. to at least 1200 yr b.p.). Crystal fractionation of the alkali basalt magma produced comenditic rhyolite lava, which outcrops as a dome near Ngawha, and is also inferred to have formed an unerupted intrusion, the likely heat source. The geothermal system has developed within pre-existing fault/fracture permeability in basement metasediments (Permian-Jurassic greywacke and argillite), and is concluded to be on the order of 10,000-20,000 years old. The hydrological model developed for the system is of a fault-bounded reservoir within basement rocks, formed of a series of blocks within which fluid migrates in fractures and joints. The reservoir has a low permeability base from silica deposition, and fluid is confined by a caprock of 500-700 m of Cretaceous-Tertiary marine sediments. This allows only vapour discharge at the surface, and minor local leakage of reservoir waters. Recharge to the system is indicated to occur from the N-NE, with subsurface discharge from the reservoir to the SW. Recharging waters are heated during deep circulation (? 3.5 km) and enter the reservoir from faults to the N and on the southern boundary. Vertical displacement of up to 100 m occurs on some of these faults. Most of the 15 wells drilled (usually 1000-1200 m deep) are within the reservoir. The reservoir fluids are slightly acid pH (5.6 at 230&#730;C) alkali C1 type, but contain high B (800 mg/kg) and NH3 (200 mg/kg). They have a high gas content, largely CO2 (1.2 wt %) and H2S (100 mg/kg). These fluids have ascended in boundary faults, "degassing" during ascent, with the greatest vapour separation in the upper part of the reservoir. The residual fluids then enter the reservoir. Most dissolved constituents are probably derived from high temperature (? 350&#186;C) leaching of metasediments at depth below the reservoir. Some, however, also have a magmatic component (CO2, S(H2S), N2(NH3), Hg). The fluids have elevated &#1073;18O values (+ 5.5 &#8240;) relative to local meteoric water (-5.5&#8240;), but reservoir rocks have only been depleted c. 1&#8240;. It is concluded the high &#1073;18O is derived from rock leaching at depth, a magmatic component and boiling enrichment during fluid ascent. Reassessment of the hydrothermal mineralogy and oxygen isotopes in quartz, show that the system previously contained 260&#186;-280&#186;C fluids. Tectonic (fault) movement resulted in an inflow of cooler groundwater from the E "flooding" part of the reservoir and reducing temperatures to c. 180&#186;C. continued inflow of hot water from the N and S, and heat in rocks, has reheated the reservoir to the current measured temperatures (c. 230&#186;C). The onset of the cool inflow was probably only several thousands of years ago, and it has persisted and produced a zone of fluid mixing across the central part of the reservoir. This inflow can be identified by oxygen and carbon isotopes (in quartz and calcite), fluid chemistry, alteration minerals, and major and trace element chemistry of rocks, as well as downhole temperatures. Temperature inversions have resulted in some parts. The distribution of major, and twenty-six trace elements, was examined in cores and cuttings from twelve geothermal wells, and compared to equivalent non-geothermal lithologies. Distribution was also related to temperature, permeability and mineralogy. Most major elements have been added to reservoir rocks, but there is obvious depletion of K and Al. Of trace elements, Ba, Rb and Th are strongly depleted. Most trace elements typically show trends of major elements with which they are associated, usually by ionic substitution (e.g. Ca-Sr; K-Rb). Zn, for example, is strongly associated with Fe-and Mg-bearing alteration minerals. Some elements can be correlated with temperature, such as increasing Li, Cd, S, Ca, La and Mg. Base metals are typically enriched 30-50% relative to non-geothermal samples. Element associations, are however, often hard to determine due to the limited distribution of alteration (very low water/rock ratios), the occurrence of elements in different mineral phases, and the episodic deposition of hydrothermal minerals. The basement rocks (Waipapa Group) are of quartzo-felds-pathic nature, but have a minor volcanic contribution. Ratios of immobile trace elements (La/V vs Y) appear to be useful in distinguishing whether geothermal samples are greywacke or argillite. Sulphur fugacities of Ngawha fluids are low and S-bearing minerals are not abundant. Sulphide minerals are of limited occurrence, pyrite being the main sulphide (&lt; 5% of rocks) with minor amounts of poorly crystalline pyrrhotite. Both are more common in the upper reservoir-lower caprock, a zone in which boiling occurs. Pyrite is often of earlier (hotter) formation, and pyrrhotite of the recent-current regime. Pyrrhotite is typically monoclinic or monoclinic + hexagonal. Minor arsenopyrite was found locally in a fault intersection; traces of sphalerite and chalcopyrite have been identified. Minor S as a sublimate forms veins at the surface, but hydrothermal SO4 minerals are in trace amounts only. Grains of primary (detrital) barite were identified in metasediments. Minor amounts of As and Sb sulphides occur at the surface in the main thermal zone. Within that area Hg was previously mined both as cinnabar in siliceous lenses, and adsorbed Hg&#730; in fine grain sediments. Mercury is transported through the system as Hg&#730; vapour. Downhole analyses of cuttings (30-50 m intervals) show Hg has not been leached from rocks in the reservoir, and is stable in pyrite at that temperature range (200&#730;-250&#730;C). The decrease of temperatures in the caprock (&lt;150&#730;C) allows adsorbed Hg&#730; to become stable and deposit. Gold and Ag are in low concentration in all geothermal rocks, the highest being Au = 0.07 ppm and Ag = 0.55 ppm. Gold is mostly associated with pyrite and concentrations are higher in the hot inflow zones; it is depleted in the cool inflow, presumably by subsequent dissolution. Silver occurs in pyrite, but also as other phases not identified (possibly in pyrrhotite), and is enriched in the cool inflow. Well discharge silica has relatively elevated concentrations (Au = 0.27, Ag = 13.9 ppm) and is considered analagous to sinter deposits that would form in the absence of a caprock. Sinters forming to the N of the thermal area, contain very low metallic trace elements, as they form from neutral pH HCO3 waters in the caprock. Modelling the hydrology of the overall system and using Au bisulphide solubilities suggests the likelihood that Au (and base metals) have deposited from the fluids in upflow zones before they enter the reservoir. This model appears to be supported by greater mineralisation in well Ng5 samples, in the N of the drillfield.</field><field name="date">1985</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::260000 Earth Sciences::260100 Geology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2226</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Continuing transformation: the structure, composition, and functioning of the New Zealand Labour Party in the Auckland region, 1949-70</field><field name="creator">Gustafson, Barry.</field><field name="description">Throughout the Western democracies since 1945, many Socialist and Labour Parties have apparently emulated organisationally their more conservative and often more successful middle-class rivals and have experienced what L.D. Epstein has termed 'contagion from the right'. This thesis sets out to examine this proposition in relation to what happened between 1949 and 1970 to the New Zealand Labour Party, specifically in the twenty-two electorates which, at the time of the 1969 election, comprised the Auckland Region of the Party. Data was gathered by a variety of methods which included the use of four different questionnaires; interviews; correspondence with all the Labour Members of Parliament in the Region; exhaustive research into Head Office records, which included membership returns, annual financial statements from branches, correspondence files, Conference records, and N.Z. Executive minutes; detailed examination of branch minute books; the utilisation of the records of the Auckland Regional Council, the defunct Auckland Labour Representation Committee, and various electorate organisations; and field and participant observation. A variety of approaches was used also in processing and presenting the data: descriptive, quantitative, comparative, and deductive. Part I describes and analyses the quantitative and qualitative changes in structure, composition and functioning that took place between 1949 and 1970. Part II compares the white-collar with the manual-worker branches, members, and activists in 1969 and 1970, Throughout, there is an attempt to explain what caused the various changes and to suggest what happens to a Labour Party as its membership becomes more white-collar in composition. The Appendices, which are contained in a second volume, include detailed statistical tables and figures and copies of the four questionnaires. Volume II also contains the Bibliography. It was found that, in response to the changing realities of its social, economic, and political environment, the N.Z.L.P. had altered considerably in the period studied. The changes were not mimetic but organic. The society changed dramatically. The composition of the Party - first at the Parliamentary level and later at the primary level - inevitably and at first imperceptibly changed also. The white-collar proportion of the Labour Party's membership in the Region studied rose from 15 per cent in 1949 to 51 per cent in 1970. The Party at the grass-roots level functioned mare and more in ways related exclusively to winning elections and showed a declining concern with ancillary social and solidarity considerations. Membership, branch meeting activity, and fundraising at the branch level, all declined dramatically. Significantly, branch activity increased only in regard to Annual Conference participation. The changes in society, which led to a change in the composition and policies of the Party, in turn altered the ways in which the Party functioned. Subsequently reluctant recognition of those changes resulted in an increasingly conscious attempt to formally restructure the Party in the direction it was being carried. The major conclusion reached in this dissertation is that a political party, if the N.Z.L.P. can be taken as an example of a more general trend, is so inextricably interdependent with its social environment that significant changes in society must inevitably be reflected in the composition of the Party and in the ways in which the Party functions. Those changes in composition and functioning in part constitute and in part impel both attitudinal and organisational changes which amount to a continuing transformation of the Party itself to accord with the new social realities.</field><field name="date">1973</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::360000 Policy and Political Science::360100 Political Science::360101 New Zealand government and politics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2248</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Work relations and forms of production in New Zealand agriculture</field><field name="creator">Blunden, Greg</field><field name="description">This thesis contributes to the debates over the conceptualisation of enterprises involved in agriculture, the industrialisation of agriculture and the reproduction and subsumption of family farms. In making this contribution, a framework is developed for the examination of work relations and forms of production in apple orcharding and dairy farming in New Zealand. It is argued that many of the intense debates in the literature result from the research perspectives which are used - principally Marxist perspectives. While sympathetic to Marxist theory, a realist perspective is adopted to lessen these problems. Middle-order theory is developed to fill the gap between high political economy and the concrete world of agricultural production. The theory suggested here is tangible in the world of experience. Three themes, all of which are undervalued in the literature, guide the theoretical discussions - work relations, the biophysical basis of agricultural production and the concept of different forms of production. Flexibility is the concept used to integrate these themes. In the first stage of theoretical development and integration, two types of conceptually different workers are theorised: wage workers and self-employed workers have different motivations for work and different flexibilities in doing their work. From this basis, a functional typology of work relations in agriculture is developed, which differentiates all workers and enterprises. In the second stage, the flexibility of workers is matched with the labour demands of hypothetical production systems which are based to differing extents on biophysical resources. Some of these production systems are able to be controlled and consequently made more amenable to wage labour than are others. The third theme argues that two conceptually different forms of production exist &#8211; simple commodity production and capitalist production. The generalised exchange relations of capitalism are held to be a necessary condition for the emergence of simple commodity production. The power of these conceptualisations is tested by extending the concept of simple commodity production to include sharecropping. It is argued that non-ownership of the farm is the only criteria by which sharecroppers can be excluded from being classified as simple commodity producers, and this is less important than the ownership of the share contract. Apple orcharding and dairy farming in New Zealand are the focus of the empirical part of this research. First, the production system for each industry is established in relation to their dependence on biophysical systems. Then secondary data, and the information from postal questionnaires and interviews with key informants are used to examine the social relations of production in core regions of production, and in regions where each industry has expanded substantially during the 1980 to 1994 period. The production system for apples features two distinct demands for labour which are related to the biophysical inputs. One is a relatively small, permanent work force which must be flexible to attend to the capricious nature of the biophysical resource, and the other is relatively large, lumpy demands for labour, especially at the harvest. These lumpy demands for labour can be met only by accessing external labour markets. The forms of production in the apple industry are distinguishable as either simple commodity producers or capitalist producers. The family enterprises are categorised as simple commodity producers, despite, in some cases, a relatively low contribution of labour by family workers to the enterprise. The three large, fully-capitalist apple producers have reduced their exposure to apples, an indication that the prospects for regular sustainable profits by capitalist producers from apple production are not sufficient. The milk production system is characterised by a demand for high levels of permanent numerical flexibility and high contributions of family labour. Its pastoral basis imposes limits on the scale of individual farms, and these farms are ideally suited to family-based enterprises &#8211; simple commodity producers. Sharemilking is an integral part of the industry. Despite the lack of farm ownership, these sharecroppers can be classified as simple commodity producers. That the large-scale capitalist dairy farmers use mostly 50/50 sharemilkers to operate the majority of their farms supports the contention that sharemilking is the most efficient way for capitalist farmers to organise production. The apple industry is more amenable to the capitalist form of production than pastoral dairy farming because of the higher seasonal demands for labour external to the family, the lower levels of labour flexibility required by the production system and the limits of scale which are part of pastoral dairy farming do not exist in apple orcharding. Yet simple commodity producers are likely to persist in apple orcharding because of their inherent characteristics as a form of production. While capitalist producers must make a certain profit to maintain their presence in any industry, the motivation of simple commodity producers revolves around the duality of household and enterprise, and its reproduction Key words: Work relations, Flexibility, Biophysical conditions of production, Simple commodity production, Capitalist production, Sharecropping, Sharemilking, Subsumption, Apple orcharding, Dairy farming, New Zealand.</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370400 Human Geography</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2258</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Business-IT Alignment and Shared Understanding Between Business and IS Executives: A Cognitive Mapping Investigation</field><field name="creator">Tan, Felix B.</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences::280100 Information Systems::280102 Information systems management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2228</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Me he korokoro ko&#772;mako = &#8217;With the throat of a bellbird&#8217; : a Ma&#772;ori aesthetic in Ma&#772;ori writing in English</field><field name="creator">Battista, Jon Lois</field><field name="description">The primary aim of this thesis Me he korokoro k&#333;mako [&#8216;With the throat of a bellbird&#8217;] is to demonstrate the existence of a distinctive M&#257;ori aesthetic in M&#257;ori literature written in English. Its introductory section, of three chapters, investigates the ways in which mainstream critical discourse in various ways appropriates M&#257;ori literature to its own Western-derived models of meaning and values, and proposes instead a definition of a M&#257;ori aesthetic grounded in the principle of whakapapa, whose whole cultural components for M&#257;ori literature include distinctive textual functions for myth, orality, acts of naming, other aspects of language, and symbolism. The concept of whakapapa also provides the organizing principle and methodology of the central chapters of the thesis, which are divided into two Parts &#8211; each of six chapters. These are framed by a Prologue and Epilogue, whose subject is the profound cultural symbolism of the waka in the work of a founding figure for M&#257;ori writing in English, Jacqueline Sturm, and in Star Waka, by a major later writer in English, Robert Sullivan. Part One devotes three chapters each to the adult fiction of one female writer, Patricia Grace (Potiki and Baby No-Eyes), and one male writer, Witi Ihimaera (The Matriarch). Part Two, following the principle of whakapapa, devotes six chapters to M&#257;ori literature for children. Its primary text is the major anthology of such writing &#8211; Te Ara O Te Hau: The Path of the Wind, Volume 4 of Te Ao M&#257;rama, edited by Witi Ihimaera, with Haare Williams, Irihapeti Ramsden and D.S. Long. It grounds its reading of the volume&#8217;s many texts (literary and visual, in M&#257;ori and in English) in the many distinctive cultural behaviours and meanings attached to the figure of M&#257;ui. Each of the authors and texts has been chosen in order to study and exemplify a particular aspect of the M&#257;ori aesthetic defined in the Introduction, through close readings which draw strongly on the work of major M&#257;ori social historians, authors of iwi histories and genealogies, and interpreters of cultural meanings attaching to the natural worlds, and recent work on literary stylistics by Geoffrey Leech and others. It also draws on conversations with numerous M&#257;ori informants, including some of the authors discussed. The readings are designed to reveal the rich, culturally contextualised knowledges which M&#257;ori readers bring to the texts, and which their authors share and invoke through their deployment of the values and practices of whakapapa. While such representations and explorations of self offer new interpretive possibilities for P&#257;keh&#257; readers, they are also part of a global movement in which indigenous peoples engage in the politics of decolonisation from a position of strength, the stance of self-knowledge.

This thesis analyses three such mechanisms. In Part I, I consider the use of coinsurance to limit the demand for health care. Because coinsurance reduces the elasticity of demand with respect to the price of health care, consumers facing low coinsurance rates may be charged a higher price by doctors. Such discriminatory pricing enables the doctor to extract surplus created in the insurance market, and therefore reduces the effectiveness of coinsurance. I show that in equilibrium, some consumers remain uninsured. I also show how this problem is solved if the doctor and insurer enter into managed care style arrangements. Such arrangements improve insurer and doctor profitability, and restore complete insurance market coverage. In Part II, I consider the design of fundholding schemes which encourage doctors to restrict expensive treatment to severely ill patients. I show that such schemes may be undermined by a patient-doctor side contract. In the face of such patient-doctor collusion, the fundholding scheme may be made collusion-proof by increasing its "power". I show that the optimal collusion-proof scheme may pay the doctor more than his reservation wage. An alternative solution to patient-doctor collusion is to use a partial fundholding scheme that requires some additional co-payment from the patient. Part III analyses New Zealand's internal market reforms. Introduced in 1993, the reforms involved the separation of funding and provision of health care, and were intended to simulate a competitive market environment, thereby improving the incentives of government owned health care providers to be efficient. On the supply side, I look at the internal restructuring of hospitals into private-sector clones. I argue that this commercialisation failed to take account of informational issues within the hospital. On the demand-side, I examine the suitability of internal markets for eliciting optimal innovation from the hospital sector. Again, I find that a standard argument, namely that increased competition leads to innovation, is questionable in the context of the internal market.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::340000 Economics::340200 Applied Economics::340204 Health economics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2235</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Non-Markovian Quantum Trajectories</field><field name="creator">Jack, Michael Wong</field><field name="description">The technique of quantum trajectories (stochastic Schr&#246;dinger equations or Monte Carlo wave functions) for open systems is generalized to the non-Markovian regime. I consider a microscopic model of an open system consisting of a boson field coupled linearly (with an excitation preserving coupling) to a localized system. The model allows for a field with an arbitrary dispersion relation and an arbitrary mode-dependent coupling to the system. The trajectories are formulated as continuous measurements of the output field from the system. For a general dispersive field these measurements must be distributed in space for this formulation to be possible. The result of this formulation is a non-Markovian equation for the system conditioned on the measurements. A method of numerically simulating this equation has been determined and implemented in some test cases. Numerical simulation is possible if one can introduce a finite memory time for the evolution of the reduced system. As an illustration, the method is applied to the spectral detection of the emission from a driven two-level atom and also to an atom radiating into an electromagnetic field where the free space modes of the electromagnetic field are altered by the presence of a cavity. In both cases the non-Markovian behaviour arises from the uncertainty in the time of emission of a photon that is later detected (or reabsorbed), although, in the second case, the non-Markovian behaviour is intrinsic to the system environment coupling whereas, in the spectral detection case, it is a consequence of the choice of measurement process. The generalization of the techniques of quantum trajectories to the non-Markovian regime promises to make a range of open system problems where the Born-Markov approximation is invalid tractable to numerical simulation.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::240000 Physical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2237</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Thiocarbonyl complexes of ruthenium and osmium</field><field name="creator">Collins, Terence James</field><field name="description">This thesis deals with thiocarbonyl complexes of ruthenium and osmium [LnM-CS]. In chapter 1 a comprehensive review of all transition metal thiocarbonyl complexes is presented. Unlike carbon monoxide, carbon monosulphide is a highly reactive molecule which does not exist under normal laboratory conditions. However, transition metal complexes of this reactive intermediate are typically stable compounds of which there are now approximately two hundred reported examples. This small number has made a complete review possible. Slow spasmodic growth has accompanied transition metal thiocarbonyl chemistry since the prototype complex was discovered in 1966 and chapter 1 discusses the synthetic reasons for this, describes critically the current bonding models, and presents the reactions of thiocarbonyl complexes. The very new field of the chemistry of selenocarbonyl complexes [LnM-CSe] is included and comparison with this and with the well-documented chemistry of carbonyl complexes allows for an analysis of periodic changes. The review indicates that CS ligand reactions had received little attention at the outset of this project. Interligand reactions involving CS were unknown primarily because thiocarbonyl complexes containing ligands suitable for investigating reactions of this type had not been synthesised. In particular, transfer of hydrido or aryl ligand to CS had not been observed. Such reactions are the subjects of chapters 3 and 6. The investigation of these transfer reactions necessitated the prior preparation of complexes containing hydrido or aryl ligands cis to the thiocarbonyl ligand. Suitable complexes were synthesised from the very versatile synthetic intermediate OsCl2 (CS) (PPh3)3 [Chapter 3], which was discovered after considerable effort had been devoted to finding high yield routes for introducing the CS ligand into the coordination sphere of ruthenium and osmium [Chapter 2]. Chapter 3 is concerned with hydride transfer to the CS ligand. The thioformyl ligand [OS-C-H-S] results from the transfer of one hydrido ligand to CS and subsequent reactions, which are also probably hydride transfers, produce the thioformaldehyde [Os-S-C-H-H] and methylthiolato [Os-SCH3] ligands. The possible relevance of these ligands as models for postulated intermediates in the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis is noted. The thioformyl and thioformaldehyde ligands were hitherto unknown and the formulations have been additionally verified by investigating the reactivity of these novel ligands and characterising the derivatives obtained. A synthetic route to secondary carbine complexes and to nitrogen and oxygen equivalents of the thioformyl ligand [Os-C-H&#8212;NMe and Os-C-H&#8212;O] is demonstrated. The review in chapter 1 also recounts how observation has shown that strong &#963;-donor and strong &#960;-acceptor properties of the CS ligand exert a profound effect upon the reactivity of CS complexes. In particular, strong &#960;-acceptor properties mark the CS ligand as an ideal candidate for stabilising very electron-rich metal centres such as d8 ruthenium(O) or osmium(O). In chapter 4 high yield routes to zerovalent osmium thiocarbonyl complexes are detailed and the reactivity of these complexes is exploited to afford the first high yield syntheses of dithiocarbonyl complexes. The thiocarbonyl ligand is also viewed, from the collected information in chapter 1, as being more responsive to the coordinative environment than the better-known carbonyl ligand. Thus, while CS can remove more electron-density from basic metal centres than CO, CS can also donate more electron-density than CO when coordinated to very electron-poor metal centres. Consequently, it is not surprising that reactions which have been regarded in a classical sense as electrophilic or nucleophilic attack at CO are also found for CS. In chapter 5 several novel reactions which can be described as nucleophilic attack at the CS carbon atom are reported for both neutral and cationic complexes. One such reaction is an interligand reaction of cis thiocarboxamido and thiocarbonyl ligands which affords a four-membered osmium metallocycle. Chapter 6 describes how coordinatively unsaturated aryl-thiocarbonyl-containing complexes react with potentially bidentate anionic ligands to produce coordinatively saturated complexes. coordinative saturation also occurs with carbon monoxide or isocyanide and these latter compounds undergo a rearrangement reaction which involves the thiocarbonyl ligand. Available evidence, which includes the results of an incomplete X-ray crystal structure determination, suggests that a bidentate thioacyl ligand [Os-S-C-R] is produced by transfer of the aryl ligand to CS with ring-closure. Some further reactions of this novel ligand are also discussed. In conclusion, the work reported here extends this research group&#8217;s interest in the chemistry of low valent transition metal compounds and the ligands which stabilise such compounds to thiocarbonyl complexes of ruthenium and osmium. The present status of the chemistry of transition metal thiocarbonyl complexes has been examined and the work presented in the experimental chapters contributes to this small area of chemistry by examining, for the first time, interligand reactions which involve CS, by providing synthetic routes to CS complexes of osmium(O), and by beginning to examine the synthetic potential of the novel compounds and ligands obtained.</field><field name="date">1977</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2239</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Spectroscopic studies of chemically synthesised polyaniline and its ability to act as radical scavenger</field><field name="creator">Gizdavic-Nikolaidis, Marija</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.

The experiment has the well-established result that, ceteris paribus, a brief tone burst is more readily letected than a brief gap in a tone. Two models, one based on the neuroelectrical activity of the auditory nerve and one on energy-detection theory, are presented and developed in detail: both are shown capable of predicting the result of the bursts and gaps experiment. Seven experiments are reported. Experiment 1 found the reaction time to the start of a faint tone embedded in noise generally shorter than that to its end. Experiment 2 examined the effect of rise/decay time on the detectability of brief bursts of, or gaps in, broadband noise: when the energy change was constant, 1here was no effect except at long (100 msec) rise/decay times. Experiments 3 and 4 assessed the detectability of bursts of, and gaps in, a tone embedded in noise where energy change to noise power per cycle was constant but duration varied. The data demonstrate that the effect of duration on detectability was different for burst than gap events, a result predicted by both models. Experiment 5 showed that, when the energy in and duration of a tone burst in noise were constant but the temporal distribution of the burst energy varied, detectability remained unchanged. The repetition rate of noise bursts and gaps in continuous noise was varied without effect on detectability in Experiment 6. Bursts, however, were consistently mere detectable than gaps. Experiment 7 compared the detectability of increments and decrements of a continuous tone embedded in noise. The quantitative predictions of the two models are compared with the data resulting from Experiments 3, 5, and 7. The qualitative results of these and the other experiments are also discussed in terms of their theoretical implications. Taken all together, the experiments do not definitely favour either model over the other.</field><field name="date">1979</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2260</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluation of natural antioxidants</field><field name="creator">Zhang, Jingli, 1966-</field><field name="description">This thesis relates the physicochemical properties of phenolic compounds to their antioxidant activities. It focuses on the partitioning of phenolic compounds between hydrophilic and lipophilic environments and the relevance this has to their in vivo health effects. Data in the literature was lacking so the phase partition coefficients (log P) of 53 phenolic antioxidants were measured by reversed-phase HPLC and calculated by log P prediction software. There was a very strong linear correlation between measured and calculated values (r=0.91). The importance of log P in determining antioxidant assay values was then tested by developing an assay system capable of measuring activities of both hydrophilic and lipophilic antioxidants. This Lipid Peroxidation Inhibition Capacity Assay (LPIC), based on using liposomes to simulate a cell membrane environment, was then used to measure the activity of antioxidants with a broad range of structures. The activities were correlated against log p, the difference of heat of formation (&#8710;Hf) and half-wave potential (Ep/2) and used to derive a predictive model to calculate the LPIC activity. There was a highly significant linear correlation between the calculated and measured values. The LPIC activities also correlated well to published LDL inhibition activities but not to measured ORAC activities. These findings suggested that behaviours of antioxidants in the small unilamellar vesicles of the LPIC assay were similar to that in the LDL assay but not to the aqueous phase based ORAC assay. The LPIC assay may therefore be a better indicator of potential health benefits of antioxidants in the human body than the ORAC assay. The possible mechanistic reasons are that it may better reflect ability to prevent the oxidation of LDL blood stream particles that leads to cardiovascular disease and also takes into account the importance of membrane solubility which can raise the cellular concentration and thus potential to protect cells from oxidative damage.

Instead of looking for economic impacts of the now-available technological tools, this research investigates how local individuals use (or not) computers, and analyses the mechanisms by which computer-mediated information, obtained by those who use computers, is disseminated through their customary face-to-face interactions with their compatriots. A holistic multiple-case study design was the basis for the data collection process. Data were collected during four-and-half months of fieldwork. Grounded theory informed both the method of data analysis and the technique for theory building. As a result of an inductive thinking process, two intertwined core themes emerged. The first theme, individuals&#8217; exploitation of ICT, is related to how some individuals overcome some difficulties and try to make the most of the now available ICT tools. The second theme, complementing existing social networks through ICT, reflects the interaction between the newly ICT-mediated information and virtual networks and the local existing social networks. However, these two themes were not evenly distributed across the communities studied. The evidence revealed that dissimilarities in social cohesion among the communities and, to some extent, disparities in physical infrastructure are contributing factors that explain the unevenness. But social actors &#8211; named as &#8216;activators of information&#8217; &#8211; become the key triggers of the disseminating process for fresh and valuable ICT-mediated information throughout their communities. These findings were compared to the relevant literature to produce theoretical generalisations. As a conclusion, it is suggested any ICT intervention in a developing country requires at least three elements to be effective: a tolerable physical infrastructure, a strong degree of social texture and an activator of information.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">information and communication technology (ICT)</field><field name="subject">human capital</field><field name="subject">social capital</field><field name="subject">institutions</field><field name="subject">developing countries</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences::280100 Information Systems</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2357</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Stability and efficiency properties of implicit Runge-Kutta methods</field><field name="creator">Burrage, Kevin</field><field name="description">This thesis is divided into two sections. The first section examines certain stability properties of implicit Runge-Kutta methods. In particular, a new stability property is defined, which is a modification to non-autonomous problems of A-stability, and its relation to B-stability is considered. A Runge-Kutta method is written as [see 01front.pdf for graphic] and classes of methods are constructed based on the property &#8721;sj=1aijck-1j = cki/k, i = 1,...,s and k = 1,...,s-1, where c1,...,cs are assumed to be distinct. Under this assumption a transformation is made, such that A = VsAsV-1s, where Vs is the Vandermonde matrix whose (i,j) element is cj-1i, and As has a special structure. These methods are examined in the light of the various stability criteria. It is also shown that the growth of errors can be estimated by an extension of this new stability theory and a number of examples are given. In the second section we consider the solution of stiff differential equations by implicit Runge-Kutta methods. In particular, we examine a procedure suggested by Butcher [6] which enables an efficient implementation of Runge-Kutta methods. He has shown that the most efficient methods when using this implementation are those whose characteristic polynomial of the Runge-Kutta matrix has a single real s-fold zero. Based on this criterion a family of methods, called singly-implicit methods, is constructed, and results concerning their maximum attainable order and stability properties are given. Some consideration is also given to showing how local error estimates can be obtained, by the use of embedding techniques, for both singly-implicit methods and the more general family of implicit Runge-Kutta methods. Finally, an algorithm based on these singly-implicit methods is presented. It is tested on a number of stiff differential equations, and comparisons are made between this algorithm and others currently in use.</field><field name="date">1978</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::230000 Mathematical Sciences::230100 Mathematics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2262</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Refraction of Satellite Signals</field><field name="creator">Heron, M. L. (Malcolm Lewis), 1944-</field><field name="description">Work began in March 1967 with the design and construction of the fixed interferometer (described in Chapter 2) for measuring the elevation angle of arrival of 20MHz signals from the satellite Beacon-B. Also during this first year most of the computing was completed for the theoretical calculations on ray paths presented in Chapter 5; these results along with some previously obtained experimental results form the basis of a paper accepted by Radio Science. Records were obtained from the interferometer from April 1968 to the end of the transmitting life of Beacon-B in January 1970. The analysis of the phase traces from the two aperture interferometer was complicated by the automatic antenna switching procedures; each transit had to be annotated and the useful chart delineated manually before the analysts recorded the phase at intervals of a few seconds on a semi-automatic digital recording system. The antenna switching was designed to save electronics and one channel on the chart recorder, but lead to a computer programming effort which may have been more costly in time and lost transits than the saving achieved by avoiding two separate interferometers (Chapter 2). While this programming and analysis were going on, the computing delays on the University&#8217;s overworked IBM 1130 gave time to follow up the idea of recording the fast Faraday fading on 20 MHz signals from a satellite near to or even below the horizon. This project was simplified by the availability of an easily converted 20 MHz receiver and a digital recording system. The report on this project is given in Chapter 4 and also in a short paper. The elevation angle measurements from the interferometer were converted to virtual height increment versus equivalent vertical frequency plots and thence to electron density profiles (Chapter 3, Part I). This analysis was developed from ideas given originally by Titheridge (1964). The interpretation of the resulting values of the scale height at the peak (Chapter 3, Part II) in terms of ionosphere morphology depended heavily on the total content hourly values maintained on computer disk by Dr Titheridge. The results and discussion in Chapter 3 will be presented as a separated paper. Chapter 6 is a review of the effects of the ionosphere on transmitted satellite signals and in particular gives a wider view of Faraday fading than is normally taken. Because of its general nature Chapter 6 can serve as an introduction to satellite radio propagation techniques; it appears at the end of this thesis as common ground after the diversions of Chapters 4 and 5. Since this work falls into three separate projects of ray elevation angle measurements, fast Faraday fading, and second order Faraday rotation calculations, the reports on each have been written with minimal cross referencing; this should facilitate reading but has resulted in a small amount of repetition.</field><field name="date">1971</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::291700 Communications Technologies::291710 Radio communications and broadcasting not elsewhere classified</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2263</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Investigation of Intracellular Isosmotic Regulation in the Mollusc Melanopsis Trifasciata (Gray 1843.)</field><field name="creator">Bedford, Jennifer June.</field><field name="description">An estuarine mollusc Melanopsus trifasciata was studied with respect to its osmoregulatory capacity.

However it is isosmotic and more or loss isotonic with the environment as far as the haemocoelic fluid is concerned. An attempt was made to find out how or why this response of the cells to changing external osmotic pressure comes about. Various techniques were used: puromycin to block protein synthesis, labelled amino acids, time experiments, enzyme assays, and so on.

The thesis poses the broad questions of what is the range of women's attitudes to specific issues, what patterns are there to women's attitudes and how well do traditional political categories describe women's attitudes? Attitudes of women to five civil rights or moral policy issues censorship, corporal punishment, the death penalty, abortion and homosexual law reform - are examined and the way women identify themselves in terms of feminism and the left-right spectrum is also discussed. A feminist approach is adopted and focus group interviewing is the methodology which is used for the study. Some of the labels used to describe attitudes to political issues and political identification are discussed. The way the women interpret the labels of left and right and feminism are examined and patterns of self-identification with these political terms are looked at. The attitudes expressed by the women to the five policy issues are categorised according to libertarian, liberal, conservative, neo-conservative, authoritarian or humanitarian labels. The patterns of attitudes and identification are explored. The findings are that diversity and plurality characterise the women's views. Their opinions cover almost the whole range of views on the five issues, they respond differently to the use of the left-right spectrum and the label of feminism, and almost every woman demonstrates an ideological profile which is uniquely her own. There are some similarities among the women, but patterns cannot be easily identified using the traditional political labels. There is also an assessment made of the value of the focus group methodology which has been used rarely in political science. The thesis ends by posing more questions. The adequacy of the liberal and conservative categories for classifying attitudes is raised and there are questions about whether the focus group interview method is gender specific.</field><field name="date">1993</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::360000 Policy and Political Science::360100 Political Science::360104 Political theory and political philosophy</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2266</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Social Relations in a Northland Maori Community</field><field name="creator">Bhagabati, Annada Charan</field><field name="description">The Maoris today occupy a unique position in the wider New Zealand society.

With limited knowledge of the underlying pathological molecular mechanisms, pharmaceutical intervention has to-date not provided any effective clinical treatment strategies to attenuate or compensate the neuronal cell death.  Attention has therefore turned to biotherapeutic molecules and novel treatment approaches to promote restoration and protection of selectively vulnerable populations of neurons in the HD brain. Rapid advances in vectorology and gene-based medicine over the past decade have opened the way for safe and efficient delivery of biotherapeutics to the CNS.  With numerous factors known to regulate the development, plasticity and maintenance of the mammalian nervous system many proteins have emerged as potential therapeutic agents to alleviate HD progression.  This investigative study utilised gene delivery vectors derived from the non-pathogenic adeno-associated virus (AAV) to direct high-level expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), glial cell-line derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), Bcl-xL or X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) within the rodent striatum.  Maintenance of the basal ganglia and functional behaviour deficits were assessed following excitotoxic insult of the striatum by quinolinic acid (QA), a neurotoxic model of HD pathology.  Enhanced striatal expression of BDNF prior to QA-induced lesioning provided maintenance of the striosome-matrix organisation of the striatum, attenuating impairments of sensorimotor behaviour with a 36-38% increase in the maintenance of DARPP-32 / krox-24 expressing striatal neurons, reduced striatal atrophy and increased maintenance of striatonigral projections.  Higher levels of BDNF however induced seizures and weight-loss highlighting the need to provide regulatable control over biotherapeutic protein expression.  Continuous high-expression of BDNF or GDNF resulted in a downregulation of intracellular signal mediating proteins including DARPP-32, with AAV-GDNF not found to enhance the overall maintenance of striatal neurons.  Neither of the anti-apoptotic factors provided significant protection of transduced striatal neurons but tended towards ameliorating QA-induced behavioural deficits, displaying behaviour &#8211; pathology correlations with the survival of parvalbumin-expressing neurons in the globus pallidus.  The results of this thesis suggest BDNF as a promising putative biotherapeutic for HD, but emphasises the requirement to control expression following gene delivery, and for further elucidation of the physiological impact that enhanced expression of endogenous factors has on the host cells.  Additionally the maintenance of neural networks beyond the caudate-putamen will be vital to ensuring efficient clinical outcomes for HD.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Huntington's Disease</field><field name="subject">Gene Delivery</field><field name="subject">Adeno-associated virus</field><field name="subject">Brain derived neurotrophic factor</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::329900 Other Medical and Health Sciences::329903 Therapies and therapeutic technology</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::320700 Neurosciences::320702 Central nervous system</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2363</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A molecular and evolutionary study of skua breeding systems</field><field name="creator">Millar, Craig D. (Craig Donald)</field><field name="description">The skua (Family Stercorariidae) are a group of large, gull-like, predatory seabirds. Two skua species are found in the Antarctic region; the south polar skua (Catharacta maccormicki) and the brown skua (C. lonnbergi). The breeding distribution of the former, is restricted to the Antarctic continent and nearby islands, while the latter has a circumpolar distribution which extends northward from the Antarctic Peninsula and includes many of the Southern Ocean islands. The south polar skua is strictly monogamous, while in contrast, a number of populations of brown skua are comprised in part of communally breeding groups. The brown skua represents the only known example of a communally breeding seabird. In every skua species, breeding females are on average larger and heavier than males. However, in most skua species this dimorphism is relatively small and is of only limited use in sexing individuals. The discovery of sex-specific fragments in the DNA fingerprints of the south polar skua is reported. The multilocus probe pV47-2 hybridised to Hae III restriction fragments which were present exclusively in females and therefore presumably W-linked. The presence of these sex-specific fragments were used to identify female adults and chicks. In addition, the use of these fragments as potentially informative maternal markers is discussed. The parentage of the 13 families from two populations from Ross Island, Antarctica, determined by DNA fingerprinting, revealed a single instance of extra-pair paternity and a single instance of a chick which was parented by neither resident adult. The most likely explanation for the latter is the 'adoption' of a chick from a neighbouring territory. Similarly, DNA fingerprinting was used to assign the sex of individuals of brown skua from a population which breeds on the Chatham Islands, New Zealand. A large proportion of the Chatham Islands population breed in communal groups. Each communal group was shown to be comprised of a single female and two or more males. Consequently, the overall sex ratio amongst breeding birds was biased, with almost twice the number of males as females. In contrast the sex ratio amongst fledgling chicks did not differ significantly from 1:1. The patterns of reproductive success in breeding pairs and communal groups of the brown skua from the Chatham Islands population were determined using multilocus DNA fingerprinting. Sixteen breeding groups were examined, the parentage of 45 chicks produced over three breeding seasons was established using the probes 33.15 and 33.6. No evidence was found of either extra-pair paternity or extra-group fertilisation and there was no evidence of egg dumping by females in any breeding group. These results suggest that long-term banding records for breeding pairs and communal groups accurately reflect the overall reproductive success of these individual groups. In addition, preliminary band sharing analysis indicated that adult members of communal groups were not closely related. These findings are also supported by banding records and are in contrast to the findings of the majority of communally breeding species studied. In the 10 communally breeding groups examined, multiple paternity within a clutch was recorded on two of the 12 occasions in which two chicks were reared. Furthermore, analysis of parentage of the chicks belonging to communal groups in which the adults had remained unchanged for two or more seasons showed that some males had variable reproductive success in different seasons. These records suggest that estimates of reproductive success of individuals based on a single season's data can be misleading. Should temporal changes in paternity (and/or maternity) be shown to be common phenomena in other species, this would have major implications for the interpretation of many parentage studies. The explanation of altruistic behaviour is one of the central issues in contemporary evolutionary theory and behavioural ecology. One of the best known examples of apparent altruism is the helping behaviour which occurs in communal breeding groups such as those found in the brown skua. Within these groups individuals often help to raise offspring which are not their own. This behaviour is an apparent enigma in a world in which organisms are assumed to act in a selfish manner. Consequently, this behaviour has become a focal example at the centre of much evolutionary debate. A variety of theories have been suggested to explain helping behaviour, the most recent is that helping is an unselected consequence of the evolution of communal breeding. This hypothesis is discussed in relation to the recent literature and it is concluded that it does little to advance the current debate. An alternative theoretical approach to helping behaviour is outlined. In conclusion the general findings from the investigation of communal breeding in the brown skua are summarised and these findings are discussed. Finally, possible areas of future research are outlined.</field><field name="date">1993</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270500 Zoology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2269</field></doc></add>
