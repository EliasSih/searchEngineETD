Diet is a recognised precursor of fatness, and current evidence supports the premise that in Westernised countries, the dietary intakes of children are likely to be important in obesity genesis.  However, we have a relatively poor understanding of the environments in which a child&#146;s eating is learnt and maintained.  Much of the existing work in this area is based on small-scale or experimental studies, or has been derived from homogeneous populations within the USA.  Despite these limitations, there is evidence that aspects of the child&#146;s family environment are likely to be important in determining obesity risk in children.

This thesis examines the impact of the family food environment on a child&#146;s eating through two related studies.  The first study, titled the Children and Family Eating (CAF&#201;) study comprised three phases.  Phase one involved qualitative interviews with 17 parents of 5-6 year-old children to explore parental perceptions regarding those factors in a child&#146;s environment believed to influence the development of their child&#146;s eating habits.  These interviews were used to inform the development of quantitative measures of the family food environment.   The second phase involved the development of a Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) to assess dietary intake in 5-6 year-olds.  The FFQ was informed by analysis of 1995 Australian National Nutrition Survey data.  In the final phase the relationships between dietary intakes of 5-6 year-old children, and potential predictors of dietary intake were examined in a cross-sectional study of 560 families.  Predictors included measures of: parental perceptions of the adequacy of their child&#146;s diet; food availability and accessibility; child-feeding; the opportunities for parental modelling of food intake; a child&#146;s television exposure; maternal Body Mass Index; and maternal education.   Analysis of the CAF&#201; data provides unique information regarding the relationships between a child&#146;s family food environment and their food consumption.   Models developed for a range of dietary outcomes considered to be predictive of increased risk for obesity, including total energy and fat intakes, vegetable variety, vegetable consumption, and high-energy (non-dairy) fluid consumption, explained between 11 and 20 percent of the variance in dietary intake.  Two aspects of the family food environment, parental perception of a child&#146;s dietary adequacy, and the total minutes of television viewed per day, were frequently found to be predictive of dietary outcomes likely to promote fatness in these children.

The second study, titled the Parent Education and Support (PEAS) Feeding Intervention Study, was a prospective pre/post non-randomised intervention trial that assessed the impact of a feeding intervention to 240 first-time mothers of one-year-old children.  This intervention focused on one aspect of the family food environment, child-feeding, which has been proposed as influential in the development of obesogenic eating behaviours.  In this study, Maternal and Child Health Nurses (MCHNs), using a &#145;Division of Responsibility&#146; model of feeding, taught parents to provide nutritious food at regular intervals and to let children decide if to eat and how much to eat.  Thus parents were encourages to food their child without exerting pressure, or employing coercion or rewards (controlling behaviours).  The aim was to influence parental attitudes and beliefs regarding child-feeding.  Through the use of these feeding techniques, this intervention also aimed to increase the variety of fruits and vegetables a child consumed by teaching parents to persist with offering these foods, over the year of the intervention, in non-emotive environments.  Fruits and vegetables were chosen in this intervention because they are likely to be protective in the development of obesity.  Analysis of the PEAS data suggests that this low-level feeding intervention, delivered through existing Maternal and Child Health services, was modestly effective in changing parental attitudes and beliefs regarding the feeding of young children.  Further, the validity of fruits offered to intervention group children increased.

This thesis expands the existing knowledge base by providing a comprehensive analysis of the relative impact of aspects of the family environment on dietary intakes of 5-6 year-olds.  Further, the analysis of a feeding intervention in first-time parents provides important insights regarding the potential to influence child-feeding and the impact this may have on the promotion of eating behaviours protective against obesity.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">childrens nutrition</field><field name="subject">infants nutritions</field><field name="subject">obesity in children</field><field name="subject">chilren's eating</field><field name="subject">food environments</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20061207.120915</field></doc><doc><field name="title">African heart, eastern mind: the transcendent experience through improvised music</field><field name="creator">Vincs, Robert</field><field name="description">[No Abstract]</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">philosophy</field><field name="subject">transendence</field><field name="subject">jazz improvisation</field><field name="subject">music</field><field name="subject">african music</field><field name="subject">music influence</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20061207.121703</field></doc><doc><field name="title">complexity, age and motor competence effects on fine motor kinematics</field><field name="creator">Lavelle, Barbara M</field><field name="description">Prehension is a fundamental skill usually performed as part of a complex action sequence in everyday tasks.  Using an information processing framework, these studies examined the effects of task complexity, defined by the number of component movement elements (MEs), on performance of prehension tasks.  Of interest was how motor control and organisation might be influenced by age and/or motor competence.  Three studies and two longitudinal case studies examined kinematic characteristics of prehension tasks involving one-, two- and three-MEs: reach and grasp (low-complexity); reach, grasp and object placement (moderate-complexity); and reach, grasp and double placement of object (high-complexity).

A pilot study established the suitability of tasks and procedures for children aged 5-, 8- and 11-years and showed that responses to task complexity and object size manipulations were sensitive to developmental changes, with increasing age associated with faster movements.  Study 2 explored complexity and age effects further for children aged 6- and 11-years and adults.  Increasing age was associated with shorter and less variable movement times (MTs) and proportional deceleration phases (%DTs) across all MEs.  Task complexity had no effect on simple reaction time (SRT), suggesting that there may be little preprogramming of movements beyond the first ME. In addition, MT was longer and more on-line corrections were evident for the high- compared to the moderate-complexity task for ME1.  Task complexity had a greater influence on movements in ME2 and ME3 than ME1.  Adults, but not children, showed task specific adaptations in ME2.

Study 3 examined performance of children with different levels of motor competence aged between 5- and 10-years.  Increasing age was associated with shorter SRTs, and MTs for ME1 only.  A decrease in motor competence was associated with greater difficulty in planning and controlling movements as indicated by longer SRTs, higher %DTs and more on-line corrections, especially in ME2.  Task complexity affected movements in all MEs, with a greater influence on ME1 compared to Study 2.  Findings also indicated that performance in MEs following prehension may be especially sensitive to motor competence effects on movement characteristics.  Case studies for two children at risk of Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD) revealed two different patterns of performance change over a 16-17 month period, highlighting the heterogeneous nature of DCD.  Overall, findings highlighted age-related differences, and the role of motor competence, in the ability to adapt movements to task specific requirements.  Results are useful in guiding movement education programmes for children with both age-appropriate and lower levels of motor competence.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">motor ability in children</field><field name="subject">human mechanics</field><field name="subject">motor ability</field><field name="subject">fine motor kinematics</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20061207.122512</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Guideline-based programs in the treatment of complex PTSD</field><field name="creator">Connor, Pamela K</field><field name="description">The term &#147;post-traumatic stress disorder&#148; (PTSD) is a relatively new diagnostic label, being formally recognized in 1980 in the Diagnostic Statistical Manual for Psychiatric Illness &#150; Third Edition (DSM-III) of the American Psychiatric Association (APA, 1980). Complex Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (CP) is a more recently discussed, and newly-classified, phenomenon, initially discussed in the early 1990s (Herman, 1992a). Thus, as research into effective treatments for CP is sparse, the treatment of CP is the topic of this study, in which a guideline-based treatment program developed by the researcher for the treatment of CP is implemented and evaluated. 

Ten individuals participated in this study, undertaking individualized, guideline-based treatment programs spanning a period of six months. In providing background information relevant to this study, an explanation is provided regarding the nature of CP, and the reasons for its consideration as a separate phenomenon to PTSD. The adequacy of the PTSD formulation in enabling effective assessment and treatment of CP is also explored, with endorsement of previous researchers&#146; conclusions that the CP construct is more useful than the PTSD construct for assessing and treating survivors of long-term and multiple forms of abuse.  The PTSD classification is restrictive, and not necessarily appropriate for certain forms of trauma (such as prolonged trauma, or multiple forms of trauma), as such trauma experiences may lead to specific effects that lay outside those formerly associated with PTSD.  Such effects include alterations in affect regulation, consciousness, self-perception, interpersonal relationships, and in systems of meaning.  

Following discussion regarding the PTSD/CP classification, an examination of treatment methods currently used in the treatment of PTSD, and a review of treatment outcome studies, takes place. The adequacy of primary treatment methods in treating CP symptoms is then examined, with the conclusion that a range of treatment methods could potentially be useful in the treatment of CP symptoms. Individuals with a diagnosis of CP may benefit from the adoption of an eclectic approach, drawing on different treatment options for different symptoms, and constantly evaluating client progress and re-evaluating interventions. 

This review of treatment approaches is followed by details of an initial study undertaken to obtain feedback from individuals who had suffered long-term/multiple trauma and who had received treatment.  Participants in this initial study were asked open-ended questions regarding the treatment approach they had experienced, the most useful aspect of the treatment, the least useful aspect, and other strategies/treatment approaches that may have been useful &#150; but which were not used. The feedback obtained from these individuals was used to inform the development of treatment guidelines for use in the main study, as were recommendations made by Chu (1998).  The predominant focus of the treatment guidelines was &#147;ego strengthening&#148;, a term coined by Chu (1998) to describe the &#147;initial (sometimes lengthy) period of developing fundamental skills in maintaining supportive relationships, developing self-care strategies, coping with symptomatology, improving functioning, and establishing a positive self 
identity&#148; (p.75). 

Using a case study approach, data are then presented relating to each of the ten individuals involved in the treatment program: details of his/her trauma experience(s)and the impact of the trauma (as perceived by each individual); details of each individual&#146;s treatment program (as planned, and as implemented); post-treatment evaluation of the positive and negative aspects of the treatment program (from the therapist&#146;s perspective); and details of the symptoms reported by the individual post-treatment, via psychometric assessment and also during interview. Analysis and discussion of the data relating to the ten participants in the study are the focal point of this study.  The evaluation of the effectiveness of each individual&#146;s treatment has been based predominantly on qualitative data, obtained from an analysis of language (discourse analysis) used by participants to describe their symptoms pre- and post-treatment.  Both blatant and subtle changes in the language used by participants to describe themselves, their behaviour, and their relationships pre- and post-treatment have provided an insight into the possible changes that occurred as a result of the treatment program. The language used by participants has been a rich source of data, one that has enabled the researcher to obtain information that could not be obtained using psychometric assessment methods. Most of the participants in this study portrayed notable changes in many of the CP symptoms, including being more stable and having improved capacity to explore their early abuse.  

Although no direct cause-effect relationship between the participants&#146; treatment program and the improvements described can be established from this study, the participants&#146; perception that the program assisted them with their symptoms, and reported many aspects of &#147;ego strengthening&#148;, is of major importance. Such self-perception of strength and empowerment is important if an individual is going to be able to deal with past trauma experiences. In fact, abreactive work may have a greater chance of succeeding if those who have experienced long-term or multiple trauma are feeling more empowered, and more stable, as were the participants in this study (post-intervention).

 In concluding this study, recommendations have been made in regard to the use of guideline-based treatment programs in the responsible treatment of CP.  Strengths and limitations of this study have also been highlighted, and recommendations have been made regarding possibilities for future research related to CP treatment. On the whole, this study has supported strongly other research that highlights the importance of focusing on &#147;ego strengthening&#148; in assisting those who have suffered long-term/multiple trauma experiences.  Thus, a guideline-based program focusing on assisting sufferers of long-term trauma with some, or all, of the symptoms of CP, is recommended as an important first stage of any treatment of individuals who have experienced long-term/multiple trauma, allowing them to develop the emotional and psychological strength required to deal with past traumatic events.  Clinicians who are treating patients whose history depicts long-term or multiple trauma experiences (either from their childhood, or at some stage in their adult life) need, therefore, to be mindful of assessing individuals for symptoms of CP &#150; so that they can treat these symptoms prior to engaging in any work associated directly with the past traumatic experiences.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">PTSD</field><field name="subject">post-traumatic stress disorder</field><field name="subject">psychotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20061207.123317</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Emotional habituation to filmed violence employing the startle probe response</field><field name="creator">White, Melissa Lee</field><field name="description">This thesis reports on research examining the habituation of emotional variables to filmed violence.  The following subjective emotional variables were assessed: positive feelings, anxiety, disgust, entertainment and anger.  In addition, an objective measure of emotional response was recorded physiologically, using the startle eyeblink response.  The mediating influence of personality, individual differences and contextual features on an individuals&#146; perception of and reaction to filmed violence were also explored.

Study one was exploratory in nature served to identify and select the film stimuli to be employed in the subsequent studies.  The primary aim of the study was to allow for the identification of violent stimuli considered to be most socially and culturally relevant.  The present research builds on existing scientific literature which has began to appreciate that differences in the context of a portrayal holds important implications for its impact on viewers.  Thus, a secondary and more specific desire of study one was to obtain an evaluation of the contextual features of the violent film segments.  A sample of 30 participants viewed and rated the film stimuli on the variables of realism, fantasy and violence.  From this exploratory study four violent film stimuli were subsequently employed.

Study 2 used the eyeblink startle response proposed by Vrana, Spence and Lang (1988) to explore the habituation of emotional variables to a realistic depiction of filmed violence.  Emotional response was assessed both objectively, using the eyeblink startle response and subjectively through individuals self-reports.  In addition the study investigated the significance of individual differences as mediators of emotional response.  Questionnaire and physiological data were obtained from 30 participants.  Overall, repeated exposure to filmed violence resulted in a decline in both objective and subjective emotional response.  Differences were identified in the manner in which men and women responded to the film.  Women reacted initially and over time with more intense physiological and psychological reactions to the violent film than males.  Specifically, men displayed more curiosity and reported greater entertainment and positive feelings in response to the film, whilst women found the violence more disgusting and reported higher levels of anger and anxiety.  It was found that the eyeblink startle magnitude paralleled the subjective emotional processing of the violent film, thus providing further confirmatory evidence of its validity in the investigation of emotional reactions to a stimulus.  Personality factors were found to mediate emotional response to filmed violence, with neuroticism most powerfully implicated.  High levels of neuroticism were found to be associated with greater anger and anxiety and less positive feelings whilst viewing violent film.  A high score on extraversion was correlated with higher levels of anger and lower levels of curiosity and entertainment.

Whilst the aims of study 3 were identical to that of study 2, a variation in the contextual feature of the violent film stimuli under investigation was the distinguishing and pertinent feature.  Study 2 provided data on the habituation of emotional response to a realistic depiction of filmed violence.  Study 3 was concerned with emotional response over repeated exposure to a fantasized violent depiction.  Therefore, allowing for a comparison regarding the effects of context on emotional response.  The results of study 3, with respect to habituation of emotional response, personality and individual differences, were similar to that obtained in study 2.  A comparison of the two studies, however, revealed that individuals responded significantly different to the contextual features of the violent portrayal.  Compared to the fantasised portrayal the realistic film stimulus was reported to be more digusting, anxiety provoking and less entertaining.  In addition, and not surprisingly respondents reported that the realistic portrayal resulted in the production of more anger and less positive feelings.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">violence in mass media</field><field name="subject">startle probe response</field><field name="subject">habituation</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20061207.131711</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Predicting the resistance of fired clay bricks to salt attack</field><field name="creator">Burgess-Dean, Leon Sylvester</field><field name="description">The salt attack of Fired Clay Bricks (FCBs) causes surface damage that is aesthetically displeasing and eventually leads to structural damage.  Methods for determining the resistances of FCBs to salt weathering have mainly tried to simulate the process by using accelerating aging tests.  Most research in this area has concentrated on the types of salt that can cause damage and the damage that occurs during accelerated aging tests.  This approach has lead to the use of accelerated aging tests as standard methods for determining resistance.  Recently, it has been acknowledged that are not the most reliable way to determine salt attack resistance for all FCBs in all environments.  Few researchers have examined FCBs with the aim of determining which material and mechanical properties make a FCB resistant to salt attack.  The aim of this study was to identify the properties that were significant to the resistance of FCBs to salt attack.  In doing so, this study aids in the development of a better test method to assess the resistance of FCBs to salt attack.

The current Australian Standard accelerated aging test was used to measure the resistance of eight FCBs to salt attack using sodium sulfate and sodium chloride.  The results of these tests were compared to the water absorption properties and the total porosity of FCBs.  An empirical relationship was developed between the twenty-four-hour water absorption value and the number of cycles to failure from sodium sulfate tests.  The volume of sodium chloride solution was found to be proportional to the total porosity of FCBs in this study.  A phenomenological discussion of results led to a new mechanism being presented to explain the derivation of stress during salt crystallisation of anhydrous and hydratable salts.

The mechanical properties of FCBs were measured using compression tests.  FCBs were analysed as cellular materials to find that the elastic modules of FCBs was equivalent for extruded FCBs that had been fired a similar temperatures and time.  Two samples were found to have significantly different elastic moduli of the solid microstructure.  One of these samples was a pressed brick that was stiffer due to the extra bond that is obtained during sintering a closely packed structure.  The other sample was an extruded brick that had more firing temperature and time compared with the other samples in this study.

A non-destructive method was used to measure the indentation hardness and indentation stress-strain properties of FCBs.  The indentation hardness of FCBs was found to be proportional to the uniaxial compression strength.  In addition, the indentation hardness had a better linear correlation to the total porosity of FCBs except for those samples that had different elastic moduli of the solid microstructure.

Fractography of exfoliated particles during salt cycle tests and compression tests showed there was a similar pattern of fracture during each failure.  The results indicate there were inherent properties of a FCB that determines the size and shape of fractured particles during salt attack.  The microstructural variables that determined the fracture properties of FCBs were shown to be important variables to include in future models that attempt to estimate the resistance of FCBs to salt attack.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">bricks</field><field name="subject">fired clay bricks</field><field name="subject">salt attack</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20061207.132458</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Community school teacher education and the construction of pedagogical discourse in Papua New Guinea</field><field name="creator">Pickford, Steven</field><field name="description">Pedagogical discourse in Papua New Guinea (PNG) community schooling is mediated by a western styles education.  The daily administration and organisation of school activity, graded teaching and learning, subject selection, content boundaries, teaching and assessment methods are all patterned after western schooling.  This educational settlement is part of a legacy of German, British and Australian government and non-government colonialism that officially came to an end in 1975.  Given the colonial heritage of schooling in PNG, this study is interested in exploring particular aspects of the degree of mutuality between local discourses and the discourses of a western styled pedagogy in post-colonial times, for the purpose of better informing community school teacher education practices.

This research takes place at and in the vicinity of Madang Teachers College, a pre-service community school teachers college on the north coast of Papua New Guinea.  The research was carried out in the context of the researcher&#146;s employment as a contract lecturer in the English language Department between 1991-1993.  As an in-situ study it was influenced by the roles of different participants and the circumstances in which data was gathered and constituted, data which was compatible with participants commitments to community school teacher education and community school teaching and learning.

In the exploration of specific pedagogic practices different qualitative research approaches and perspectives were brought to bear in ways best suited to the circumstances of the practice.  In this way analytical foci were more dictated by circumstances rather by design.  The analytical approach is both a hermeneutic one where participants&#146; activities are &#145;read like texts&#146;, where what is said or written is interpreted against the background of other informing contexts and texts, to better understand how understandings and meanings are produced and circulated; and also a phenomenological one where participants&#146; perspectives are sought to better understand how pedagogical discursive formations are assimilated with the &#145;self&#146;.  The effect of shifting between these approaches throughout the study is to build up a sense of co-authorship between researcher and participants in relation to particular aspects of the research.

The research explores particular sites where pedagogic discourse is produced, re-produced, distributed, articulated, consumed and contested, and in doing so seeks to better understand what counts as pedagogical discourse.  These are sites that are largely unexplored in these terms, in the academic literature on teacher education and community schooling in PNG.  As such, they represent gaps in what is documented and understood about the nature of post-colonial pedagogy and teacher training.  The first site is a grade two community school class involved in the teaching and early learning of English as the &#145;official&#146; language of instruction.  Here local discourses of solidarity and agreement are seen to be mobilised to make meaningful, what are for the teacher and children moments in their construction as post-colonial subjects.  What in instructional terms may be seen as an English language lesson becomes, in the light of the research perspectives used, an exercise in the structuring of new social identities, relations and knowings, problematising autonomous views of teaching and learning.  The second site explores this issue of autonomous (decontextualised) teaching and learning through an investigation of student teachers&#146; epistemological contextualisations of knowledge, teaching and learning.  What is examined is the way such orientations are constructed in terms of &#145;traditional&#146; and &#145;modern&#146; epistemological and pedagogical alignments, and, in terms of differently conceived notions of community, in a problematisation of the notion of community schooling.

The third and fourth sites examine reflective accounts of student teachers&#146; pedagogic practices, understandings and subjectivities as they confront the moral and political economies and cultural politics of schooling in School Experiences and Practicum contexts, and show how dominant behaviourist and &#145;rational/autonomous&#146; conceptions of what counts as teaching and learning are problematised in the way some students teachers draw upon wider social discourses to construct a dialogue with learners.  The final site is a return to the community school where the discourse of school reports through which teachers, children and parents are constructed as particular subjects of schooling, are explored.  Here teachers report children&#146;s progress over a four year period and parents write back in conforming, confronting and contesting ways, in the midst of the ongoing enculturation of their children.  In this milieu, schooling is shown to be a provider of differentiated social qualifications rather than a socially just and relevant education.

Each of the above-mentioned studies form part of a research and pedagogic interest in understanding the &#145;disciplining&#146; effects of schooling upon teacher education, the particular consequences of those effects, what is embraces, resisted and hidden.  Each of the above sites is informed by various &#145;intertexts&#146;.  The use of intertexts is designed to provide a multiplicity of views, actions and voices while enhancing the process of cross-cultural reading through contextualising the studies in ways that reveal knowledges and practices which are often excluded in more conventional accounts of teaching and learning.

This research represents a journey, but not an aimless one.  It is one which reads the ideological messages of coherence, impartiality and moral soundness of western pedagogical discourse against the school experiences of student-teachers, teachers, children and parents, in post-colonial Papua New Guinea, and finds them lacking.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">teachers</field><field name="subject">training teachers</field><field name="subject">community schools</field><field name="subject">papua new guinea</field><field name="subject">teacher education</field><field name="subject">pedagogical discourse in Papua New Guinea</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20061207.133309</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Spatial and temporal disparaties in aurally aided visual search</field><field name="creator">Griffiths, Shaaron S</field><field name="description">Research over the last decade has shown that auditorily cuing the location of visual targets reduces the time taken to locate and identify targets for both free-field and virtually presented sounds.  The first study conducted for this thesis confirmed these findings over an extensive region of free-field space.  However, the number of sound locations that are measured and stored in the data library of most 3-D audio spatial systems is limited, so that there is often a discrepancy in position between the cued and physical location of the target.  Sampling limitations in the systems also produce temporal delays in which the stored data can be conveyed to operators.  To investigate the effects of spatial and temporal disparities in audio cuing of visual search, and to provide evidence to alleviate concerns that psychological research lags behind the capabilities to design and implement synthetic interfaces, experiments were conducted to examine (a) the magnitude of spatial separation, and (b) the duration of temporal delay that intervened between auditory spatial cues and visual targets to alter response times to locate targets and discriminate their shape, relative to when the stimuli were spatially aligned, and temporally synchronised, respectively.  Participants listened to free-field sound localisation cues that were presented with a single, highly visible target that could appear anywhere across 360&#176; of azimuthal space on the vertical mid-line (spatial separation), or extended to 45&#176; above and below the vertical mid-line (temporal delay).  A vertical or horizontal spatial separation of 40&#176; between the stimuli significantly increased response times, while separations of 30&#176; or less did not reach significance.  Response times were slowed at most target locations when auditory cues occurred 770 msecs prior to the appearance of targets, but not with similar durations of temporal delay (i.e., 440 msecs or less).  When sounds followed the appearance of targets, the stimulus onset asynchrony that affected response times was dependent on target location, and ranged from 440 msecs at higher elevations and rearward of participants, to 1,100 msecs on the vertical mid-line.  If targets appeared in the frontal field of view, no delay of acoustical stimulation affected performance.  Finally, when conditions of spatial separation and temporal delay were combined, visual search times were degraded with a shorter stimulus onset asynchrony than when only the temporal relationship between the stimuli was varied, but responses to spatial separation were unaffected.  The implications of the results for the development of synthetic audio spatial systems to aid visual search tasks was discussed.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">visual perception</field><field name="subject">auditory perception</field><field name="subject">space perception</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20061207.134032</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Beyond Abrahamism: A fresh reading of the Tanakh traditions respecting Lot, Moab and Ammon</field><field name="creator">Tonson, Paul David</field><field name="description">At the heart of this study is my interest in the way in which a religious community establishes its sense of identity and its boundaries in relation to other groups. I explore the case of Israel's attitude towards her eastern neighbours, the Moabites and Ammonites, as portrayed in Tanakh, the Hebrew Bible.  Most commentary from the last one hundred years privileges one particular view of Moab and Ammon as traditional enemies of Israel.  I aim to show the validity of readings of the biblical accounts that reveal a more complex relationship between Israel and her neighbours.  Tanakh exhibits a dialectic between eirenic and hostile viewpoints.   
The stories of Abraham and Lot, who are presented as ancestors of Israel and of Moab and Ammon, to some degree represent Israel&#146;s understanding of her neighbours.  Conventional commentaries take for granted the accepted orthodoxy of Judaism, Christianity and Islam concerning Abraham and his significance in terms of faith and righteousness and blessing and covenant.  As none of these notions is specifically linked to Lot at any point, he is treated as a pathetic figure and remains secondary in conventional commentary.  Many commentaries denigrate the character of Lot, often in direct comparisons with Abraham.  My reading of the texts of Genesis attempts to free the story of Lot from the constraints imposed by the way the story of Abraham functions.  A careful reading of the Genesis account shows that Lot and Abraham exhibit similar elements of moral ambiguity, and Genesis contains no statement that condemns Lot on moral or religious grounds.
Genesis 19, the single narrative in which Lot appears independently of Abraham, participates in the dialectic elsewhere in Tanakh.  On the basis of a consistent pattern of action and speech throughout the first portion of Genesis 19, I advance my own original conception of the eirenic viewpoint of the narrator concerning Lot and his relationship to the divine.  I attempt to demonstrate ways in which the story of Lot critiques or deconstructs the dominant ideology centred upon Abraham.  My conception of the particular interests of the compiler of Genesis 19 is supported by several intertextual studies.  These include the traditions of Sodom and of Zoar, the story of hospitality in Judges 19, the story of the deluge (Genesis 6-9) and stories of women who, like Lot&#146;s daughters, act to continue the family line. 
In a treatment of the history of Lot traditions, I find evidence to separate the story of Lot from the work of the Yahwist.  I consider whether the stories of Lot have a derivation east of the Jordan and whether the stories were of particular interest to the Deuteronomists. 
In the final chapter of this study, I focus on the main themes of the narratives concerning Lot and Abraham, and Moab and Ammon and Israel.  The question of social boundaries arises in regard to many of these themes, such as the interaction of female and male, the role of wealth, the relation of city and country, kinship, and rights to land settlement.  In this way, the treatment of Lot and Abraham in Tanakh and in subsequent traditions offers a perspective upon the formation of identity in the contemporary world of religious plurality.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Abraham</field><field name="subject">Talmud</field><field name="subject">Bible</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20061207.140407</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Associations between growth and diet in adolescence</field><field name="creator">Conn, Jennifer</field><field name="description">There is much interest in the nature and quality of the diet consumed by adolescents.  To determine whether there are significant associations between diet and gain in height and weight in this age group, the present study analysed data on food intake and weight and height obtained on three occasions over a 30-month period from a total of 326 adolescents aged between 12 and 15 years.  Information on sociodemographic and other lifestyle factors, including an indicator of physical activity, was also obtained.

Energy intake was found to be a significant positive predictor of both height and weight gain.  In addition intake of fat, calcium and riboflavin were found to be significant positive predicators of height gain and intake of carbohydrate and starch significant positive predictors of weight gain.  After controlling for energy intake only riboflavin approached significance as a positive predictor of height gain.  A food group analysis identified intake of dairy foods as a significant predictor of height gain.  Although statistically significant the dietary predictors explained only a small proportion of the variability in height and weight (&#8804;3.5%).

Given the difficulties in obtaining complete dietary records from this age group and the generally adequate nature of the diet in the study group, the small proportion of height and weight gain explained by diet is not unexpected.  Nevertheless the nutrient predictors identified are consistent with nutrient requirements for growth during adolescence and highlight the importance, for this age group, of an adequate intake of nutrients specifically provided by dairy foods.

Few significant associations were found between growth rates and the sociodemographic and the lifestyle factors measured in this study.  The ethnic diversity of the study sample may have contributed to this outcome.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">teenagers</field><field name="subject">dairy</field><field name="subject">dairy products in human nutrition</field><field name="subject">youth</field><field name="subject">growth</field><field name="subject">diet in adolescence</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20061207.141236</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Chiral organotin hydrides as enantioselective reducing agents</field><field name="creator">Dunn, Kerri</field><field name="description">This thesis reports on the feasibility of the utilization of organotin hydrides as enaantioselective free radical reducing agents.  The chiral organotin hydrides prepared contain the bulky chiral (1R,2S,5R)-menthyl substituent and in some cases also contain a stereogenic tin centre.  Reaction of (1R,2S,5R)-menthylmagnesium chloride (MenMgC1) with triphenyltin chloride in THF proceeds with epimerization of the C-1 carbon of the menthyl group and results in a mixture of (1R,2S,5R)-menthyltriphenyltin and (1S,2S.5R)-menthyltriphenyltin.  Addition of Lewis bases such as triphenylphosphine to the THF solution of triphenyltin chloride prior to the addition of the Grignard reagent suppresses epimerization and enables isolation of pure (1R,2S,5R)-menthyltriphenyltin.  (1R,2S,5R)-Menthyltriphenyltin is the precursor for the synthesis of (1R,2S,5R)-menthyldiphenyltin hydride as well as (1R,2S,5R)-menthyl-containing organotin halide derivatives.  A crystal structure of (1R,2S,5R)-menthylphenyltin dibromide and (1R,2S,5R)-menthylphenyltin dichloride confirmed the configuration of the menthyl substituent in these compounds.

Reaction of MenMgC1 with diphenyltin dichloride in THF proceeds with no epimerization of the C-1 carbon of the menthyl group and bis((1R,2S,5R)-menthyl)diphenyltin is formed.  A crystal structure of (1R,2S,5R)-menthyltriphenyltin confirmed the configuration of the menthyl substituent.  Bis((1R,2S,5R)-menthyl)diphenyltin is used to form bis((1R,2S,5R)-menthyl)phenyltin hydride as well as other bis(1R,2S,5R)-menthyl derivatives.

A series of chiral non-racemic triorganotin halides and triorganotin hydrides containing one or two (1R,2S,5R)-menthyl substituents as well as various potentially intramolecular coordination substituents were synthesized and characterized.  The intramolecular substituents include the 8-(dimethylamino)naphthyl, 2-[(1S)-1-dimethylaminoethyl]phenyl, 2-(4,4-dimethyl-2-oxazoline)-5-methylphenyl and the 2-(4-(S)isopropyl-2-oxazoline)-5-methylphenyl substituents.

Each compound containing a stereogenic tin centre was synthesized as diastereomeric mixtures.  AM1 calculations of these compounds provide good qualitative predictability of the molecular geometries observed in the solid state as well as the diastereomeric ratios observed in solution.  X-ray analysis of some of the organotin halides containing intramolecular coordination substituents revealed a tendency towards penta-coordination at the tin centre as a result of N-Sn interactions.

The chiral organotin hydrides synthesized were found to be poor enantioselective free radical reducing agents.  However, the addition of one molar equivalent of achiral or chiral Lewis acids to the free radical reduction reactions involving these organotin hydrides results in remarkable increases in enantioselectivity.  There are numerous examples in which enantioselectivities exceed 80% and three examples of enantioselectivites which are equal and above 90% with one outstanding enantioselective outcome of &#8805;99%.  These results appear to be the highest enantioselectivites for organotin hydride radical reductions reported to date.

There is strong evidence to suggest that the chiral menthyl group of the organotin hydride directs the stereochemical outcome in the reduced product.  The results also suggest that an increase in the number of menthyl substituents attached to tin or the introduction of intramolecular coordination substituents does not necessarily results in a greater increase in enantioselectivity.

Preliminary studies into the synthesis of organotin hydrides containing Lewis acid functionalities are also reported.  A zirconium chloride functionality was found to be incompatible with organotin hydride.  However, an organotin hydride containing a trialkylboron Lewis acid functionality attached via an alkyl chain was successfully synthesized.  Although this reagent was only stable in the preparative THF solution, it was still found to be effective at reducing benzaldehyde to benzyl alcohol.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">organotin compounds</field><field name="subject">chirality</field><field name="subject">free radicals</field><field name="subject">pharmaceutical chemistry</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20061207.142326</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Metamemory training for memory disorders in adults with a closed head injury</field><field name="creator">Jagow, Marika</field><field name="description">The purpose of the present study was to investigate the efficacy of a memory and metamemory training program on memory performance and metamemory judgement accuracy in adults with a closed head injury.  A multiple baseline across subjects design was used with six subjects.  All subjects were seen at least two years post-injury.  Training included general metamemory information about the nature of memory, use of a specific memory strategy to assist verbal recall (to Preview, Question, Read, State and Test- PQRST), specific metamemory information about the strategy, and a self instruction procedure (WTSC- What is the task,  Select a strategy to use, Try out strategy, Check to evaluate strategy effectiveness).  During the training period all subjects recalled greater than fifty percent of paragraph ideas while using PQRST.  Follow-up tests showed that five of the six subjects maintained recall levels but a gradual decrease in slope was observed over eight weeks post-training.  Tests of recall, recognition and metamemory judgements on Sentence and Action Tasks were used to evaluate generalisation of training.  Two subjects showed improved recall and two subjects showed improved recognition performance.  In addition, four subjects demonstrated greater metamemory judgement accuracy about recognition performance following training.  Improved performance post-training was also observed for three subjects on the Rivermead Behavioral Memory Test and the Logical Memory subtest of the Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised, greater than that expected for repeated testing.

Reusability is achieved with a PDS design by relocating implicit control structures in the software and the storage of explicit data in database files.

This approach can accommodate various user requirements without tedious modification of the software.  In order to specify appropriate parameters in a system, knowledge of both business activities and system behaviour are required.  For large, complex software packages, this task becomes time consuming and requires specialist knowledge, yet the consistency and correctness still cannot be guaranteed.

My research studied the types of knowledge required and agents involved in the PDS customisation.  The work also identified the associated problems and constraints.  A solution is proposed and implemented as an Intelligent Assistant prototype than a manual approach.

Three areas of achievement have been highlighted:  1. The characteristics and problems of maintaining parameter instances in a PDS are defined.  It is found that the verification is not complete with the technical/structural knowledge alone, but a context is necessary to provide semantic information and related business activities (thus the implemented parameters) so that mainline functions can relate with each other.  2.  A knowledge-based modelling approach has been proposed and demonstrated via a practical implementation.  A Specification Language was designed which can model various types of knowledge in a PDS and encapsulate relationships.  The Knowledge-Based System (KBS) developed verifies parameters based on the interpreted model of a given context.  3. The performance of the Intelligent Assistant prototype was well received by the domain specialist from the participating organisation.  The modelling and KBS approach developed in my research offers considerable promise in solving practical problems in the software industry.</field><field name="date">1994</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">software systems</field><field name="subject">parameter-driven systems</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20061207.143623</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Lateral strength of zero bond masonry walls subjected to wind loads</field><field name="creator">Schulze, Peter</field><field name="description">Masonry walls are usually laid with the individual masonry units along a course overlapping units in the course below.  Commonly, the perpend joints in the course occur above the mid-points of the units below to form a &#145;half-bond&#146; or above a third point to form a &#145;third-bond&#146;.  The amount of this overlap has a profound influence on the strength of a wall supported on three or four sides, where lateral pressures from wind cause combined vertical and horizontal flexure.

Where masonry units are laid with mortar joints, the torsional shear bond resistance between the mortar and overlapping units largely determines the horizontal flexural strength.  If there is zero bond strength between units, then the horizontal flexural strength is derived from the frictional resistance to torsion on the overlapping bed-faces of the units.

This thesis reports a theoretical and experimental investigation into the frictional properties of overlapping units when subjected to combinations of vertical and horizontal moments and vertical axial compression.

These basic properties were used to develop a theory to predict the lateral strength of walls supported on two, three or four sides.  A plastic theory of behaviour was confirmed by experiment.  

The theory was then used to determine maximum unbraced panel sizes for particular boundary conditions.  Design charts were developed to determine temporary bracing requirements for panels during construction.</field><field name="date">1978</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">masonry</field><field name="subject">walls</field><field name="subject">strength</field><field name="subject">zero bond masonry</field><field name="subject">wind loads</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20061207.145433</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Gender and national identity: The people's theatre in the Philippines (1967-2000)</field><field name="creator">Teoh, Remedios A</field><field name="description">The Philippine Education Theater Association (PETA), the People&#146;s Theatre in the Philippines was founded within the bounds of the nationalist leftist tradition.

It is exacerbated by the inability of mothers to recognise threats to nutritional status and take corrective action.  Advice in &#145;Health Centres&#146; is often inaccessible to mothers.  The Traditional Birth Attendants (TBAs) work with pregnant women in local communities, and the purpose of this study was to develop and implement an educationprogram in growth monitoring and nutrition for the TBAs and then to evaluate its effects.  Twenty five TBAs from two peri-urban areas of Kitwe were enrolled in this pilot study and eighteen completed the program.

The researcher developed and taught a program to the TBAs over ten days.  A pretest was given before the teaching program to enable the researcher to obtain information about the knowledge and skills of the TBAs.  Following the teaching program the TBAs were re-tested, with the same questionnaire.  Focus groups were conducted to enable the TBA to provide information on the teaching materials and the education program.  The TBAs then returned to their communities and put into practice the skills and knowledge they had learned for six months.  Their practice was monitored by a trained Public Health Nurse.  The researcher also surveyed 38 pregnant women about their knowledge of growth monitoring and nutrition before the TBAs went into the field to work with their local communities.  The same questionnaire used with the pregnant women was administered to 38 new mothers with children aged 0 to 6 months to gain information of their knowledge and skills following the work of the TBAs.

The program was evaluated by assessing the extent to which TBAs knowledge and skills were increased, the knowledge and understanding of a selection of their clients and the rates of malnutrition of infants in the area under study.

The results from the research clearly indicated that the teaching program on growth monitoring and nutrition given to the selected group of TBAs had a positive effect on their knowledge and skills.  It was found that the teaching developed their knowledge, practical skills, evaluative skills.  That they were able to give infants&#146; mothers sound advice regarding their children&#146;s nutrition was revealed by the mother&#146;s increased knowledge and the decrease in numbers of malnourished children in the study areas at the conclusion of the research.

The major outcomes from the study are: that Zambian TBAs can be taught to carry out an expanded role; field experience is a key factor in the teaching program; making advice available in local communities is important; and preliminary data on the Zambian experience were generated.

Recommendations are: The pilot program should be expanded with continuing support from the Health Department.  Similar educational programs should be introduced into other areas of Zambia with support from the Ministry of Health.

That in administering a teaching program: Sufficient time must be allocated to practical work to allow poorly educated women to attain the basic skills needed to master the complex skills required to competently reduce faltering in their communities.  The teaching materials to illustrate nutritional principles for feeding programs must be developed to suite locally available foods and conditions.  Methods of teaching should suit the local area, for example, using what facilities are locally available.  The timing of the teaching program should be suitable for the TBAs to attend.  This may vary from area to area, for example it may be necessary to avoid times traditionally given to fetching water or working in the fields.  For similar reasons, the venue for the teaching program should be suitable to the TBAs.  The teachers should go into the TBAs&#146; community rather than causing disruption of the TBAs&#146; day by expecting them to go to the teacher.

Data should be collected from a larger group of TBAs and clients to enable sophisticated statistical analysis to complement data from this pilot program.

The TBAs should be given recognition for their work and achievement.  This is something which they asked for.  They do not ask for payment, rather acknowledgment through regular follow up and approbation.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">midwives</field><field name="subject">children</field><field name="subject">Zambia</field><field name="subject">traditional birth</field><field name="subject">monitoring growth</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20061207.151734</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of dietary constituents on coronary heart disease risk factors</field><field name="creator">Ashton, Emma Louise</field><field name="description">Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) is a major cause of death in Western countries.  Mediterranean and Asian populations have a lower risk of death from CHD compared to Westernised population, as do vegetarian versus omnivorous populations.  Dietary constituents of traditional diets consumed by these populations are thought to influence both the classical risk factors for CHD, and the more recently identified risk factors, such as oxidative modification of low density lipoprotein (LDL), LDL particle size, arterial compliance and haemostatic factors.  The aim of this thesis was to examine the effects of several food components, particularly soybean and monounsaturated fat (MUFA), on CHD risk factors through 3 carefully controlled dietary interventions, and a cross-sectional study.

A randomised crossover dietary intervention study was conducted in 42 healthy males to investigate the effect on CHD risk factors of replacing lean meat with tofu, a soybean product regularly consumed by Asian populations, while controlling all other dietary factors.  The tofu diet resulted in significantly lower total cholesterol and triacylglycerol levels compared to the lean meat diet, and LDL particles that were more resistant to in vitro oxidative modification.  However, insulin, fibrinogen, factor VII, and lipoprotein (a) were not significantly different on the 2 diets.

A postprandial study was subsequently conducted to investigate any acute effects of a tofu test meal on the oxidative modification of LDL in 16 male subjects.  There was no significant difference between the susceptibility of LDL to oxidative modification before and after the tofu meal.

Twenty eight healthy subjects completed a separate randomised crossover dietary intervention comparing a high MUFA fat diet, using an Australian high oleic sunflower oil, with a low fat, high carbohydrate diet on CHD risk factors.  The high MUFA oil diet significantly increased high density lipoprotein cholesterol compared to the low fat diet as well as producing LDL that were more resistant to oxidative modification.  Neither the size of the LDL particle nor arterial compliance were significantly different on the 2 diets.

Twelve matched pairs of vegetations and omnivores were also studies to compare the habitual diet of a low and higher risk population group, to compare their risk factors and identify dietary constituents that may explain the differences.  The vegetarians consumed less saturated fat (SFA) and dietary cholesterol while consuming more polyunsaturated fat, dietary fibre and vitamin E compared to omnivores.  The vegetarians had lower total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and triacylglycerol levels compared to the omnivores and had LDL particles that were more resistant to in vitro oxidation.

These findings contribute to our knowledge about the dietary constituents that can alter some CHD risk factors in healthy subjects, and which could reduce the risk of developing CHD.  Investigations in high risk groups might reveal even more benefits.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Coronary heart disease</field><field name="subject">prevention</field><field name="subject">risk factors</field><field name="subject">nutritional aspects</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20061207.153511</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Steroidogenesis in cultured mammalian glial cells</field><field name="creator">Schuliga, Michael</field><field name="description">A protocol for culturing mammalian type 1 astrocytic cells, using female post-natal rat cerebral cortical tissue, was established and refined for use in steroidogenic metabolic studies incorporating progestin radioisotopes.  Cultures were characterised for homogeneity using standard morphological and immunostaining techniques.  Qualitative and quantitative studies were conducted to characterise the progesterone (P) metabolic pathways present in astrocytes in vitro.  Of particular interest was the formation of the P metabolite, 5&#225;-pregnan-3&#225;-ol-20-one (THP).  THP is a GABA(A) receptor agonist, believed to play a vital role in neural functioning and CNS homeostasis.  One aim of this study was to observe any modulatory effects selected neuroactive ligands have on the conversion of P into THP, in an attempt to link astrocytic steroidogenesis with neuronal control.

In qualitative studies, chromatographic procedures were used to establish the progestin profile of cerebral cortical astrocytes.  Tritiated P, DHP (5&#225;-pregnan-3,20-dione) and THP incurbates were preliminary fractionated by either normal phase (NP) or reverse phase (RP) high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).  The radiometabolites associated with each fraction were further chromatographed, before and/or after chemical derivatistation, by the aforemention HPLC procedures and thin layer chromatography (TLC).  Steroid radiometabolites were tentatively identified by comparing their chromatographic mobility with authentic steroids.  The identity of the main putative 5&#225;-reduced P metabolities, DHP, THP and 5&#225;-pregnan-3&#225;,20&#225;-diol (20&#225;OH-THP) were further confirmed by isotopic dilution analysis.  Their conclusive identification, along with the tentative identification of 20&#225;-hydroxypreg-4-en-3-one (20&#225;OH-P) and 20&#225;-hydroxy-5&#225;-pregnan-3-one (20&#225;OH-DHP), verify the localisation of 5&#225;-reductase, 3&#225;-hydroxy steroif oxidoreductase (HSOR), and 20&#225;-HSOR activity in the cultured astrocytes utilised in this study programme.  Other minor metabolites detected were tentatively identified, including 5&#225;-pregnan-3&#225;,21-diol-20-one (THDoc), indicating the presence of 21-hydroxylase enzymatic activity.  THDoc, like THP, is a GABA(A) receptor agonist.  The chemical and physical characterisation of several yet unidentified progestin metabolites, associated with a highly polar RP HPLC fraction (designated RP peak 1*), indicate the presence of one or more extra hydroxylase enzymes.

Quantitative analysis included a preliminary study.  In this study, the percentage yields of radiometabolites formed in cultures incubated with increasing substrate concentrations of (3)H-P for 24 hours were determined.  At the lower concentrations examined (ie 0.5 to 50nM), the metabolites associated with the polar RP HPLC fraction (RP peak 1*) collectively have the highest percentage yield.  They are subsequently considered metabolic end products of degradative catabolic P pathways.  The percentage yield of THP peaks in the medium concentration ranges (ie 5 to 500nM), whereas DHP remains fairly static at a low level with increasing concentration.  Both DHP and THP are considered metabolic pathway intermediates.  The percentage yield of 20&#225;OH-THP continues to increase with increasing concentration over 5nM, superseding THP approaching the highest concentration examined (5000nM).  This indicated the formation of 20&#225;OH-THP does not occur entirely via THP.  20&#225;OH-THP also possibly serves as the direct intermediate in the formation of the main radiometabolites associated with RP peak 1*.

A time/yield study incorporating incubation times from one to 24 hours was also conducted.  The full array of radiometabolites (individually or in groups) formed in astrocyte cultures incubated with 50nM tritiated P, DHP of THP, were assayed.  Cultures were observed to rapidly convert any DHP into THP, showing astrocytic 3&#225;-HSOR activity is very high.  The study also showed 5&#225;-reduction (ie the conversation of P into DHP) is the rate limiting reaction in the two step conversion of P into THP.  5&#225;-Reduction also appears to be a rate limiting step in the formation of 20&#225;-hydroxylated metabolites in astrocytes.  Cultures incubated with the tritiated 5&#225;-reduced pregnanes from one to four hours form greater quantities to 20&#225;-hydroxylated radiometabolites compared to cultures incubated with (3)H-P.

The time yield/studies also provided further evidence the unidentified polar radiometabolites associated with RP peak 1* are metabolic end products.  For the P and DHP incubates, the collective formation of the aforementioned polar radiometabolites initially lags behind the formation of THP.  As the formation of the latter begins to plateau with increasing time between four to 24 hours,  the net yield of radiometabolites associated with RP peak 1* continues to rise.  The time/yield studies also indicate 5&#225;-reduction and perhaps 3&#225;-hydroxylation are pre-requisite steps in the formation of the polar metabolites.  Cultures incubated with the 5&#225;-reduced progestins from one to four hours form higher yields of the radiometabolites associated with RP peak 1* compared to cultures incubated with P as substrate.  The net yields of the radiometabolites associated with RP peak 1* for cultures incubated with THP were substantially higher compared to cultures incubated with DHP after equivalent times.

The effect selected neuroligands have on the yield of radiometabolites formed by cultured astrocytes incubated with 50nM (3)H-P was also examined.  Dibutyryl cyclic adenosine monophosphate (DBcAMP), not actually a neuroligand per se, but an analog of the intracellular secondary messenger cAMP, was also utilised in these studies.  The inhibitory neurotransmitter &#227;-amino-nbutyric acid (GABA), DBcAMP and isoproterenol (a &#226;-adrenergic receptor agonist) all quickly induce a transient but substantial increase in 20&#225;-HSOR activity in cultured astrocytes.  Cultures pretreated with these three compounds (10, 20 and 1&#181;M respectively) form substantially higher yields of 20&#225;-hydroxylated metabolites, including 20&#225;OH-THP (between 200 to 580% greater), when incubated with 50nM (3)H-P for one to four hours.  These increases also coincide with increases in the net yield of metabolites formed (by 16 to 48%).  The same pre-treated cultures form significantly lower yields of THP, by 25 to 41%, after one hour.  This is most likely due to the increased metabolism of any formed THP into 20&#225;OH-THP.

Octopamine (an &#225;-adrenergic agonist) only induces a slight increase in 20&#225;-HSOR activity, having relatively little effect on the yield of 20&#225;OH-THP formed.  Pretreatment with octopamine induces a significant increase in the yield of THP for cultures incubated with (3)H-P for four hours (by 24%).  The increase in THP formation appears to be due to an increase in 3&#225;-HSOR activity, as judged by the concomitant drop in the yield of the 5&#225;-reduced, 3-keto substrates.  An increase in 5&#225;-reductase activity cannot be excluded however.  Isoproterenol appears to induce an increase in 5&#225;-reductase activity as isoproterenol appears to induce an increase in 5&#225;-reductase activity as isoproterenol one and four hour incubates have higher yields of DHP.  This is in contrast to the other three incubates.  After 12 hours, all incubates have higher yields of THP (15-30%).</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">progesterone</field><field name="subject">neurochemistry</field><field name="subject">glial cells</field><field name="subject">steroidogenesis</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20061207.154152</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The mechanical behaviour of irregular fibre materials</field><field name="creator">He, Wendy Weiyu</field><field name="description">This work investigates the effect of fibre irregularities on the mechanical behaviour of the irregular fibres using the finite element method (FEM).

The first part of this work examines that the effect of fibre dimensional irregularities on the linear and non-linear tensile behaviour of the fibres, using a two-dimensional (2D) finite element models.  In the linear simulation, a concept of method Young&#146;s modulus is introduced.  The method Young&#146;s modulus, breaking load and breaking extension are affected by the magnitude and frequency of diameter variation in the fibre specimen.  Fibre dimensional variation and the gauge length effect are also simulated.  In the non-linear analysis, some additional information is obtained on changes in the yield and post-yield regions, which are clearly shown in the load-extension curves.

Further investigation is focused on the flexural buckling behaviour of fibres with dimensional irregularities.  A three-dimensional (3D) finite element model is used to simulate the buckling deformation of dimensionally irregular fibres, and the critical buckling load of the simulated fibre is calculated.  Two parameters, the effective length and the average diameter within the effective length of an irregular fibre, are considered to be the key factors that influence the buckling behaviour of the fibre.  An important aspect of this work is the calculation of the effective length of an irregular fibre specimen during buckling.  This method has not been reported before.

The third part of this work is on the combined tensile and torsional behaviour of fibres with dimensional irregularities, using a three-dimensional (3D) finite element model.  Two types of fibres, polyester and wool, are simulated with sine waves of different level (magnitude) and frequency at different twist levels.  For the polyester fibre, experiment verification of the simulation results has been carried out, and the results indicate the FE model is well acceptable for the simulation.

The final part of this work examines the combined effect of dimensional and structural irregularities on the fibre tensile behaviour.  Three-dimensional (3D) finite element models are used to simulate the cracks (transverse, longitudinal, combined transverse and longitudinal cracks) and cavities distributed in uniform fibres and fibres with 30% level of diameter variation, respectively.  One of important conclusions is that under the simulated conditions, the dimensional irregularity of fibre influences the tensile behaviour of fibres more than the fibre structural irregularity.  The fibre dimensional irregularity affects not only the values of the breaking load and breaking extension, but also the shape of load-extension curves.  However, the fibre structural irregularity simulated in the study appears to have little effect on the shape of the load-extension curves.  In addition, the effect of crack or cavity size, type and distribution on fibre tensile properties is also investigated.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">textiles</field><field name="subject">textile fibres</field><field name="subject">testing fibres</field><field name="subject">irregular fibres</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20061208.081806</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Leading lights: The promotion of garden suburb plans and planners in interwar Australia</field><field name="creator">Nichols, David</field><field name="description">This thesis explores interwar town planning in Australia, focusing on the period of large-scale urban expansion in the 1920&#146;s.  It problematises aspects of Australia&#146;s urban planning history, particularly the 1920s &#145;garden suburb.  It also investigates the question of the use of international planning ideas in Australia, and the assertion or creation of authority by the Australian planning movement.  The thesis additionally investigates the use of authoritative planning rhetoric for commercial or creative advantage.

The thesis argues that the majority of innovative planning projects in the interwar years took place in the formation and foundation of the garden suburb.  It shows that the garden suburb &#150; assumed in much planning history to be an inferior form of Ebenezer Howard&#146;s &#145;garden city&#146; ideal &#150; has, in fact, a number of precedents in 19th century Australian suburbia, some of which were retained in 20th century commercial estate design.  Much of the Australian town planner&#146;s authority at this time required recognition and awareness of the interests and needs of the general public, as negotiated through land vendors.  As Australians looked to the future, and to the US for guidance, they were invited to invest in speculative real estate development modelled on this vision.

The thesis concentrates primarily on the lives, careers and work of the British-Australian architect-planner Sir John Sulman; the Chicagoan architect-planners Marion Mahony and Walter Burley Griffin; and the Australian surveyor-planner Saxil Tuxen.  These individuals were among the most prominent planners in Australia in the interwar years.  All designed Australian garden suburbs, and combined advocacy with practice in private and public spheres.

The thesis examines images and personas, both generic and individual, of the planner and the vendor.  It shows that the formulation of the garden suburb and design practices, and the incorporation of international elements into Australian planning, are important in the creation of planning practice and forms.  It also outlines the way these continue to have significant impact, in diverse and important ways, on both the contemporary built environment and planning history itself.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">city planning</field><field name="subject">John Sulman</field><field name="subject">Marion Mahony Griffin</field><field name="subject">Walter Burley Griffin</field><field name="subject">Saxil Tuxan</field><field name="subject">garden suburb plans</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20061208.082527</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Women's cognitive and emotional processing during sexual arousal: The effects of erotic film and absorption</field><field name="creator">Sheen, Jade</field><field name="description">Sexual arousal is a complex and dynamic element of women&#146;s sexuality.  Accounts
vary, however most multidimensional models highlight the cognitive, affective and
physiological components of the female sexual arousal response.  While literature examining the peripheral physiological changes that occur during female sexual
arousal abounds, there has been a dearth of literature pertaining to the cognitive and
affective components.  Thus, while many authors have included cognitive and 
emotions as independent components of the female sexual arousal response, there
has been little empirical research to validate this approach.  The aim of the current
thesis was to examine the cognitive and affective components of female sexual
arousal in more depth, investigating the nature of the relationship between these components under various experimental conditions.  In order to do so, two integrated studies were conducted, each highlighting the effects of either external or internal variables on women&#146;s subjective sexual arousal, absorption, positive affect and negative affect.

Study One was designed to evaluate women&#146;s emotional and cognitive processing of two elements of erotic film &#150; foreplay and erotic context. 60 women were asked to report their subjective sexual arousal, absorption, positive affect and negative affect in response to one of four erotic film excerpts.  The erotic excerpts varied in accordance with the degree of foreplay (low vs. high) depicted and the context in which the sexual activities took place (novel vs. habitual context).  Women in the study responded more favourably to the high foreplay erotic film excerpt, subsequently reporting higher degrees of subjective sexual arousal, absorption and positive affect.  Women also responded favourably to the erotic excerpt filmed in a novel context, reporting greater subjective sexual arousal as a result.  The environment in which the sexual encounters were filmed failed to have an effect however, on women&#146;s absorption or their positive or negative affect.  The results of Study One suggest that stimulus specific variables, such as the degree of foreplay depicted, have a significant influence on female cognitive and emotional processing of erotic film.  The results also suggest that a relationship exists between absorption, subjective sexual arousal and positive affect, albeit a correlational one.  Specifically, there was evidence of parallel processing during sexual arousal, as participant reported sexual arousal, absorption and positive affect all increased and decreased in unison.  Based on the results it was suggested that future research attempt to experimentally manipulate one of these variables, to examine its direct effect on the remaining variable.

Thus, Study Two aimed to examine the effects of absorption on women&#146;s cognitive and emotional processing of erotica.  Study Two manipulated absorption at two levels (high vs. low), examining the impact of these states on participants&#146; subsequent absorption, subjective sexual arousal and positive and negative affect. 62 women were asked to read one of two sets of test session instructions.  The first, participant-oriented instruction set, instructed participants to immerse themselves in the erotic film excerpt, as if they were active participants in the sexual exchange.  The second, spectator-oriented instruction set, directed participants to observe and evaluate the erotic film.  These instructions were designed to elicit high and low degrees of absorption, respectively.  The utility of this approach when manipulating female absorption, was demonstrated by self reported ratings of absorption, given at the conclusion of the film presentation.  Participants were also asked to report their subjective sexual arousal and positive and negative affect at the conclusion of the erotic film presentation.  The findings of this study suggest that the adoption of a participant-oriented (high absorption) perspective elicits more favourable responses from participants than a spectator-oriented (low absorption) perspective, with participants in the former experimental group reporting greater degrees of subjective sexual arousal and positive affect.  Negative affect was equivalent across experimental conditions, with the participants reporting that they experienced little to no aversive feelings during either of the experimental conditions.  The results suggest that the degree to which a women immerses and absorbs herself in a sexual stimulus has a significant impact in her subsequent cognitive and affective processing of that stimulus.  More specifically, it appears that women respond more favourably when they are highly absorbed and immersed in a stimulus, reporting greater subjective sexual arousal and positive affect.

Overall, the results of Studies One and Two highlight the dynamic and complex nature of female sexual arousal.  It appears that women have definite cognitive and affective responses to sexual stimuli.  The magnitude of these responses may be mediated by a number of factors however, including the intrinsic qualities of the stimulus and the degree to which the woman attends to the stimulus.  Both these variables act to either enhance or inhibit the sexual arousal response.  There results have important implications for current sexuality literature.  While women&#146;s cognitions and emotions in response to erotic film were generally highly correlated, in some instances they differed, warranting their inclusion as separate elements in models of female sexual arousal.  Furthermore, it might be suggested that the inclusion of an additional variable &#150; absorption &#150; into current models of female sexual arousal would prove beneficial, aiding researchers to better understand and predict the arousal process.  As such, recommendations are made for a revised model of female sexual arousal.  In terms of future directions, the results of the present thesis have implications for the treatment of sexual dysfunctions, suggesting that clinicians need to understand the internal and external variables that might contribute to the aetiology and maintenance of their presenting problems.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">sex psychology</field><field name="subject">arousal</field><field name="subject">sexual behaviour</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20061208.084141</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Examination of the relationship between maternal depression and ADHD</field><field name="creator">Sheen, Jade</field><field name="description">[No Abstract]</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ADHD</field><field name="subject">maternal depression</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20061208.084649</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Situationist outdoor education in the country of lost children</field><field name="creator">Brookes, Andrew Roy</field><field name="description">This thesis is a study of outdoor education, in the deliberative tradition of curriculum inquiry. It examines the intentional generation and distribution of knowledge, beliefs, and attitudes through organised outdoor activities, both as a research interest, and as a critical perspective on outdoor education discourse.
Eight separate but interrelated research projects, originally published in 11 refereed journal articles, develop and defend the thesis statement: 
The problem of determining what, if any, forms of outdoor experience should be educational priorities, and how those experiences should be distributed in communities and geographically &#150; that is who goes where and does what &#150; is inherently situational. The persistence of a universalist outdoor education discourse that fails to acknowledge or adequately account for social and geographic circumstances points to serious flaws in outdoor education research and theory, and impedes the development of more defensible outdoor education practices. 
The introduction explains how the eight projects cohere, and illustrates how they may be linked using the example of militaristic thinking in outdoor safety standards.  Chapters 1 and 2 defend and elaborate a situationist approach to outdoor education, using the examples of outdoor education in Victoria (Australia), and universalist approaches to outdoor education in textbooks respectively. 
Chapters 3 and 4 expand on some epistemological implications of the thesis and examine, respectively, the cultural dimensions of outdoor experience, and the epistemology and ontology of local natural history. Chapters 5 and 6 apply a situationist epistemology to personal development based outdoor education. Traditions of outdoor education that draw on person-centred rather than situation-sensitive theories of behaviour are examined and critiqued. Alternatives to person-centred theories of outdoor education are discussed. Chapters 7 and 8 use situationist outdoor education to provide a critical reading of nature-based tourism. Chapters 9, 10, and 11 return to the theme of safety in the introduction and Chapter 1, and examine the safety implications of a situationist epistemology.
Closing comments briefly draw together the conclusions of all of the chapters, and offer some directions for future outdoor education research.</field><field name="date">22/8/2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">outdoor education</field><field name="subject">environmental education</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">experiential education</field><field name="subject">safety</field><field name="subject">critique</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20061214.144321</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Social control, self-control and psychosocial problems in adolescent males</field><field name="creator">Bell, Ian Douglas</field><field name="description">&#145;Psychosocial problems&#146; are psychological problems that are regarded as resulting from the interaction between the adaptive capacities of individuals and the demands of their physical and social environments.  Many different factors have been theoretically proposed, and empirically established, as predictors of a range of psychosocial problems in adolescents.  However, a problem exists in that this literature appears to lack an integrative framework that has validity across the range of problems that are observed.

The purpose of the current research is to propose and test a model that draws together three clusters of factors that are useful in predicting the incidence of adolescent psychosocial problems.  These are family structural background factors, family functioning variables and control beliefs.  Data were collected from 155 adolescent males aged between 12 and 19 by a single concurrent and retrospective self-report questionnaire.  This included data about the respondent (age, involvements with mental health or juvenile justice agencies) and family structural background factors (days per week worked by mother/father, occupational status for mother/father, residential mobility, number of persons in the family home).  The questionnaire also incorporated the Parental Bonding Instrument (Parker, Tupling &amp; Brown, 1979) to quantify the levels of perceived parental care and overprotection, and an adaptation of the Parental Discipline Style Scale (Shaw &amp; Scott, 1991), to assess punitive, love withdrawing and inductive discipline practices.  In addition, the (Low) Self-control Scale (Grasmick, Tittle, Bursick &amp; Arneklev, 1993) and the Locus of Control of Behaviour Scale (Craig, Franklin, &amp; Andrews, 1984) were used to collect data concerning adolescents&#146; perceived behavioural self-control and locus of control.  Finally, selected sub-scales of the Child Behavior Checklist Youth Self-Report (Achenbach, 1991b) were used to collect data on the incidence of social withdrawal, somatisation, anxiety and depression, aggression and delinquency among the respondents, and in aggregated form, the incidence of &#145;total problems&#146; and internalising and externalising behaviours.

Results indicated family structural background factors, family functioning variables and control beliefs possess limited predicted validity and that the usefulness of the proposed model varies between specific psychosocial problems.  Family functioning variables were generally stronger predictors than family structural background factors, particularly for internalising behaviours.  Of these, levels of parental care and overprotection were generally the strongest predictors.  Perceived self-control and locus of control were also generally strong predictors, but were particularly powerful with respect to externalising behaviours.  The strength of predictive relationships was observed to vary between specific internalising and externalising behaviours, suggesting that individual difference variables not assessed in the current research were differentially influential.  Finally, the parental and individual characteristics that predicted maximal levels of adjustment (defined in terms of minimal levels of internalising and externalising behaviours) were explored and the correlates of various parenting style typologies (Parker et al., 1979) were investigated.  These results strongly confirmed the importance of family functioning and control beliefs with respect to the prediction of internalising, externalising and well-adjusted behaviours.  In all analyses, substantial proportions of the variance in the incidence of problem behaviours remain unexplained.

The findings are examined in relation to previous research focused on (familial) social control and (individual) self-control with respect to psychosocial problems in adolescents.  In addition, methodological considerations are discussed and the implications of the findings for clinical and community interventions to address problem behaviours, and for further study, are explored.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">mental health</field><field name="subject">adolescent psychology</field><field name="subject">family mental health</field><field name="subject">adolescent males</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20070119.100141</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Improving clinical judgements</field><field name="creator">Bell, Ian Douglas</field><field name="description">This portfolio explored issues that are relevant to the judgements routinely made by clinical psychologists.  The first chapter provides a theoretical overview of relevant issues.  In this chapter, firstly, the debate over the relative merits of &#145;clinical&#146; and &#145;statistical&#146; approaches to clinical judgement (Meehl, 1954) is reviewed.  It is noted that, although much of the empirical evidence supports the greater accuracy of statistical approaches to making judgements (where appropriate methods exist), they are rarely routinely used, and clinical approaches to making judgements continue to dominate in the majority of clinical settings.  Secondly, common sources of errors in clinical judgement are reviewed.  These include the misuse of cognitive heuristics, the presence of clinicians&#146; biases, the limitations to human information-processing capacities and the over-reliance on clinical interviews.  Finally, some of the basic strategies that can be useful to clinicians in improving the accuracy of clinical judgement are described.  These include undertaking advanced level training programs, using quality instruments and procedures, being wary of over-reliance on theories, adhering to the scientist-practitioner approach and being selective in the distribution of professional efforts and time.  In the subsequent chapters these strategies are explored further through four clinical case studies.  These cases were collected during the university placement program and they have been selected to illustrate some of the approaches as clinician may use in attempting to optimise the accuracy of judgements necessary in the context of clinical psychological practice.  The final chapter provides a brief overview and discussion of these cases in relation to the issues identified in Chapter One,</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">mental health</field><field name="subject">family mental health</field><field name="subject">adolescent psychology</field><field name="subject">clinical judgements</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20070119.100737</field></doc><doc><field name="title">At the limits: Postcolonial &amp; Hyperreal Translations of Australian Poetry</field><field name="creator">McCarthy, Bridie Clare</field><field name="description">This dissertation employs the methodologies of postcolonial theory and hyperreal theory (following Baudrillard), in order to investigate articulations of identity, nation and representation in contemporary Australian poetry.  Informed by a comparative analysis of contemporary Latin American poetry and cultural theory (in translation), as a means of re-examining the Australian context, this dissertation develops a new transnational model of Australian poetics.

The central thesis of this dissertation is that contemporary Australian poetry engages with the postcolonial at its limits.  That is, at those sites of postcoloniality that are already mapped by theory, but also at those that occur beyond postcolonial theory.  The hyperreal is understood as one such limit, traceable within the poetry but silenced in conventional postcolonial theory.  As another limit to the postcolonial, this dissertation reads Latin American poetry and theory, in whose texts postcolonial theory is actively resisted, but where postcolonial and hyperreal poetics nevertheless intersect.

The original critical context constructed by this dissertation enables a new set of readings of Australian identity through its poetry.  Within this new interpretative context, the readings of contemporary Australian poetry articulate a psycho-social postcoloniality; offer a template for future transactions between national poetry and global politics; and develop a model of the postcolonial hyperreal.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australian poetry</field><field name="subject">history and criticism</field><field name="subject">postcolonialism in literature</field><field name="subject">reality in literature</field><field name="subject">national charcateristics</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20070329.093702</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modeling data processing activity to assess the internal control function</field><field name="creator">Pinnis, John</field><field name="description">This thesis describes research that was conducted into the potential of modeling the activities of the Data Processing Department as an aid to the computer auditor.

A methodology is composed to aid in the evaluation of the Internal Controls, particularly the General Controls relative to computer processing.  Consisting of three major components, the methodology enables the auditor to model the presumed activities of the Data Processing Department against the actual activities, as recorded on the Operating System Log.

The first component of the methodology is the construction and loading of a model of the presumed activities of the Data Processing Department from its verbal, scheduled, and reported activities.

The second component is the generation of a description of the actual activities of the Data Processing Department from the information recorded on the Operating System Log.  This is effected by reducing the Operating System Log to the format described by the Standard Audit File concept.

Finally, the third component in the methodology is the modeling process itself.  This is in fact a new analysis technique proposed for use by the EDP auditor.  The modeling process is composed of software that compares the model developed and loaded in the first component, with the description of actual activity as collated by the second component.  Results from this comparison are then reviewed by the auditor, who determines if they adequately depict the situation, or whether the models description as specified in the first component requires to be altered, and the modeling process re-initiated.

In conducting the research, information and data from a production installation was used.  Use of the &#145;real-world&#146; input proved both the feasibility of developing a model of the reported activities of the Data Processing Department, and the adequacy of the operating system log as a source of information to report the departments actual activities.  Additionally, it enabled the involvement and comment of practicing auditors.

The research involved analysis of the effect of EDP on the audit process, structure of the EDP audit process, data reduction, data structures, model formalization, and model processing software.  Additionally, the Standard Audit File concept was verified through its use by practising auditors, and expanded by the development of an indexed data structure, which enabled its analysis to be conducted interactively.

Results from the trial implementation of the research software and methodology at a production installation confirmed the research hypothesis that the activities of the Data Processing Department could be modelled, and that there are substantial benefits from the EDP auditor in analysing this process.

The research in fact provides a new source of information, and develops a new analysis technique for the EDP auditor.  It demonstrates the utilization of computer technology to monitor itself for the audit function, and reasserts auditor independence by providing access to technical detail describing the processing activities of the computer.</field><field name="date">1983</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">electronic data processing</field><field name="subject">auditing</field><field name="subject">internal control</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20070329.133954</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Cliched gaze of the migrant on the Australian screen</field><field name="creator">Siracusa, Ettore</field><field name="description">The thesis takes up the question of the representation of the migrant on the Australian screen in terms of a specific set of concerns around the notions of stereotype and self-reflexivity.  The stereotype is read as a self-referential image: hence, as a question of film spectatorship and identity; in short as an unconscious reflex or self image.

The text of the thesis is in two parts: part one, comprises the production of the film &#145;Italians at home&#146;.  It is the major component of research and text which, for this purpose, has been copied and submitted hereto on VHS video cassette.  Part two, includes an analysis and discussion of the television documentary &#145;The migrant experience&#146;, and an exegesis, of the production, narrative and reception of the film &#145;Italians at home&#146;.

The migrant experience is read and discussed as an exemplary text of dominant, stereotyped discourse of cultural difference; while &#145;Italians at home&#146; is proposed as a parallel text and a self-reflexive reading and criticism of such a text.

Both the television documentary and the film, deal with the representation and problematic of homogenised representations of ethnicity.  In the case of &#145;The migrant experience&#146;, it is argued, that the figure of the migrant as other and self-image, functions as an object of Australian culture and discourse of national identity within a logic of representation of binary structures; while the film &#145;Italians at home&#146;, the question of self-referentiality is seen in terms of the viewing subject and a problematic of film representation; thus, the film attempts to make such signifying structures, visual codes and agreed assumptions of otherness visible, while, at the same time, attempting to displace them or pose them as a problem of representation or reading for the viewer.</field><field name="date">1993</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">migration</field><field name="subject">Australian screen</field><field name="subject">Australian film</field><field name="subject">migration experience</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20070329.140940</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of the Geelong Local Learning and Employment Network</field><field name="creator">Kamp, Annelies</field><field name="description">In common with many Western nations, Australian governments, both state and federal, have increasingly embraced network-based approaches in responding to the effects of globalisation. Since 2001, thirty one Local Learning and Employment Networks (LLEN) have been established across all areas of Victoria, Australia in line with recommendations of a Ministerial Review into Post Compulsory Education and Training Pathways. That review reported that, in the globalised context, youth in transition from schooling to independence faced persistent and severe difficulties unknown to previous generations; it also found problems were frequently concentrated in particular groups and regions. LLEN bring together the expertise and experience of local education providers, industry, community organisations, individuals and government organisations. As a result of their local decisions, collaboration and community building efforts it is intended that opportunities for young people will be enhanced. 
My research was conducted within an Australian Research Council Linkage Project awarded to Deakin University Faculty of Education in partnership with the Smart Geelong Region LLEN (SGR LLEN). The Linkage Project included two separate research components one of which forms my thesis: a case study of SGR LLEN. My data was generated through participant observation in SGR LLEN throughout 2004 and 2005 and through interviews, reflective writing and archival review. In undertaking my analysis and presenting my thesis I have chosen to weave a series of panels whose orientation is poststructural. This approach was based in my acceptance that all knowledge is partial and fragmentary and, accordingly, researchers need to find ways that highlight the intersections in and indeterminacy of their empirical data. The LLEN is -by its nature as a network -more than the contractual entity that gains funding from government, acts as the administrative core and occupies the LLEN office. As such I have woven firstly the formation and operational structure of the bounded entity that is SGR LLEN before weaving a series of six images that portray the unbounded LLEN as an instance-in-action. The thesis draws its theoretical inspiration from the work of Deleuze and Guattari (1987). 
Despite increased use of notions of networks, local decision-making and community building by governments there had been little empirical research that explored stakeholder understandings of networks and their role in community building as well as a lack of theorisation of how networks actually &#145;work.&#146; My research addresses this lack and suggests an instituted network can function as a learning community capable of fostering systemic change in the post compulsory education training and employment sector and thereby contributing to better opportunities for young people. However the full potential of the policy is undermined by the reluctance of governments to follow through on the implications of their policies and, in particular, to confront the limiting effects of performativity at all levels.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Geelong</field><field name="subject">Local Learning and Employment Networks</field><field name="subject">Education and training services industry</field><field name="subject">Vocational education</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20070329.145032</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Foucauldian analysis and the best interests of the child</field><field name="creator">Rogerson, Thomas Stephen</field><field name="description">In this thesis I have developed a theoretical framework using Michel Foucault&#146;s metaphor of the panopticon and applied the resulting discursive methodology to prominent risk assessment texts in Tasmanian Government child protection services.  From the analysis I have developed an innovation poststructural practice of discursive empathy for use in child protection social work.

Previous research has examined discourses such as madness, mothering, the family and masculinity using Foucault&#146;s ideas and argued that each is a performance of social government.  However my interest is in &#145;the best interests of the child&#146; as governmentality; risk as the apparatus through which it is conducted and child abuse its social effect.  In applying a discursive analysis, practices of risk assessment are therefore understood to actually produce intellectual and material conditions favourable to child abuse, rather than protect children from maltreatment.

The theoretical framework produces in this thesis incorporates three distinct components of Foucault&#146;s interpretive analytics of power: archaeology, genealogy and ethics.  These components provide a structure for discourse analysis that is also a coherent methodical practice of Foucault&#146;s notion of &#145;parrhesia&#146;.  The practice of parrhesia involves social workers recognised that social power is subjectively dispersed yet also hierarchical.  Using this notion I have analysed &#145;the best interest of the child&#146; as a panopticon and argued that child abuse is a consequence.

This thesis therefore demonstrates how child protection social workers can expose the political purpose involved in the discourse &#145;the best interests of the child&#146;, and in doing so challenge the hostile intellectual and material conditions that exist for children in our community.  In concluding, I identify how discursive empathy is a readily accessible skill that social workers can use to practice parrhesia in a creative way.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">child abuse</field><field name="subject">child welfare</field><field name="subject">abused children</field><field name="subject">Social work with children</field><field name="subject">indigenous children</field><field name="subject">social service</field><field name="subject">Michel Foucault</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20070330.135647</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fathoming the fathers in environmental education : a feminist poststructuralist analysis</field><field name="creator">Gough, Annette</field><field name="description">The purpose of this study is to provide a feminist poststructuralist analysis of the dominant international discourses in environmental education, and how these have been realised in Australian national statements and in state policies over the past two decades, in terms of their implicit views about science, the environment, epistemology and education.
The methodology of the study presents an argument for a 'politics of method' in the form of a research approach which reflects the ideology and intent of the study, i.e. an argument toward feminist poststructuralism as a methodology, but with elements of critical feminist research. Part of this methodology involves consideration of the gendered nature of language and discourses, particularly in the sciences. The argument is for the reconstituting of knowledge through feminist standpoint theory and the adoption of standards of 'strong objectivity'.
In the spirit of its poststructuralist methodology the study presents three different stories (archaeologies) about environmental education: one told in terms of people, events and their outcomes; one told in terms of the changing views of education and how these were interpreted in environmental education; and the third told in terms of the emergence of ecofeminism as a parallel movement to environmental education and the emerging relationship between these two movements. These stories serve two purposes: to review the relevant literature in these three areas, and to provide the 'data' for later chapters.
The discourses of environmental education, particularly those of the 'founders' and UNESCO documents, are then analysed from a poststructuralist perspective, followed by a feminist reconstruction of environmental education which argues for thinking from women's and other marginalized lives as a preferred strategy for environmental education, and develops research principles to explore this possibility. The conclusion reflects on the philosophical and theoretical issues engaged, and the methodological issues addressed, in the study.</field><field name="date">1994</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">conservation</field><field name="subject">natural resources</field><field name="subject">Annette Greenall Gough</field><field name="subject">ecology</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20070330.151753</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Multiple strategy process migration.</field><field name="creator">De Paoli, Damien</field><field name="description">The future of computing lies with distributed systems, i.e. a network of workstations controlled by a modern distributed operating system. By supporting load balancing and parallel execution, the overall performance of a distributed system can be improved dramatically. Process migration, the act of moving a running process from a highly loaded machine to a lightly loaded machine, could be used to support load balancing, parallel execution, reliability etc.
This thesis identifies the problems past process migration facilities have had and determines the possible differing strategies that can be used to resolve these problems. The result of this analysis has led to a new design philosophy. This philosophy requires the design of a process migration facility and the design of an operating system to be conducted in parallel.
Modern distributed operating systems follow the microkernel and client/server paradigms. Applying these design paradigms, in conjunction with the requirements of both process migration and a distributed operating system, results in a system where each resource is controlled by a separate server process. However, a process is a complex resource composed of simple resources such as data structures, an address space and communication state. For this reason, a process migration facility does not directly migrate the resources of a process. Instead, it requests the appropriate servers to transfer the resources. This novel solution yields a modular, high performance facility that is easy to create, debug and maintain. Furthermore, the design easily incorporates providing multiple migration strategies.
In order to verify the validity of this design, a process migration facility was developed and tested within RHODOS (ResearcH Oriented Distributed Operating System). RHODOS is a modern microkernel and client/server based distributed operating system. In RHODOS, a process is composed of at least three separate resources: process state - maintained by a process manager, address space - maintained by a memory manager and communication state - maintained by an InterProcess Communication Manager (IPCM). The RHODOS multiple strategy migration manager utilises the services of the process, memory and IPC Managers to migrate the resources of a process. Performance testing of this facility indicates that this design is as fast or better than existing systems which use faster hardware. Furthermore, by studying the results of the performance test 
ing, the conditions under which a particular strategy should be employed have been identified.
This thesis also addresses heterogeneous process migration. The current trend is to have islands of homogeneous workstations amid a sea of heterogeneity. From this situation and the current literature on the topic, heterogeneous process migration can be seen as too inefficient for general use. Instead, only homogeneous workstations should be used for process migration. This implies a need to locate homogeneous workstations. Entities called traders, which store and disseminate knowledge about the resources of several workstations, should be used to provide resource discovery. Resource discovery will enable the detection of homogeneous workstations to which processes can be migrated.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">operating systems</field><field name="subject">computers</field><field name="subject">design</field><field name="subject">distributed operating systems</field><field name="subject">electronic data processing</field><field name="subject">distributed processing</field><field name="subject">RHODOS</field><field name="subject">research oriented distributed operating system</field><field name="subject">IPCM</field><field name="subject">InterProcess communication manager</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20051110.115628</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies on Australian hydroids the genus eudendrium and the fauna of the seagrass amphibolis</field><field name="creator">Watson, Jeanette Esther</field><field name="description">An important Athecate genus, Eudendrium, and a group of species of the Thecata, the latter ecologically related by life on a common substrate, are reviewed.
Eudendrium, hitherto poorly known in Australia, comprises 17 species, including 10 undescribed species with 71% Australian, and high provincial endemicity. Eudendrium may be a shelf genus avoiding turbulent oceanic waters. Species of Eudendrium are predominantly epizoic and some gregariously settling colonies may live for five years. Identification of sterile material is refined by using the cnidome in a key to classification.
The species and population dynamics of hydroid epiphytes of the endemic southern Australian marine angiosperm Amphibolis were investigated with revision of historically vexatious taxa. In contrast with the northern hemisphere, no Athecata are associated with southern Australian seagrasses. Seventeen species from eight thecate families are associated with the two species of Amphibolis, including one undescribed species, H&amp;lecium amphibolum, and one new record for Australia, Aglaophenia postdentata. The Lineolariidae is revised and a new genus, Millardaria, erected for a species from seagrass in Madagascar. The high endemicity (58%) and host-specificity of hydroids to Amphibolis is an evolutionary consequence of isolation of the seagrass dating from break-up of the Tethyan Sea.
Hydroids occur throughout the year in the Amphibolis leaf canopy with a mean annual epiphytism of 44% on A. antarctica in the eastern continent and 86% in the western continent; epiphytism is 52% on A. griffithii in the western continent. Half of the eight important species are dominant epiphytes across the southern continent but the species and order of abundance varies regionally. Most are pioneer colonists with short, repetetive life-cycles lasting from weeks to a few months.
Three species epiphytise the seagrass stems but only one is a leaf-canopy dominant. The canopy community comprises small, fast-growing species or dwarfed variants of species larger in other habitats: these ecomorphically constant forms are associated only with seagrass. Strategies for survival in the harsh Amphibolis environment include adnate colonies and gonothecae adnate or recumbent to the substrate, marked strengthening of the hydrorhiza, various hydrodynamic adaptations of the hydrotheca, early maturation and production of numerous small ova.</field><field name="date">1990</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">hydroida</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">eudendrium</field><field name="subject">amphibolis</field><field name="subject">seagrass</field><field name="subject">athecate genus</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20050825.121035</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The ecology of Pittosporum undulatum Vent. (Puttosporaceae) an environmental weed in south east Australia.</field><field name="creator">Mullett, Trudi</field><field name="description">Pittosporum  undulatum Vent. (Sweet Pittosporum) is a densely foliaged tall shrub or small tree, native to the wet forests of south east Australia, This species now functions as a serious environmental weed in a range of habitats in Australia and on other continents and islands throughout the temperate, sub-tropical and tropical zones. This study investigated some of the ecological causes and consequences of  P. undulatum invasion across a range of habitat types in south east Australia.
Key aspects of P. undulatum biology and ecology investigated in the current study include; patterns of morphological variation across the range of habitats occupied (as a measure of the species&#146; plasticity), dispersal ecology and seed germinability, population structure and spatial pattern, community relationships and the ecological impacts of invasion.
Phenotypic plasticity is considerable in P. undulatum. No clear patterns of geographic variation emerged from a study of leaf morphological attributes across the current range of this species on mainland south east Australia. The pattern of morphological variation is particularly complex in Victoria, where the invasion of this species is most advanced. The species&#146; adaptability to a range of environments and environmental conditions will likely promote further range expansion.
The abundant winter fruit crop produced by functionally female P. undulatum plants attracts a suite of generalist opportunistic frugivores, which feed on P. undulatum fruits and seeds at various stages of fruit dehiscence, thereby enhancing dispersal opportunities for this species. P. undulatum seed collected from natural and invasive populations, at two stages of fruit maturity and from the scats and pellets of dispersal agents, displayed high germinability. European Blackbirds and Pied Currawongs are implicated as the main avian dispersal agents of P undulatum in south east Australia. The broader ecological implications of developing relationships between invasive fleshy-fruited bird-dispersed plant species and adaptive frugivores are likely to be considerable.
The distribution of P. undulatutn seedlings was significantly negatively correlated with adult conspecifics and significantly positively correlated with trees and shrubs of other genera. This pattern reflects the importance of both firugivorous dispersal agents and the species&#146; germination and establishment requirements, in shaping the contagious distribution pattern typical of this species. These analyses suggest that recruitment opportunities for conspecific seedlings are limited beneath the canopy of adult conspecifics. Densities of P. undulatum were on average, 2.7 times higher in invaded populations, compared to the natural populations sampled.  A male-bias was evident in all populations and no relationships between reproductive activity and the density of seedlings and juveniles were evident.
Invading populations of P. undulatum impose substantial changes on ecosystem-level properties and functions. Mean species richness and cover-abundance declined notably once P. undulatum cover-abundance exceeded 20% at the invaded sites and 60% at the natural sites sampled. The natural communities sampled displayed comparatively greater resilience to the competitive effects of P. undulatum, but community attributes were affected at high densities and cover-abundance of this species. The cover-abundance of herbs and grasses declined most substantially with increasing P. undulatum at invaded sites, whereas, at the natural sites sampled, the species&#146; structural analogues appeared to be most affected by increasing P. undulatum cover-abundance.
This study has demonstrated that the ecological consequences of P. undulatum population expansion are substantial and contribute to changes in the composition and successional trajectory of affected communities. These processes ultimately lead to the loss and simplification of biodiversity values and the homogenisation of affected habitats. P. undulatum has the potential to emerge as one of south east Australia's most serious environmental weed species.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Pittosporum undulatum</field><field name="subject">weeds</field><field name="subject">research</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20050615.150347</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Narratives and Landscapes: Their Capacity to Serve Indigenous Knowledge Interests</field><field name="creator">Ford, Linda Mae</field><field name="description">The thesis is a culmination of my research which drew on tyangi wedi tjan Rak Mak Mak Marranunggu and Marrithiel knowledge systems. These awa mirr spiritual knowledge systems have guided our Pilu for millennium and have powerful spiritual affiliation to the land and our continued presences. The understandings of the spiritual connectedness and our practices of relatedness have drawn on Pulitj, our deep awa mirr spiritual philosophy that nourishes us on our country. This philosophy gave us our voice and our presence to act in our own ways of knowing and being on the landscapes created by the Western bureaucratic systems of higher education in Australia to bring forth our Tyikim knowledge systems to serve our own educational interests.

From this spiritual &#145;Puliyana kunun&#146; philosophical position the thesis examines colonising constructions of Tyikim peoples, Tyikim knowledge systems in education, Tyikim research and access to higher education for Tyikim students. From the research, it is argued that the paradigm, within which the enclave-derived approach to Indigenous higher education is located, is compatible with the normalising imperialistic ideology of higher education. The analysis of the Mirrwana/Wurrkama participatory action research project, central to the research, supported an argument for the Mirrwana/Wurrkama model of Indigenous higher education. Further analysis identified five key pedagogical principles embedded within this new model as metaphorically equivalent to wilan~bu of the pelangu. The thesis identifies the elements of the spirituality of the narrative exposed in the research-in-action through the &#147;Marri kubin mi thit wa!&#148;. This is a new paradigm for Tyikim participation in higher education within which the Mirrwana/Wurrkama model is located.

A simple and rapid enzymatic-gravimetric assay for both soluble and insoluble dietary fibre has been critically investigated. Reference samples were also analysed by a more comprehensive, enzymatic gas chromatographic method to allow testing of the relative accuracy of the enzymatic-gravimetric method. The enzymatic-gravimetric method was found to be highly reproducible but gave a slightly higher value for total dietary fibre than the more comprehensive method. This discrepancy is probably due to the presence of small quantities of resistant starch and protein residue which are recovered in the enzymatic-gravimetric method. In the enzymatic-gas chromatographic method, protein residue is not measured, and resistant starch is estimated, but not counted as dietary fibre.
The enzymatic-gravimetric method was applied to the analysis of foods commonly consumed in the Padang region of West Sumatra in Indonesia, in order to estimate dietary fibre intake in the region. Daily intakes of usual foods were estimated by use of a 24-hour recall procedure aided by food photographs to assist in the estimation of portion size. Samples of approximately 60 of the most commonly consumed foods were collected and analysed for dietary fibre. These appear to be the first data which report values for dietary fibre in Indonesion foods and they represent a significant
 
improvement upon the existing data on crude fibre content.  Knowledge of the amounts of foods usually consumed and their dietary fibre content allowed an estimation of usual intakes of dietary fibre.  Fibre intake was found to be lower than in the developing countries of Africa and was comparable to intakes measured in the U.K. This is the first study to show that in this part of South East Asia, a developing country area using polished rice as a staple food, dietary fibre intakes are as low as in Western countries.
Low intakes of fibre are believed to be related to the prevalence of a range of diseases and, in this study, preliminary data on the rates of non-infective, chronic diseases were collected from the two main hospitals in West Sumatra. Chronic, non-infectious diseases such as inguinal hernia, appendicitis, haemorrhoids, diabetes mellitus, hypertension and malignant neoplasms of the rectum are relatively frequent in West Sumatra. While no firm conclusions can be drawn from these data, they do show the possibility of a relationship between low intakes of dietary fibre and the prevalence of these diseases, and suggest that further investigation is necessary.
Some observations were made of the effect of gel-forming dietary fibre on stomach emptying and intestinal transit rate in the rat. Xanthan gum was added to iso-osmotic solutions to produce increased viscosity and phenol sulphonphthalein (phenol red) was used as a non-absorbable marker. Gavage feeding of solutions with a range of viscosities was used to study the effect of viscosity on the rate of stomach emptying and intestinal transit. Increased viscosity was observed to slow gastro-intestinal transit and this provides one mechanism by which dietary fibre of the gel-forming type ray improve glucose tolerance.</field><field name="date">1986</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">nutrition</field><field name="subject">diet</field><field name="subject">Indonesia</field><field name="subject">dietary fibre</field><field name="subject">glucose tolerance</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20050902.142103</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ontological possibilities the rethinking teaching of the 'nature of science'</field><field name="creator">Hipkins, Rosemary</field><field name="description">An extensive literature documents teachers&#146; failure to include ideas about the 'nature     of science' (NOS) in their classroom programmes, despite widespread advocacy for this as an essential component of more inclusive science teaching. This thesis frames much of the existing NOS literature as a deficit literature that focuses on epistemology, while largely ignoring the ontological realities of the classroom and overestimating individual teacher&#146;s agency to change their enacted curriculum. Epistemologically-focused NOS reforms are positioned as curriculum 'add-ons',  which teachers are likely to ignore. A NOS focus on ontology would entail curriculum restructuring, attending first to the contexts in which scientific knowledge is produced, and the ways it acts in the world.

In any case, science itself has changed in recent years. Drawing from the sociology        of science, in particular the work of Bruno Latour, the thesis compares traditional philosophical thinking about the ontology of science with more recent 'networked' views. Brent Davis explains the educational implications of key ideas from complexity science. Political philosopher Stephen White adds an ethical dimension. His ideas are used to argue for replacing 'strong' ontologies of realist science with more nuanced and actively tended 'weak' ontologies, as appropriate to the rapid sociological changes of the twenty-first century.

The thesis argues that epistemological uncertainties that could lead to the suspicion of relativism are potentially threatening in the classroom because of hegemonic pressures towards consensus and a certain, safe status for the knowledge taught. Seeking an alternative pathway to change, Daniel Liston&#146;s conceptualisation of teaching as a passionate act informs the analysis of the empirical component of the   thesis. Eight recipients of New Zealand Royal Society Science Teacher Fellowships  were interviewed on four occasions over two years. They discussed their personal learning during a year-long sabbatical to carry out an extended science investigation and their thoughts and actions on returning to the classroom. Narrative methodology is used to explore the teachers&#146; stories, revealing both passion for their personal learning and an ethical concern for their students&#146; learning to care for both the natural world and science as a means of its investigation.
 
The thesis argues for the use of ontological approaches to the initial introduction of NOS ideas in school science, with epistemological concepts added only once a topic has been grounded in what Latour calls 'matters of concern'.Two potential teaching strategies&#151;the production of network diagrams and the use of Davis's 'bifurcations'as a critical inquiry tool&#151;are the focus of hypothetical experimentation. First in the context of global warming, and then addressing the challenges posed to teaching evolution by the proponents of 'intelligent design', these strategies are shown to have the potential to address some of science education&#146; s thornier issues, not just the NOS question.

However, when conflicting expectations create tensions for teachers in the classroom moment, it is difficult for them to introduce reflective, deeply philosophical changes to their representation of science. Their working realities need to be acknowledged, and the tensions ameliorated, if we expect substantive change in their current practice.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">science</field><field name="subject">study and teaching</field><field name="subject">philosophy</field><field name="subject">curricula</field><field name="subject">nature of science</field><field name="subject">ontology</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20070801.154606</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Experimental stress analysis of a steel light truck wheel.</field><field name="creator">Cosgriff, Kevin J</field><field name="description">The development of a new automotive wheel requires extensive testing and possible design changes. The wheel investigated had three major changes during development. These three designs were subjected to a stress analysis, by experimental methods, to allow a comparison to be made between each design.
The experimental program tested the wheels under conditions designed to simulate the loading of the front wheels whilst cornering. A loading frame was built for this purpose and all testing was performed statically by multiple loading for different directions of bending moment.
Brittle lacquer coatings were used on each wheel to highlight high strain areas and indicate optimum locations for the placement of strain gauges. The strain gauges were then used to evaluate the strains. Wheel stud loads were also monitored via strain gauges applied to two of the wheel studs. All data was stored on magnetic tapes and the stress analysis performed by means of a minicomputer.
The results of the stress analysis showed quantitatively the improvement in design from the first to the third wheel design. The analysis of the stud loads and their variation during loading indicated the optimum wheel mounting face geometry to ensure nut loosening would not occur in service.</field><field name="date">1982</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">wheels</field><field name="subject">testing</field><field name="subject">automobiles</field><field name="subject">materials</field><field name="subject">fatigue</field><field name="subject">design</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20050902.144347</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Art and Oedipus</field><field name="creator">Hattam, Katherine</field><field name="description">[No Abstract]</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Art</field><field name="subject">Psychology</field><field name="subject">art psychology</field><field name="subject">Australian painting</field><field name="subject">Katherine Hattam</field><field name="subject">20th century Australian painting</field><field name="subject">oedipus</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20070816.121927</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Metaphysics of love as moral responsibility in nursing and midwifery</field><field name="creator">Fitzgerald, Leslie Robert</field><field name="description">This study used a qualitative research design incorporating principles of social constructionism, hermeneutic dialectic method, Neo-Socratic dialogue and philosophy for reporting the tacit and social knowledge constructions underlying particular ways of knowing that inform the experiential reality of love in the practice of nursing and midwifery. The philosophy of Emmanuel Levinas, that culminated in his magnum opus of the &#145;metaphysics of otherness&#146;, provided the theoretical underpinning for the interpretation of the experiences nurses and midwives believed were examples of love in their clinical practice in Australia, Singapore and Bhutan.

What is love in nursing and midwifery? The answer is moral responsibility. The relational context has a nurse and midwife constantly exposed to patient     situations that give rise to expressions of love as moral responsibility. It is a       form of love that centres on the ability of our being, or at least the possibility of   our being, to transcend its everyday form to a metaphysical state of being        moral. It enables a nurse and midwife to transcend the isolation associated with their personal being as a self-project, to be &#145;for&#146; the patient as a first priority. But while the &#145;Goodness&#146; of the &#145;Good&#146; assigns the nurse and midwife responsible    and is expressed to their personal being in the form of the &#145;urge to do&#146;, &#145;what to   do&#146; in caring for the patient is a matter of living out the command to be   responsible and will be different for each nurse and midwife.

In the periphery, natriuretic peptides reduce blood volume and subsequently blood pressure by increasing renal natriuresis and diuresis and relaxation of vascular smooth muscle. The actions of natriuretic peptides are mediated via two membrane-linked guanylate cyclase receptors (NPR-GC); natriuretic peptide receptor-A (NPR-A) which has a high affinity for ANP and BNP; and natriuretic peptide receptor-B (NPR-B)which has the greatest affinity for CNP. A third receptor not linked to guanylate cyclase, natriuretic peptide receptor-C (NPR-C) also exists, which binds to ANP, BNP and CNP with a relatively equal affinity, and is involved with clearance of the peptides from the circulation and tissues. The natriuretic peptides are present in the brain and are particularly predominant in cardiovascular and fluid and electrolyte regulating areas such as the anteroventral third ventricle (AV3V) region. This distribution has led to the suggestion natriuretic peptides play a neuromodulatory role in the central control of  fluid homeostasis. Natriuretic peptides in the brain have been observed to inhibit the release of other fluid and electrolyte regulating hormones such as arginine vasopressin (AVP) and angiotensin II (AII).
Natriuretic peptides have also been identified in the non-mammalian vertebrates although information regarding the distribution of the peptides and their receptors in the non-mammalian brain is limited. In amphibians, immunohistochemical studies have shown that natriuretic peptides are highly concentrated in the preoptic region of the brain, an area believed to be analogous to the A\T3\ region in mammals, which suggests that natriuretic peptides may also be involved in central fluid and electrolyte regulation in amphibians. To date, CNP is the only natriuretic peptide that has been isolated and cloned from the lower vertebrate brain, although studies on the distribution of CNP binding sites in the brain have only been performed in one fish species. Studies on the distribution of ANP binding sites in the lower vertebrate brain are similarly  limited and have only been performed in one fish and two amphibian species.  Moreover, the nature and distribution of the natriuretic peptide receptors has not been characterised.   The  current  study  therefore,  used  several  approaches  to  investigate  the distribution of natriuretic peptides and their receptors in the brain of the amphibian Bufo marinus. The topographical relationship of natriuretic peptides and the fluid and  electrolyte regulating hormone arginine vasotocin was also investigated, in order to gain  a greater understanding of the role of the natriuretic peptide system in the lower vertebrate brain.
Immunohistochemical studies showed natriuretic peptides were distributed throughout the brain and were highly concentrated in the preoptic region and interpeduncular nucleus. No natriuretic peptide-like immunoreactivity (NP-IR) was observed in the pituitary gland. Arginine vasotocin-like immunoreactivity (AvT-IR) was confined to distinct regions, particularly in the preoptic/hypothalamic region and pituitary gland. Double labelling studies of NP-JR and AvT-IR showed the peptides  are not colocalised in the same neural pathways.
The distribution of natriuretic peptide binding sites using the ligands 125I-rat ANP (125I-rANP) and 125I-porcine CNP (125I-pCNP) showed different distributions in the brain of B. marinus. The specificity of binding was determined by displacement with unlabelled rat ANP, porcine CNP and C-ANF, an NPR-C specific ligand. 125I-rANP binding sites were broadly distributed throughout the brain with the highest concentration in pituitary gland, habenular, medial pallium and olfactory region. Minimal 125I-rANP binding was observed in the preoptic region. Residual 125I-rANP binding in the presence of C-ANF was observed in the olfactory region, habenular and pituitary gland indicating the presence of both NPR-GC and NPR-C in these regions. 125I-pCNP binding was limited to the olfactory region, pallium and posterior pituitary gland. All 125I-pCNP binding was displaced by C-ANF which suggests that CNP in the brain of B. marinus binds only to NPR-C.
Affinity cross-linking and SDS-PAGB demonstrated two binding sites at 136 kDa and 65 kDa under reducing conditions. Guanylate cyclase assays showed 0.1 &#181;M ANP increased cGMP levels 50% above basal whilst a 10-fold higher concentration of  CNP was required to produce the same result. Molecular cloning studies revealed a 669 base pair fragment showing 91% homology with human and rat NPR-A and 89% homology with human, rat and eel NPR-B. A 432 base pair fragment showing 67% homology to the mammalian NPR-C and 58% homology with eel NPR-D was also obtained.
The results show natriuretic peptides and their receptors are distributed throughout the brain of B. marinus which   indicates that natriuretic  peptides  may participate in a range of regulatory functions throughout the brain. The potential for natriuretic peptides to regulate the release of the fluid and electrolyte regulating hormone AVT also exists due to the high number of natriuretic peptide binding sites in  the posterior pituitary gland. At least two populations of natriuretic peptide receptors are present in the brain of B. marinus, one linked to guanylate cyclase and one resembling the mammalian clearance receptor. Furthermore, autoradiography and guanylate cyclase studies suggest ANP may be the major ligand in the brain of B.  marinus, even though CNP is the only natriuretic peptide that has been isolated from the lower vertebrate brain to date.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bufo marinus</field><field name="subject">vasodilators</field><field name="subject">cardiovascular system</field><field name="subject">cardiovascular receptors</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20071024.112730</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Trace metal speciation in the Pieman River catchment, Western Tasmania.</field><field name="creator">Denney, Susan</field><field name="description">The Pieman River catchment has seen continuous mining of economic deposits of gold, silver, lead, copper, zinc and tin since the 1870&#146;s. Tributaries of this river which receive mining effluent, either directly or from acid mine drainage (AMID), have total metal concentrations considerably above background levels and are of regulatory concern.          The lower Pieman River is however classified as a State Reserve in which recreational fishing and tourism are the major activities. It is therefore important that water entering the lower Pieman River from upstream hydroelectric impoundments is of high quality.

Metals in natural waters exist in a variety of dissolved, colloidal and particulate forms. The bioavailability and hence toxicity of heavy metal pollutants is very dependant on their physico form. Knowledge of the speciation of a metal in natural aquatic environments is therefore necessary for understanding its geochemical behaviour and biological availability.

Complexation of metal ions by natural ligands in aquatic systems is believed to play a significant role in controlling their chemical speciation. This study has investigated temporal and spatial variation in complexation of metal ions in the Pieman River. The influence of pH, temperature, organic matter, salinity, ionic strength and time has been investigated in a series of field studies and in laboratory-based experiments which simulated natural and anthropogenic disturbances.

Labile metals were measured using two techniques in various freshwater and estuarine environments. Diffusive gradients in thin-films (DGT) allowed in situ measurement of solution speciation whilst differential pulse anodic stripping voltammetry (DPASV) was used to measure labile metal species in water samples collected from the catchment.

Organic complexation was found to be a significant regulating mechanism for copper speciation and the copper-binding ligand concentration usually exceeded the total         copper concentration in the river water. Complexation was highly dependent on pH and     at the river-seawater interface was also regulated by salinity, probably as a result of competitive complexation by major ions in seawater (eg. Ca 2+ ions).
 


Zinc complexation was also evident, however total zinc concentrations in the water column often far exceeded the potential binding capacity of available ligands. In          addition to organic complexation, Zn speciation may also be associated with adsorption by flocculated or resuspended colloidal Mn and/or Fe oxyhydroxides.

Metal ion complexation and hence speciation was found to be highly variable within the Pieman River catchment. This presents major difficulties for environmental managers,          as it is therefore not possible to make catchment-wide assumptions about the bioavailability of these metals. These results emphasise the importance of site-specific sampling protocols and speciation testing, ideally incorporating continuous, in situ monitoring.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">trace elements</field><field name="subject">trace elements in water</field><field name="subject">metals</field><field name="subject">Tasmania</field><field name="subject">environmental impacts</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20071107.111755</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Teenage techological experts: Bourdieu and the performance of expertise</field><field name="creator">Johnson, Nicola F.</field><field name="description">This thesis explores the construction of technological expertise amongst a heterogenous group of New Zealand teenagers, specifically in regard to their home computer use, which for many of them is their primary site of leisure. This thesis explores the field in which these teenagers are positioned, and explains the practice constituting that field. In this field, the trajectories towards expertise are explained including the time, experimentation, and pleasure evident in their praxis. 
The qualitative study involved observations and interviews with eight teenagers aged 13 &#150; 17. Five boys and three girls participated and each attended one of various secondary schools located within a provincial city in New Zealand. All of the participants considered themselves to be technological experts, and their peers and/or their family supported this comprehension. 
Drawing on Pierre Bourdieu&#146;s socio-cultural theories, the capital (cultural, economic, social) and habitus of the teenagers are described (habitus being what makes them who they are, and continues to define who they are in the future). Chapter five centres on explaining the field the teenagers have positioned themselves in, namely the field of out-of-school leisure and home computer use. It also explores the construction and performance of technological expertise within the field. 
Chapter six examines traditional views of schooling and expertise, and contrasts these views with what the teenagers think about their learning and expertise. This gap is specifically explained with regard to differences between the concepts and value of learning, expertise, and technology, and how they are recognised and valued differently between generations. 
Chapter seven explores the praxis that the participants exhibit, which is arguably misrecognized by those whose interests are in the established order (e.g. institutional, societal structures). The field they are placed in is arguably part of the broader field of education, yet the findings suggest their capital is misrecognized by digital newcomers, and therefore not legitimated. 
This thesis concludes that the gap between teenager and adult understandings of expertise is exacerbated in the digital world in which the teenagers position themselves. Their schooling is mainly positioned in the print culture of previous generations and consequently, in the lives of these teenagers, schooling has had little influence on the development of their technological expertise. Additionally, gender has had little impact in their development of expertise; therefore stereotypical notions of female underachievement as computer experts are contested.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">New Zealand teenagers</field><field name="subject">teenagers</field><field name="subject">teenager home computer use</field><field name="subject">Pierre Bourdieu&#146;s socio-cultural theories</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20071107.113906</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Attributes for Australian mechanical engineers through proximal and distance education</field><field name="creator">Ferguson, Clive</field><field name="description">The 1996 Johnson stakeholder review of Australian engineering education recommended the development of a number of broadly defined attributes in all engineering graduates. The Institution of Engineers, Australia (now Engineers Australia) responded swiftly by switching the focus of its engineering course accreditation requirements from course content to graduate attribute outcomes. 

To maximise the effectiveness of this approach to the mechanical engineering discipline a clear understanding of the relative significance of a more detailed range of attributes to Australian industry is essential, yet the scope of the mechanical engineering profession is broad and views of individual practitioners contributing to debate on attribute requirements are largely influenced by their own often unique professional formation. 

The research presented in this thesis is unique in using a role based analysis of the relative significance of an extensive range of attributes considered relevant to Australian mechanical engineers. The study covers the six industries found to employ the greatest number of Australian mechanical engineers. The significance of these attributes in the core mechanical engineering roles of each industry are weighted according to the numbers of mechanical engineers employed in those roles.     

These attribute significance profiles are considered in the context of a study of the formative development of the profession under the extensive influence of 19th and 20th century UK and US practices and recent momentous changes in engineering employment and formation.   

A wide range of appropriate teaching strategies to develop the most significant attributes through proximal and distance learning are explored and a brief account of the candidate&#146;s work in developing and assessing the use of technology to enhance flexible learning in the field of engineering education is also included in this thesis.

Whilst major areas of the mechanical engineers knowledge base are considered as part of the main study, further case study based research is presented to assess in more detail the knowledge base requirements for Australia&#146;s best performing manufacturing industry by &#145;industry value added&#146; - Food, Beverage and Pharmaceuticals and as such provides an indication of the relevance of the content base of Australian mechanical (as well as chemical and electrical) engineering degree programs to an Australian industry sector.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australian mechanical engineers</field><field name="subject">engineering knowledge</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20071107.115032</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Nutrient contribution to hyper-eutrophic wetlands in Perth, Western Australia</field><field name="creator">Burkett, Danny</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates nutrient contribution to six hyper-eutrophic lakes located within close proximity of each other on the Swan Coastal Plain and 20 kilometres south of the Perth Central Business District, Western Australia. The lakes are located within a mixed land use setting and are under the management of a number of state and local government departments and organisations. These are a number of other lakes on the Swan Coastal Plain for which the majority are less than 3 metres in depth and considered as an expression of the groundwater as their base is below the regional groundwater table throughout most of the year.  The limited amount of water quality data available for these six lakes and the surface water and groundwater flowing into them has restricted a thorough understanding of the processes influencing the water quality of the lakes. Various private and public companies and organisations have undertaken studies on some of the individual wetlands and there is a wide difference in scientific opinion as to the major source of the nutrients to those wetlands. These previous studies failed to consider regional surface water and groundwater effects on the nutrient fluxes and they predominantly only investigated single wetland systems.  This study attempts for the first time to investigate the regional contribution of nutrients to this system of wetlands existing on the Swan Coastal plain.  As such, it also includes new research on the nutrient contribution to some of the remaining wetlands. The research findings indicate that the lake sediments represent a considerable store of nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus).  These sediments in turn control the nutrient status of the lake's water column.  Surface water is found to contribute on an event-basis load of nutrients to the lakes whilst the groundwater surprisingly appears to contribute a comparatively low input of nutrients but governs the water depth. Analysis of the regional groundwater shows efficient denitrifying abilities as a result of denitrifying bacteria and the transport is localised. Management recommendations for the remediation of the social and environmental value of the lakes include treatment of the lake&#146;s sediments via chemical bonding or atmospheric oxidation; utilising the regional groundwater&#146;s denitrifying abilities to &#145;treat&#146; the surface water via infiltration basins; and investigating the merits of managed or artificial aquifer recharge (MAR).</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Wetland ecology</field><field name="subject">algal blooms</field><field name="subject">groundwater</field><field name="subject">groundwater ecology</field><field name="subject">Western Australian environment</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20071115.082506</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ecological value of riparian zones to birds in forest landscapes</field><field name="creator">Palmer, Grant Campbell</field><field name="description">Riparian zones are a characteristic component of many landscapes throughout the world and increasingly are valued as key areas for biodiversity conservation.  Their importance for bird communities has been well recognised in semi-arid environments and in modified landscapes where there is a marked contrast between riparian and adjacent non-riparian vegetation. The value of riparian zones in largely intact landscapes with continuous vegetation cover is less well understood. This research examined the importance of riparian habitats for avifauna conservation by investigating the ecological interactions contributing to the pattern of bird assemblages in riparian and adjacent non-riparian habitats. Specifically, the focus is on the bird assemblages of riparian zones and those of adjacent non-riparian vegetation types and the influence that associated differences in resource availabilities, habitat structure and conditions have on observed patterns. 
This study was conducted in the foothill forests of the Victorian Highlands, south-east Australia.  Mixed-species eucalypt (genus Eucalyptus) forests dominate the vegetation of this region. Site selection was based on the occurrence of suitable riparian habitat interspersed within extensive, relatively undisturbed (i.e. no recent timber harvesting or fire events) forest mosaics. A series of 30 paired riparian and non-riparian sites were established among six stream systems in three forest areas (Bunyip State Park, Kinglake National Park and Marysville State Forest).  Riparian sites were positioned alongside the stream and the non-riparian partner site was positioned on a facing slope at a distance of approximately 750 m.  Bird surveys were carried out during 29 visits to each site between July 2001 and December 2002. 
Riparian sites were floristically distinct from non-riparian sites and had a more complex vegetation structure, including a mid-storey tree layer mostly absent from non-riparian sites, extensive fine litter and coarse woody debris, and dense ground-layer vegetation 
(e.g. sedges and ground ferns). The characteristic features of non-riparian habitats included a relatively dense canopy cover, a ground layer dominated by grasses and fine litter, and a high density of canopy-forming trees in the smaller size-classes. 
Riparian zones supported a significantly greater species richness, abundance and 
diversity of birds when compared to non-riparian habitats. The composition of bird assemblages differed significantly between riparian and non-riparian habitats, with riparian assemblages displaying a higher level of similarity among sites.  The strongest contributors to observed dissimilarities between habitat types included species that occurred exclusively in either habitat type or species with large contrasts in abundance between habitat types.  Much of the avifauna (36%) of the study area is composed of species that are common and widespread in south-east Australia (i.e. forest generalists). Riparian habitats were characterised by a suite of species more typical of wetter forest types in south-east Australia and many of these species had a restricted distribution in the forest mosaic.  Some species (7%) occurred exclusively in riparian habitats (i.e. riparian selective species) while others (43%) were strongly linked to these habitats (i.e. riparian associated species).  A smaller proportion of species occurred exclusively (2%) in non-riparian habitats (i.e. non-riparian selective species) or were strongly linked to these habitats (10%; i.e. non-riparian associated species). 
To examine the seasonal dynamics of assemblages, the variation through time in species richness, abundance and composition was compared between riparian and non-riparian sites. Riparian assemblages supported greater richness and abundance, and displayed less variation in these parameters, than non-riparian assemblages at all times. The species composition of riparian assemblages was distinct from non-riparian assemblages throughout the annual cycle.  An influx of seasonal migrants elevated species richness and abundance in the forest landscape during spring and summer.  The large-scale movement pattern (e.g. coastal migrant, inland migrant) adopted by migrating species was associated with their preference for riparian or non-riparian habitats in the landscape.  Species which migrate north-south along the east coast of mainland Australia (i.e. coastal migrants) used riparian zones disproportionately; eight of eleven species were riparian associated species. Species which migrate north-south through inland Australia (i.e. inland migrants) were mostly associated with non-riparian habitats.  The significant differences in the dynamics of community structure between riparian and non-riparian assemblages shows that there is a disproportionate use of riparian zones across the landscape and that they provide higher quality habitat for birds throughout the annual cycle. 
To examine the ecological mechanisms by which riparian assemblages are richer and 
support more individual birds, the number of ecological groups (foraging, nest-type and body mass groups) represented, and the species richness of these groups, was compared between riparian and non-riparian assemblages.  The structurally complex vegetation and distinctive habitat features (e.g. aquatic environments, damp sheltered litter) provided in the riparian zone, resulted in the consistent addition of ecological groups to riparian assemblages (e.g. sheltered ground &#150; invertebrates foraging group) compared with non-riparian assemblages.  Greater species richness was accommodated in most foraging, nest-type and body mass groups in riparian than non-riparian assemblages. Riparian zones facilitated greater richness within ecological groups by providing conditions (i.e. more types of resources and greater abundance of resources) that promoted ecological segregation between ecologically similar species.  For a set of commonly observed species, significant differences in their use of structural features, substrates and heights were registered between riparian and non-riparian habitats.  
The availability and dynamics of resources in riparian and non-riparian habitats were examined to determine if there is differential availability of particular resources, or in their temporal availability, throughout the annual cycle.  Riparian zones supported more abundant and temporally reliable eucalypt flowering (i.e. nectar) than non-riparian habitats throughout the annual cycle. Riparian zones also supported an extensive loose bark resource (an important microhabitat for invertebrates) including more peeling bark and hanging bark throughout the year than at non-riparian sites. The productivity of eucalypts differed between habitat types, being higher in riparian zones at most times for all eucalypts combined, and for some species (e.g. Narrow-leaved Peppermint Eucalyptus radiata). Non-riparian habitats provided an abundant nectar resource (i.e. shrub flowering) at particular periods in the annual cycle.  Birds showed clear relationships with the availability of specific food (i.e. nectar) and foraging resources 
(i.e. loose bark).  The demonstration of a greater abundance of resources and higher primary productivity in riparian zones is consistent with the hypothesis that these linear strips that occupy only a small proportion of the landscape have a disproportionately high value for birds. 
Riparian zones in continuous eucalypt forest provide high quality habitats that contribute to the diversity of habitats and resources available to birds in the forest 
mosaic, with positive benefits for the landscape-level species pool.  Despite riparian and non-riparian habitat supporting distinct assemblages of birds, strong linkages are maintained along the riparian-upslope gradient.  Clearly, the maintenance of diverse and sustainable assemblages of birds in forest landscapes depends on complementary management of both riparian and non-riparian vegetation.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">riparian ecology</field><field name="subject">birds</field><field name="subject">ecology</field><field name="subject">eucalyptus</field><field name="subject">Australian birds</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20071115.083927</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Beyond the analogon;  the 'transfer of the referent' :bthe relationship between the external world experienced through culturally generated perceptual models constructed in the human mind, and the transfer of these images, via visual language, onto referents</field><field name="creator">Stewart, Heather</field><field name="description">Within 20th. Century art, the concept of the &#145;normative&#146; image, as an attribute of things, has been challenged. As a consequence, paintings must now picture the &#145;real&#146; world in other ways, incorporating knowledge and meaning beyond the analogon. Such descriptive representations were revealed as paradigmatic, rather than incontrovertible fact. Dependent on pre-conceived notions of stereotypicality, these descriptive images relied on surface illumination.

My thesis explores images of things in the world as culturally inspired and information based. I examine paintings and sculptures of other cultures, such as black African,          and other historical periods such as the Medieval, which reveal metonymously the           basis for variations in representations of the &#145;real&#146; world.

The new enhanced representations which Modern artists created in their work were denigrated as deviant from the absolute &#145;normative&#146; or regarded as distortions for purely mannerist and stylistic reasons. Postmodern research has reassessed them as multiple or extended imagings in whose facture new knowledge and human responses can be incorporated. These new forms of representation can be regarded as theoretical constructs rather than stylised depictions of appearance. In this way referents are transferred through the mind onto objects and vistas in the real world to align with our developed view of the physical world and better our understanding of humanity&#146;s symbiotic relationship with nature.</field><field name="date">1994</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Postmodernism</field><field name="subject">philosophy</field><field name="subject">pictorial works</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20071120.120343</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of water and surfactant in the solvent milling of wool</field><field name="creator">Wemyss, Andrew M.</field><field name="description">Unlike other fibres, wool felts readily when agitated         in the presence of water. For this reason, only the minimum necessary quantity of water is used when the garments are drycleaned. However, wool fibres are often deliberately              felted to obtain a warm bulky handle by controlled addition              of water to the solvent. This process is known as solvent  milling and recently, it has become a popular alternative to            the traditional milling in water alone. Although the               factors which influence milling in solvent are known, the relationships between them are not well defined.
A comprehensive study of the relationship between           water distribution and milling shrinkage during agitation of wool in perchloroethylene has been carried out in this                  thesis. The Karl Fischer method of determination was used throughout to establish the distribution of water between               the wool fibre and the solvent liquor. The emphasis was            placed on practical production variables.
The role of surfactant in affecting milling shrinkage through its effect on the transport of water to the fibre              from the solvent was examined. The ability of a suitable surfactant in promoting even and rapid sorption of water by            the fibre was related to the colloidal properties of the              milling liquor.</field><field name="date">1979</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Woollen and worsted manufacture</field><field name="subject">drycleaning</field><field name="subject">Wool scouring</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20071122.143812</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Conventions of pictorialism (iconic imagery, perceived space and the picture plane) deconstructed and reconstructed as alternative models of perception, embodied in paintings and drawings</field><field name="creator">Hodgkinson, Virginia</field><field name="description">This thesis is concerned with conventions of pictorialism, viz.            the surface of an artwork or the plane of denotation (in my case                paper, canvas or wood); and iconic imagery and the depiction of perceptual space that is connotated by marks, colours and forms            upon that surface.

The aim was to investigate and describe the relationship             between the remotely sensed data and the field data and to test the hypothesis that the remotely sensed                 data would establish further evidence of a limnological corridor of change running north-west to south-           east.

The airborne remotely sensed data consisted of data captured by the CSIRO Ocean Colour Scanner
(OCS) and a newly developed Canadian scanner, a compact airborne spectrographic imager (CASI).
The thesis investigates the relationship between the two kinds of data sources.

The remotely sensed data was collected with the OCS scanner in 1990 (during one day) and with both                the OCS and the CASI in 1993 (during three days). The OCS scanner registers data in 9 wavelength               bands between 380 nm and 960 nm with a 10-20 nm bandwidth, and the CASI in 288 wavelength                  bands between 379.57 nm and 893.5 nm (ie. spectral mode) with a spectral resolution of 2.5 nm. The remotely sensed data were extracted from the original tapes with the help of the CSIRO and supplied software and digital sample areas (band value means) for each lake were subsequently extracted for                 data manipulation and statistical analysis. Field data was captured concurrently with the remotely                  sensed data in 1993 by lake hopping using a light aircraft with floats. The field data used for analysis                with the remotely sensed data were the laboratory determined g440 values from the 1993 water samples collated with g440 values determined from earlier years. No spectro-radiometric data of the lakes, data                  of incoming irradiance or ancillary climatic data were captured during the remote sensing missions.

The sections of the background chapter in the thesis provide a background to the research both in                   regards to remote sensing of water quality and the relationship between remotely sensed spectral data                and water quality parameters, as well as a description of the Tasmanian lakes flown.

The lakes were divided into four groups based on results from previous studies and optical parameters, especially aquatic humus concentrations as measured from field captured data. The four groups consist             of the &#145;green&#148; clear water lakes mostly situated on the Central Plateau, the &#145;brown&#148; highly dystrophic          lakes in western Tasmania, the &#145;corridor&#148; lakes situated along a corridor of change lying                      approximately between the two lines denoting the Jurassic edge and 1200 mm isohyet, and the                    &#145;eastern, turbid&#148; lakes make up the fourth group.

The analytical part of the research work was mostly concerned with manipulating and analysing the                      CASI data because of its higher spectral resolution. The research explores methods to apply
corrections to this data to reduce the disturbing effects of varying illumination and atmospheric            conditions. Three different methods were attempted. In the first method two different standardisation formulas are applied to the data as well as &#145;day correction&#148; factors calculated from data from one of the lakes, Lake Rolleston, which had data captured for all three days of the remote sensing operations. The standardisation formulas were also applied to the OCS data. In second method an attempt to reduce the effects of the atmosphere was performed using spectro-radiometric captured in 1988 for one of the              lakes flown, Great Lake.  All the lake sample data were time normalised using general irradiance data obtained from the University of Tasmania and the sky portion as calculated from Great Lake upwelling irradiance data was then subtracted. The last method involved using two different band ratios to                eliminate atmospheric effects.

Statistical analysis was applied to the data resulting from the three methods to try to describe the relationship between the remotely sensed data and the field captured data. Discriminant analysis,                cluster analysis and factor analysis using principal component analysis (pea) were applied to the             remotely sensed data and the field data. The factor scores resulting from the pca were regressed                          against the field collated data of g440 as were the values resulting from last method.

The results from the statistical analysis of the data from the first method show that the lakes group well (100%) against the predetermined groups using discriminant analysis applied to the remotely sensed             CASI data. Most variance in the data are contained in the first factor resulting from pca regardless of              data manipulation method. Regression of the factor scores against g440 field data show a strong non-  linear relationship and a one-sided linear regression test is therefore considered an inappropriate                analysis method to describe the dataset relationships.

The research has shown that with the available data, correction and analysis methods, and within the             scope of the Masters study, it was not possible to establish the relationships between the remotely               sensed data and the field measured parameters as hoped. The main reason for this was the failure to   retrieve remotely sensed lake signatures adequately corrected for atmospheric noise for comparison             with the field data. This in turn is a result of the lack of detailed ancillary information needed to apply available established methods for noise reduction - to apply these methods we require field spectroradiometric measurements and environmental information of the varying conditions both within            the study area and within the time frame of capture of the remotely sensed data.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Tasmanian lakeland</field><field name="subject">remote sensing</field><field name="subject">limnology</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20071130.093144</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Diet and habitat of the powerful owl (Ninox strenua) living near Melbourne</field><field name="creator">Lavazanian, Elizabeth</field><field name="description">The diet of Powerful Owls (Ninox strenua) living at Christmas Hills, 35km north-east            of Melbourne was examined by analysis of 686 regurgitated pellets collected over two years.

-   Cross-sectional width of primary guard hairs.
-   The size and shape of the nasal, frontal, parietal and squamosal bones of the skull.
-   Dentition. The size and shape of the upper incisor, canine and premolar teeth. The            size and shape of the lower incisor and premolar teeth.
-   The size of the humerus. The Sugar Glider has a much smaller humerus than that of the  Common  Ringtail  Possum  and  the  Common  Brushtail  Possum.  In the Common Brushtail Possum the entepicondyle ends in a very sharp point but the Common              Ringtail Possum this point is not as sharp.
-  The Common Ringtail Possum&#146;s femur has a very prominent trochanter which         projects further than that in the Common Brushtail Possum. The femur of the Sugar Glider is distinguished by having a very large depression between the condyle and the trochanter.
-  The Common Brushtail Possum&#146;s scapula has a narrower lower blade (relative to length) than that in the Common Ringtail Possum. The scapula of the Sugar Glider is smaller in size than that of the other two possums.The pelvic girdle Of the Common Brushtail Possum has a much wider ischium than those of the Common Brushtail Possum and the Sugar Glider. The ilium of the Sugar             is much narrower and smaller than that of the other two possums
 

Mammalian prey was found in 89%, insects in 13% and birds in 10% of the pellets. Of the mammals, Common Ringtail Possums occurred most frequently in the pellets over  the year. There was no seasonal difference in the frequency of occurrence of Common Ringtail Possums and Sugar Gliders in pellets. However, Common Brushtail Possums were more likely to be taken in spring than in the other seasons. More adult Common Ringtail Possums were taken as prey than were other age classes over the year, except          in summer when high numbers of young were consumed by the owls.

The habitat of the Powerful Owl was examined by ground surveys and spotlight              surveys in sixteen sites within the Warrandyte-Kinglake Nature Conservation Link.                        Four categories of survey sites were chosen with the following features.

Category A - Sites with a dense understorey of shrubs and small trees, as well as many old trees (&gt;10/ha) which might be suitable for nest hollows. 
Category B - Sites which lacked a dense understorey of shrubs and small trees and containing few or no old trees suitable for nest hollows.
Category C - Sites with a dense understorey of shrubs and small trees but containing           few or no old trees suitable for nest hollows.
Category D - Sites which lacked a dense understorey of shrubs and small trees but  having old trees (&gt;10/ha) which might be suitable for nest hollows.

High prey densities strongly correlated with the presence of hollows at these sites.

In the light of the results, management recommendations were made for the future conservation of the Powerful Owls living at Christmas Hills. The following recommendations were particularly important:

1. Cleared or semi - cleared land within the Warrandyte Kinglake Nature Conservation Link be revegetated using indigenous species of eucalypts and waffles in order to
 

provide a contiguous native forest corridor for the movement of possums and gliders between the Yarra River Valley and the Kinglake Plateau.

2. Continued planting of Eucalyptus spp. and Acacia spp. in the forested areas of the Warrandyte-Kinglake Nature Conservation Link.

3. Continued protection of healthy living trees to provide a continuous supply of             hollow trees.

4. No falling of dead standing trees for firewood collecting as these can provide nest hollows for prey species of the Powerful Owl.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Powerful owls</field><field name="subject">owls</field><field name="subject">owl diets</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20071204.153147</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Indigenous values informing curriculum and pedagogical praxis</field><field name="creator">Williams, Shayne Thomas</field><field name="description">As an Indigenous research study into the cultural quality of Indigenous education this thesis focuses on the proposition that mainstream education marginalises Indigenous learners because of its entrenchment in the Western worldview.  The thesis opens with an analysis of the cultural dynamics of Indigenous values, the politics of Indigenous identity, and the hegemonic constraints of West-centric knowledge.  This analysis is then drawn upon to critically examine the cultural predisposition of mainstream education.  The arguments proffered through this critical examination support the case that Indigenous learners would prosper culturally and educationally by having access to educational programmes centred within an Indigenous cultural framework, thereby addressing the dilemma of lower Indigenous retentions rates. 

This research study was conducted using a qualitative Indigenous methodology specifically designed by the researcher to reflect the values and cultural priorities of Indigenous Australians. Collective partnership was sought from Indigenous Australians, whom the researcher respected as Indigenous stakeholders in the research.  Collegial participation was also sought from non-Indigenous educators with significant experience in teaching Indigenous learners.  The research process involved both individual and group sessions of dialogic exchange.  With regard to the Indigenous sessions of dialogic exchange, these resulted in the formation of a composite narrative wherein Indigenous testimony was united to create a collective Indigenous voice.

Through this research study it was revealed that there is indeed a stark and deep-seated contrast between the value systems of Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australia.  This contrast, it was found, is mirrored in the cultural dynamics of education and the polemics of knowledge legitimacy.  The research also revealed that Australia&#146;s mainstream education system is intractably an agent for the promulgation of Western cultural values, and as such is culturally disenfranchising to Indigenous peoples.  This thesis then concludes with an alternative and culturally apposite education paradigm for Indigenous education premised on Indigenous values informing curriculum and pedagogical praxis.  This paradigm specifically supports independent Indigenous education initiatives.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Aboriginal Australians</field><field name="subject">education</field><field name="subject">culture conflict</field><field name="subject">research</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20071130.095612</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Technology adoption : voices of teaching academics, educational designers and students</field><field name="creator">Samarawickrema, Ramya Gayani</field><field name="description">This folio presents three studies (a dissertation and two electives) which use qualitative case study methodologies to investigate technology adoption from three perspectives. Central to all three studies is the study context of Monash University.

The Dissertation explores adoption of web-based learning and teaching approaches from the perspective of teaching academics as they incorporate these to facilitate their students&#146; learning. The study investigates teaching academics&#146; reasons for adopting these new technologies, the factors that influenced their adoption decisions, and the challenges they were confronted with, including the contributing factors that impacted on their adoption decisions. The study shows that while contextual factors such as power and politics of the school, department, faculty and the institution impact on adoption, supportive organisational infrastructures and policy frameworks are necessary to encourage adoption, including wider adoption. In turn, on going staff development, adoption of new work practices and being adaptive to changing work environments are key demands made on teaching academics as a result of adopting web-based teaching approaches.  

Elective 1, a smaller study, leads on from the dissertation and examines the impact of technology adoption on the evolving role of educational designers. The study identifies the educational designers&#146; role change in assisting teaching academics to move from more conventional forms of teaching to more technology based learner-centred collaborative models. An important aspect of the study is the managers&#146; perspectives of this role in a university that has adopted a strong flexible learning and technology policy. The findings show that educational designers now work as project managers in larger teams consisting of a wider range of professionals, their expanded role in introducing technology into learning designs, providing staff development in the area, and giving technical help including advice on copyright and intellectual property issues.  

Elective 2 explores student readiness to adopt these technologies for learning. The study is designed to achieve an understanding of three broad categories of learners from a first year design unit: (1) South East Asian and East Asian students, (2) all other international students, and (3) local Australian students are studied to examine their readiness for modes of learning that are flexible; their approaches to study in a creative discipline area; and their openness to using technology. Findings of the study are discussed under the key themes &#150; dependence on the teacher and classroom environment, flexible learning and working alone, structure, communication and work patterns. The study concludes by discussing the possible cultural attributes that have an impact on the learning.  

The three studies found that the institution, its people, structures and processes must all adapt, evolve and grow in order to provide effective, engaging, student-centred web-based learning environments. Students in turn must be enabled to manage their study, make use of the technologies and maximise their learning experience. The findings revealed the stage of technology use reached at Monash University at the time of the study through the voices of the teaching academics, educational designers and students.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Monash University</field><field name="subject">web-based instruction</field><field name="subject">internet in education</field><field name="subject">teaching</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20080404.104044</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Factors affecting the engagement of experienced teachers in schools</field><field name="creator">Carter, Pauline J</field><field name="description">With the changing age profile of teachers in Australian schools, considerable numbers of experienced teachers need to feature as educational leaders, before their workplace knowledge and expertise will be lost to schools with retirement. Stereotypes of veteran teachers depict individuals, wearied by decades of work experiences, entering professional decline when educational systems need these experienced practitioners to remain connected, communicative and motivated in their work.
This thesis explores the careers and contemporary professional lives of experienced practitioners &#151; predominantly classroom teachers &#151; currently working in a school with a long standing commitment to student-centred education. The research identified the factors that influenced their career pathways and affected their engagement with their work. Critical incidents in the teachers&#146; careers and professional lives are discussed in relation to the theories of motivation and the nature of Professional Learning Communities. The study showed that necessary factors for engagement were: mutual alignment with a well-articulated and practised ethos; supportive leadership; experiencing professional influence; opportunities for learning; and variety in work. Disillusion resulted if school actions were contrary to the espoused ethos. Severely negative experiences of performance management were survived by withdrawing, and enduring management tenures but these remain very poignant memories. The teachers had few career regrets yet reflection revealed the arbitrary nature of their career progression. 
The research identified a need to recognise the global and societal factors influencing the nature of teachers&#146; work. It is argued that schools and systems need to have a greater alignment between these external forces and their internal goals whilst recapturing the moral purpose of education. Furthermore, it is asserted that educational systems need to provide better human resource management for the teaching workforce through emphasising life-balance and well-being. Additionally, professional appraisal and staff management would benefit from strong recognition and deployment of the workplace knowledge and expertise of experienced teachers. A serendipitous outcome of the research was the benefit participants gained from reflecting on their careers which proved extremely affirming, and contributed to enhanced professional identities and changed career plans.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">High school teachers</field><field name="subject">teaching in Australia</field><field name="subject">High school teaching</field><field name="subject">seacondary schools teaching</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20080404.105756</field></doc><doc><field name="title">On-campus students' learning in asynchronous environments</field><field name="creator">Gerbic, Philippa</field><field name="description">Asynchronous online discussions have the potential to improve learning in   universities. This thesis reports an investigation into the ways in which         undergraduates learned in online discussions when they were included within their face-to-face courses. Taking a student perspective, four case studies describe and explain the approaches to learning that were used by business undergraduates in    online discussions, and examine the influence of the computer-mediated     conferencing (CMC) medium and curriculum design on student learning.

The investigation took a qualitative approach where case studies were developed     from multiple data sources. In each of the cases, a description of the setting of the online discussions introduced the learning environment. Further details of student learning behaviours in the online discussions were provided by an analysis of the systems data and a content analysis of the online discussion transcripts. In depth interpretation of interview data added student perspectives on the impact of CMC characteristics, the curriculum or learning design and the relationship between the online discussions and face-to-face classes. A comparative cross case analysis of the findings of the four cases identified and discussed general themes and broad    principles arising from the cases.

The campus-based students acknowledged that online discussions helped them to          learn and their message postings evidenced deep approaches to learning. The          students recognised the value for learning of the text based nature of the CMC environment but peer interaction was more difficult to achieve. Asynchronicity         created time flexibility and time for reflection but it also presented time management problems for many undergraduates. Assessment was the most influential aspect of        the curriculum design. The cases also identified the importance of a dialogical           activity and the absence of the teacher from the online discussions was not  problematic. The research identified new perspectives on the relationship between online discussions and face-to-face classes. Students regarded these two media as complementary rather than oppositional and affirmed the importance of pedagogic connections between them. A teaching and learning framework for online           discussions was developed from these perspectives.

The significance of this study lies in improved knowledge of student learning  processes in online discussions in blended learning environments. The cases            indicated the potential value of the CMC environment for constructivist philosophies and affirm the significant role of curriculum design with new technologies. Findings relating to the complementary nature of online and face to face discussions provided           a platform for building a teaching and learning framework for blended environments which can be used to inform and improve pedagogical design, teacher expertise and student learning outcomes in asynchronous online discussions.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Internet in higher education</field><field name="subject">Educational technology</field><field name="subject">computer conferencing</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20080421.153614</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Heavy metal accumulation in soils at three field sites subject to effluent irrigation.</field><field name="creator">Xiong, Xianzhe</field><field name="description">Three field sites were chosen to study the environmental assimilative capacity of heavy metals in soil. These sites were the Werribee Farm and the Myome Farm in Australia and Shenyang Zhangshi Irrigation Area in China. The Werribee Farm and the Shenyang Zhangshi Irrigation Area received sewage treatment and application on land for a long time. The Myome farm is an experimental site in which investigations on land application of municipal wastewater on water repellent soils is currently being trailed.
Heavy metal contamination, in particular Cr, Cu and Zn, in the Land Filtration soil of Werribee Farm was widespread. More than a century of sewage irrigation has occurred in the Werribee Farm. The temporal distribution pattern of heavy metals (Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb and Zn) in the soil at this site follow an exponential trend with time and the spatial distribution pattern of accumulation of heavy metals in different paddocks correlates with the number of years of sewage irrigation at that site in the Farm.
Extensive sewage irrigation at Shenyang Zhangshi Irrigation Area resulted in significant Cd pollution in soil-plant (rice) system and poses a significant threat to the health of local people. Even after eight years since cessation of sewage irrigation, the bioavailable fractions of Cd in the soil as analyzed by sequential extraction techniques were very high thus illustrating long-term persistence.
The simultaneous competitive adsorption of metals in water repellent soils (at Myome Farm in South Australia) was studied. In the competitive situation, Cr, Pb and Cu are the heavy metal cations more strongly adsorbed by the soil, whereas Cd, Ni and Zn are the least adsorbed. The increase in Freundlich adsorption capacity by clay amendment suggested that clayed soils are capable sorption of higher heavy metal loadings compared to the non-clayed water repellent soil, which is more vulnerable to heavy metal inputs.
A simple model of environmental assimilative capacity is proposed. The results of comparison of the three field sites shows that the Werribee Farm has a higher environmental assimilative capacity of heavy metals in soil than the soils at Shenyang Zhangshi Irrigation Area and Myome Farm, however heavy metal contamination at Werribee Farm is still a concern. The model of environmental assimilative capacity of heavy metals in soil is an effective tool to assist management of effluent applied land irrigation systems and can be used to better design environmental engineering systems.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">soil chemistry</field><field name="subject">soils</field><field name="subject">heavy metal content</field><field name="subject">heavy metals</field><field name="subject">environmental aspects</field><field name="subject">soil pollution</field><field name="subject">sewage irrigation</field><field name="subject">China</field><field name="subject">Shenyang Zhangshi irrigation area</field><field name="subject">Werribee Farm</field><field name="subject">Myome Farm</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20050902.110403</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Applying outcomes of lifelong learning to organisational achievement</field><field name="creator">Hughes, Lewis Bernard</field><field name="description">The focus of this doctoral research study is making the most what a person knows and can do, as an outcome from their lifelong learning, so as to better contribute to organisational achievement. This has been motivated by a perceived gap in the extensive literature linking knowledge with organisational achievement. Whereas there is a rich body of literature addressing the meta-philosophies giving rise to the emergence of learning organisations there is, as yet, scant attention paid to the detail of planning and implementing action which would reveal individual/organisational opportunities of mutual advantage and motivate, and sustain, participation at the day-to-day level of the individual. It is in this space that this dissertation seeks to contribute by offering a mechanism for bringing the, hindsight informed, response &#147;but that&#146;s obvious&#148; into the abiding explicit realm at the level of the individual.  

In moving beyond the obvious which is prone to be overlooked, the emphasis on &#147;better&#148; in the introductory sentence, is very deliberately made and has a link to awakening latent individual, and hence organisational, capabilities that would otherwise languish. The evolved LCM Model &#150; a purposeful integration valuing the outcomes from lifelong learning (the L) with nurturing a culture supporting this outcome (the C) and with responsiveness to potentially diverse motivations (the M) &#150; is a reflective device for bringing otherwise tacit, and latent, logic into the explicit realm of action. 

In the course of the development of the model, a number of supplementary models included in this dissertation have evolved from the research. They form a suite of devices which inform action and lead to making the most of what an individual knows and can do within the formal requirements of a job and within the informal influences of a frequently invisible community of practice.  

The initial inquiry drew upon the views and experiences of water industry engineering personnel and training facilitators associated with the contract cleaning and waste management industries. However, the major research occurred as an Emergency Management Australia (EMA) project with the Country Fire Authority (CFA) as the host organisation. This EMA/CFA research project explored the influence of making the most of what a CFA volunteer knows and can do upon retention of that volunteer. In its aggregate, across the CFA volunteer body, retention is a critical community safety objective.

A qualitative research, ethnographic in character, approach was adopted. Data was collected through interviews, workshops and outcomes from attempts at action research projects. Following an initial thirteen month scoping study including respondents other than from the CFA, the research study moved into an exploration of the efficacy of an indicative model with four contextual foci &#150; i.e. the manner of welcoming new members to the CFA, embracing training, strengthening brigade sustainability and leadership. Interestingly, the research environment which forced a truncated implementation of action research projects was, in itself, an informing experience indicative of inhibitors to making the most of what people know and can do. Competition for interest, time and commitment were factors governing the manner in which CFA respondents could be called upon to explore the efficacy of the model, and were a harbinger of the influences shaping the more general environment of drawing upon what CFA volunteers know and can do. 

Subsequent to the development of the indicative model, a further 16 month period was utilised in the ethnographic exploration of the relevance of the model within the CFA as the host organisation. As a consequence, the model is a more fully developed tool (framework) to aid reflection, planning and action. Importantly, the later phase of the research study has, through application of the model to specific goals within the CFA, yielded operational insight into its effective use, and in which activity systems have an important place.


The model &#150; now confidently styled as the LCM Model &#150; has three elements that when enmeshed strengthen the likelihood of organisational achievement ; and the degree of this meshing, as relevant to the target outcome, determines the strength of outcome. i.e. - 

&#149;	Valuing outcomes from learning: 
When a person recognises and values (appropriately to achievement by the organisation) what they know and can do, and associated others recognise and value what this person knows and can do, then there is increased likelihood of these outcomes from learning being applied to organisational achievement.

&#149;	Valuing a culture that is conducive to learning:
When a person, and associated others, are further developing and drawing upon what they know and can do within the context of a culture that is conducive to learning, then there is increased likelihood that outcomes from learning will be applied to organisational achievement.

&#149;	Valuing motivation of the individual:
When a person&#146;s motivation to apply what they know and can do is valued by them, and associated others, as appropriate to organisational achievement then there is increased likelihood that appropriately drawing upon outcomes from learning will occur.


Activity theory was employed as a device to scope and explore understanding of the issues as they emerged in the course of the research study. Viewing the data through the prism of activity theory led not only to the development of the LCM Model but also to an enhanced understanding of the role of leadership as a foundation for acting upon the model. 

Both formal and informal leadership were found to be germane in asserting influence on empowering engagement with learning and drawing upon its outcomes. It is apparent that a &#147;leaderful organisation&#148;, as postulated by Raelin (2003), is an environment which supports drawing upon the LCM model; and it may be the case that the act of drawing upon the model will move a narrowly leadership focused organisation toward leaderful attributes.

As foreshadowed at the beginning of this synopsis, nurturing individual and organisational capability is the guiding mantra for this dissertation - &#147;Capability embraces competence but is also forward-looking, concerned with the realisation of potential&#148; (Stephenson 1998, p. 3). Although the inquiry focussed upon a need for CFA volunteer retention, it began with a broader investigation as part of the scoping foundation and the expanded usefulness of the LCM Model invites further investigation.

The dissertation concludes with the encapsulating sentiment that &#147;You have really got to want to&#148;. With this predisposition in mind, this dissertation contributes to knowledge through the development and discussion of the LCM model as a reflective device informing transformative learning (Mezirow and Associates 1990). A leaderful environment (Raelin 2003) aids transformative learning &#150; accruing to the individual and the organisation - through engendering and maintaining making the most of knowledge and skill &#150; motivating and sustaining &#147;the will&#148;. 

The outcomes from this research study are a strong assertion that wanting to make the most of what is known and can be done is a hallmark of capability. Accordingly, this dissertation is a contribution to the &#147;how&#148; of strengthening the capability, and the commitment to applying that capability, of an individual and an organisation.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">lifelong learning</field><field name="subject">organizational effectivess</field><field name="subject">continuing education</field><field name="subject">social aspects of learning</field><field name="subject">Country Fire Authority</field><field name="subject">Volunteer fire fighters</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20080521.085701</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Information skills and the distance education student : An exploratory study into the approaches of Southern Cross University distance educators to the information needs of external students</field><field name="creator">Phelps, Renata</field><field name="description">This study unites the concepts of self-directed learning and information literacy in the external higher education environment.

One good potential source of football injury data is sports medicine clinics. Analysis of injury presentations to sports medicine clinics was undertaken to provide a detailed description of the epidemiology of Australian football injuries that present to this         treatment setting and to determine the implications for injury prevention in this sport. In addition, the data from sports medicine clinics was compared with existing sources of Australian football injury data to determine how representative sports medicine clinic        data is of other football injury data sources and to provide recommendations for future injury surveillance n Australian football.

The results contained in this thesis show that Australian football is the sport most associated with injury presentation at sports medicine clinics. The majority of injured Australian football players presenting to sports medicine clinics are community-level or junior participants which suggests that sports medicine clinics are a good source of information on the injuries sustained by sub-elite football participants.

Competition is the most common context in which Australian football players presenting  to sports medicine clinics are injured. The major causes of injuries to Australian          football players are being struck by another player, collisions and overuse. Injuries to Australian football players predominantly involve the lower limb. Adult players, players who stopped participating immediately after noticing their injury and players with         overuse injuries are the most likely to sustain a more severe injury (i.e. more than four weeks before a full return to football participation and a moderate/significant amount of treatment expected). The least experienced players (five or less years of participation)            are more likely to require a significant amount of treatment than the more experienced players.

The prevention of lower limb injuries, injuries caused by body contact and injuries           caused by overuse should be a priority for injury prevention research in Australian
football due to the predominance of these injury types in the pattern of Australian            football injuries Additionally, adult players, as a group, should be a focus of injury prevention activities in Australian football due to the association between age and         injury severity.
Overall, the pattern of Australian football injuries presenting to sports medicine clinics appears to be different than reported by club-based and hospital emergency              department injury surveillance activities. However, detailed comparison of sports            medicine clinic Australian football data with other sources of Australian football injury data is difficult due to the variable methods of collecting and reporting injury information used by hospital emergency department and club-based injury surveillance activities.             The development of a standardised method for collecting and reporting injury data in Australian football is strongly recommended to overcome the existing limitations of data collection in this sport.
In summary, sports medicine clinics provide a rich source of Australian football injury data, especially from the community and junior levels of participation. The inclusion of sports medicine clinic data provides a broader epidemiological picture of Australian football injuries. This broader understanding of the pattern of Australian football             injuries provides a better basis for the development of injury prevention measures in            this sport.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sport injuries</field><field name="subject">Australian Rules Football</field><field name="subject">AFL</field><field name="subject">VFL</field><field name="subject">Australian football</field><field name="subject">sports medicine</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20080603.160908</field></doc><doc><field name="title">N3-substituted xanthines as irreversible adenosine receptor antagonists</field><field name="creator">Beauglehole, Anthony Robert</field><field name="description">8-Cyclopentyl-3-(3-(4-fluorosulfonylbenzoyl)oxy)propyl-propylxanthine (44, FSCPX) has been reported to exhibit potent and selective irreversible antagonism of the              A1 adenosine receptor when using in vitro biological preparations. However, FSCPX              (44) suffers from cleavage of the ester linkage separating the reactive                                           4-(fluorosulfonyl)phenyl moiety from the xanthine pharmacophore when used in in vivo biological preparations or preparations containing significant enzyme activity,                  presumably by esterases. Cleavage of the ester linkage renders FSCPX (44) inactive in            terms of irreversible receptor binding. In order to obtain an irreversible A1 adenosine  receptor antagonist with improved stability, and to further elucidate the effects of linker structure on pharmacological characteristics, several FSCPX (44) analogues              incorporating the chemoreactive 4-(fluorosulfonyl)phenyl moiety were targeted, where           the labile ester linkage has been replaced by more stable functionalites. In particular,               ether, alkyl, amide and ketone linkers were targeted, where the length of the alkyl chain              was varied from between one to five atoms.

	Synthesis of the target compounds was achieved via direct attachment of the N-3 substituent to the xanthine. These compounds were then tested for their biological                   activity at the A1 adenosine receptor via their ability to irreversibly antagonise the                  binding of [3H]-8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine ([3H]DPCPX, ( 9) to the A1             adenosine receptor of DDT1 MF-2 cells. For comparison, the xanthines were also tested              for their ability to inhibit the binding of [3H]-4-(2-[7-amino-2-{furyl} {1,2,4}-             triazolo{2,3-a} {1,3,5}triazin-5-ylamino-ethyl)]phenol ([3H]ZM241385, 36) to the A2A adenosine receptor of PC-12 cells. The results suggest that the length and chemical composition of the linker separating the reactive 4-(fluorosulfonyl)phenyl moiety from              the xanthine ring contribute to the potency and efficacy of the irreversible A1 adenosine receptor ligands. Like FSCPX (44, IC50 A1 = 11.8 nM), all derivatives possessed IC50             values in the low nM range under in vitro conditions. Compounds 94 (IC50 A1 = 165                   nM), 95 (IC50 A1 = 112 nM) and 96 (IC50 A1 = 101 nM) possessing one, three and five methylene spacers within the linkage respectively, exhibited potent and selective                   binding to the A1 adenosine receptor versus the A2A adenosine receptor. Compound 94              did not exhibit any irreversible binding at A1 adenosine receptors, while 95 and 96                 exhibit only weak irreversible binding at A1 adenosine receptors. Those compounds containing a benzylic carbonyl separating the 4-(fluorosulfonyl)phenyl moiety from the xanthine ring in the form of an amide (119, IC50 A1 = 24.9 nM, and 120, IC50 A1 = 21              nM) or ketone (151, IC50 A1 = 14 nM) proved to be the most potent, with compound                120 exhibiting the highest selectivity of 132-fold for the A receptor over the A2A               receptor. compounds 119, 120 and 151 also strongly inhibited the binding of                                  [3H]DPCPX irreversibly (82%, 83% and 78% loss of [3H]DPCPX binding at 100 nM respectively). compounds 120 and 151 are currently being evaluated for use in in vivo studies.

	Structure-activity studies suggest that altering the 8-cycloalkyl group of A1 selective xanthines for a 3-substituted or 2,3-disubstituted styryl, combined with N-7             methyl substitution will produce a compound with high affinity and selectivity for the             A2A adenosine receptor over the A1 adenosine receptor. Compound 167 (IC50 A2A = 264             nM) possessing 8-(m-chloro)styryl substitution and the reactive                                                      4-(fluorosulfonyl)phenyl moiety separated from the xanthine ring via an amide linker in            the 3-position (as for 119 and 120), exhibited relatively potent binding to the A2A               adenosine receptor of PC-12 cells, with a 16-fold selectivity for that receptor over the                 A1 adenosine receptor. However, compound 167 exhibited only very weak irreversible binding at A2A adenosine receptors.

	Overall, at this stage of biological testing, compound 120 appears to possess the most advantageous characteristics as an irreversible antagonist for the A1 adenosine   receptor. This can be attributed to its high selectivity for the A1 adenosine receptor as compared to the A2A adenosine receptor. It also has relatively high potency for the A1 adenosine receptor, a concentration-dependent and selective inactivation of A1                 adenosine receptors, and unbound ligand is easily removed (washed out) from                  biological membranes. These characteristics mean compound 151 has the potential to                    be a useful tool for the further study of the structure and function of the A1 adenosine receptor.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">adenosine</field><field name="subject">cardiac receptors</field><field name="subject">antagonists</field><field name="subject">physiological effect</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20080612.084330</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An evaluation of Australian undergraduate engineering management education for flexible delivery</field><field name="creator">Palmer, Stuart Rohan</field><field name="description">This thesis examines issues in Australian undergraduate engineering management studies in the context of flexible learning delivery. It is proposed that, within an Australian context:
a)  the management skills and competencies required by graduate engineers can be determined and classified on a rational basis, permitting an educational focus on those elements most appropriate for graduates; and
b)  on-line and other computer-based technologies are a practical and effective method for the support of undergraduate engineering management studies.
The doctoral project incorporates:
&#149;    an examination of the nature of engineering management;
&#149;    a review of the relevant literature establishing the importance of management studies in undergraduate engineering courses;
&#149;    a review of historical and recent developments in Australian undergraduate engineering management studies;
&#149;    an investigation of the management skills and competencies required by graduate engineers - based on original research;
&#149;    an examination of flexible delivery of engineering education - based on professional practice experience; and
&#149;    an evaluation of case studies of flexible delivery of engineering management education - based on original research and professional practice experience.
A framework of ranked classified management skills is developed. Broadly, the ranking framework is generic professional skills, followed by general management skills and technical discipline specific management skills, followed by other professional discipline skills and theoretical skills. This framework provides a rational basis for design of undergraduate engineering management studies. This is supplemented by consideration of the management skills required for the future of engineering practice.
 
It is concluded that undergraduate engineering management education is well suited to delivery and support by on-line and computer-based technology. Recent developments in improved access to the Internet, software systems for on-line collaboration and changes in copyright legislation to create a broad-based right to communication via on-line media have contributed to the facilitation of on-line delivery of teaching and learning. It is noted that though many on-line infrastructure issues have been satisfactorily resolved, higher level issues will emerge as being crucial, including the academic staff development and reward for operating in an online teaching environment and the financial sustainability of on-line development and delivery of courses.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Engineers</field><field name="subject">education</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">training of engineers</field><field name="subject">engineering</field><field name="subject">management study and teaching</field><field name="subject">distance education</field><field name="subject">computer-assisted instruction</field><field name="subject">information technology</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20050815.112159</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of monoclonal antibodies against Vibrio pathogens</field><field name="creator">Chen, Desheng</field><field name="description">Monoclonal antibodies were developed against pathogenic vibrios for use                      in rapid identification in disease situations of humans, fish and                                           shellfish. Of the 12 fusions performed using V. alginolyticus, V.                        anguillarum, V. carchariae, V. cholerae, V. damsela, V. furnissii, V.                                  harveyi, V. ordalii, V. parahaemolyticus and V. vulnificus, a total of                                 102  hybridomas were obtained. Based on cross-reactivity of a wide range                            of Vibrio strains and other gram-negative bacteria, three broad types of               monoclonal antibodies were found. The three categories were: (1) ones                                that were species-specific or specific to a particular surface antigen,                                   (2) a large number that reacted with several Vibrio species, and (3)                                three that reacted with most Vibrio strains but no other gram-negative                      bacteria.

Each species-specific monoclonal antibody only recognized its                         corresponding Vibrio species and was used for identifying unknown                        species, confirming diagnosis of clinical isolates. In addition,                                    several monoclonal antibodies only cross-reacted with similar Vibrio           species, e.g. V. parahaemolyticus and V. alginolyticus which share a                common H-antigen. Monoclonal antibodies reacting with several Vibrio species were not of particular use in diagnostic situations. Three           monoclonal antibodies of the last group did not react with other genera            of the family Vibrionaceae, namely Aeromonas, Photobacterium and                   Plesiomonas nor a wide range of gram-negative enteric bacteria. These             data indicated the existence of an antigenic surface determinant common              to Vibrio species. One monoclonal reacted with the heat-stable                  antigenic determinants on the cell surface as v as lipopolysaccharide         extracted from all the vibrios studied, thus making it useful for large-               scale screening of acute infections of vibrios.

In a blind test, seven Vibrio species, isolated from 6 marine and a           freshwater source were identified by two laboratories using phenetic                tests. Results of immunotyping using monoclonals, three of seven were diagnosed as the same species, another three were designated as Vibrio species but could not be classified further due to the library not                         having the corresponding monoclonal, and one was diagnostically questionable. Two further tests were carried out. An unknown Vibrio formalin-fixed   isolated   from   diseased   marine   animal   was  identified  as                       

V. parahaemolyticus by ELISA and FITC. Clinical human isolates of V.            alginolyticus, V. parahaemolyticus and V. vulnificus were confirmed by monoclonals.

Australian isolates of V. anguillarum appeared to be mostly of serotype              O1. monoclonals raised to V. anguillarum AFHRL 1 reacted with only serotype O1 from Denmark but also most Australian isolates.

All vibrios pathogenic to fish and shellfish, i.e. V. anguillarum, V.                 ordalii, V. alginolyticus, V. carchariae, V. cholerae, V. damsela, V.              harveyi, V. parahaemolyticus and V. vulnificus, were used for attachment studies to fish cells using phase contrast and FITC-immunofluorescence microscopy. Of these vibrios, V. anguillarum, V. ordalii and V. perahaemolyticus, were found to adhere to different cells and tissues of rainbow trout while others did not appear to attach. However,                   attachment was inhibited by monoclonal antibodies specific to only these three vibrios.

Lipopolysaccharide is well known as being a contributing factor in pathogenicity of gram-negative bacteria. PAGE electrophoresis of              extracted LPS from 9 strains covering 6 Vibrio species showed the             presence of a common 15,000 D fragment. This fragment was verified by immunoblotting with a genus-specific monoclonal antibody (i.e. F11P411F) recognizing nearly all vibrios. The common LPS fragment was separated            and used to raise polyclonal antisera in mouse which reacted strongly         with LPS itself, live as well as sodium azide-killed vibrios, but not                 with other gram-negative bacteria. This raised the possibility of               developing vaccine from Vibrio LPS.

Monoclonal antibodies developed in the present study enabled rapid identification of a number of pathogenic Vibrio species. There is still             further work to produce monoclonal antibodies against additional vibrios         that are probably pathogenic. These included V. fluvialis, V. hollisae,                V. metschnikovii, V. minicus, V. salmonella and V. tubiashii. Together              the application will be of significance in clinical diagnostic work, in                 the monitoring of vibriosis in fish farms and in quarantine.</field><field name="date">1991</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">monoclonial antibodies</field><field name="subject">vibrios</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20080626.140825</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Contestation and continuity in educational reform: A critical study of innovations in environmental education</field><field name="creator">Robottom, Ian Morris</field><field name="description">This study explores the notion of contestation in environmental education. Contestation is a process in which self-interested individuals and groups in a social organisation cooperate, compete and negotiate in a complex interaction aimed at solving social problems. A "framework for critique" is developed, comprising technicist, liberal&lt;interpretive and critical paradigms in each of scientific knowledge, educational innovation, educational research and education itself. This framework forms the basis from which a critique is mounted of contesting perspectives in environmental education at international, national and local levels.
The thesis argues, firstly, that contestation takes place in the domains of
(a) language or "policy in environmental education;
(b) organisational strategies aimed at initiating or improving environmental education;
(c) educational practices conducted in the name of environmental education; and
(d) within perspectives between these domains.
The thesis argues, secondly, that the presently dominant techniqist models of innovation expressed in the organisation of environmental education are part of an hegemonic relationship which acts to "technologise" the innovation: they provide an organisational strategy for establishing environmental and educational progress without offering a theory for self-reflection and ideology-critique. The incompatibility of certain contesting perspectives and practices is masked, thus contributing to continuity, rather than reform.
The thesis characterises this "educational problem of environmental education" as a series of theory-practice gaps at all levels, where "theory" is the set of beliefs and assumptions held by individual practitioners, and in. terms of which they understand their educational practices. An educational problem exists because these theory-practice gaps exist; the educational problem continues because these theory-practice gaps exist unacknowledged within the infrastructure of environmental  education due to the effects of false consciousness and hegemony.
The thesis addresses the issue of which of several contesting forms of educational research offers the most coherent response to the educational problem of environmental education, and argues that, for the time being, approaches grounded in the critical social sciences are both the best justified and most promising approaches . to educational research for environmental education.</field><field name="date">1985</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">contestation in environmental education</field><field name="subject">self-interested individuals</field><field name="subject">compete</field><field name="subject">negotiate</field><field name="subject">social problems</field><field name="subject">framework</field><field name="subject">critique</field><field name="subject">liberal&lt;interpretive</field><field name="subject">language</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20031126.092202</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The 1859 election on the Ovens</field><field name="creator">O'Brien, Antony</field><field name="description">The Victorian general election of 1859 occurred during a time of social transition and electoral reformation, which extended the vote to previously unrepresented adult males. Gold discoveries, including those on the Ovens, triggered the miners&#146; insistent demands for access to land and participation in the political process.

The thesis identifies issues, which emerged during the election campaign         on the Ovens goldfields, surrounding Beechworth. The struggle centred on the two Legislative Assembly seats for the Ovens and the one Legislative Council seat for the Murray District. Though the declared election issue  was land reform, it concealed a range of underlying tensions, which        divided the electorate along lines of nationality and religion. Complicating these tensions within the European community was the Chinese presence throughout the Ovens. The thesis suggests the historical memory of the French Revolution, the European Revolutions of 1848 and the Catholic versus Protestant revivals divided the Ovens goldfield community. The competing groups formed alliances; a Beechworth-centred grouping of traders, merchants and the Constitution&#146;s editor, ensured the existing conservative agenda triumphed over those perceived radicals who sought reform. In the process the land hungry miners did not gain any political representation in the Legislative Assembly, while a prominent Catholic squatter who advocated limited land reform was defeated for the Legislative Council seat.

Two daily Beechworth papers, Ovens and Murray Advertiser and its fierce competitor, the Constitution and Ovens Mining Intelligencer are the major primary sources for the thesis.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Parliament of Victoria</field><field name="subject">legislative council</field><field name="subject">legislative assembly</field><field name="subject">elections</field><field name="subject">victorian elections 1859</field><field name="subject">victorian parliament</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20080808.120248</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The comprehension strategies of above average English as a foreign language (EFL) readers</field><field name="creator">Sugirin, (Sugirin)</field><field name="description">The study reported in this thesis is a single-shot case study, which aims to provide a detailed description ofthe reading comprehension strategies used by fifteen student teachers ofEnglish from Indonesian- and Javanese-speaking backgrounds in the last year of their four-year Strata-One study at a university In Yogyakarta, Indonesia. These readers were above average among their peers in that their average indexes of grades in Reading and Speaking classes were 3.22 and 3,34 respectively, while the average indexes ofthe peer group were 271 and 2.63, respectively, out ofa scale of 0 to 400. In addition, while students in this university may complete their study by course work or by research, these readers were all enrolled as research students. As studying comprehension strategies involves complex issues, a multi-method approach is required, not only for breadth of coverage, but also to allow for a check on the validity of individual methods. To achieve the goal of the study, thinka1oud tasks, retellings, a reading comprehensIon test, indepth interviews and observations were employed to explore the strategies used.
An analysis of the recorded data indicates that these readers used thirty strategies classified under five clusters: infomiation gathering, information processing, text interpretation, comprehension monitoring, and comprehension utilisation. In general, readers started gathering information by silent reading, interpreted the text by an inference or a paraphrase, and ended the task by making selfreflections relevant to the text. Most readers managed to identify problems when they occurred, and monitored their comprehension when they doubted their interpretation, as could be seen from their rereading the text or vocalising its pail(s). When direct interpretation was difficult, readers associated the text with prior knowledge or interrelated parts of the text,
The readers in this study share characteristics of both poor and good native readers, in the sense that there was evidence ofgood strategy use butthe readers did not manage to maintain it consistently. As a result, even the successful readers were not able to maximise their potential. The implication is that in order to develop students into independent readers, strategy instruction should be part of and appropriately embedded in, the reading instruction. There is a need not merely to teach strategies as such, but rather to teach flexibility in strategy use. While there was sufficient evidence that thinkaloud tasks and their complementary methods worked to achieve the goals ofthe present study, similar studies with different cohorts are suggested for crosschecks.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">reading comprehension</field><field name="subject">foreign speakers</field><field name="subject">Bahasa Indonesia speakers</field><field name="subject">indonesia</field><field name="subject">comprehension</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20080828.092848</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A critique of "cultural fit" in relation to the recruitment of Indian Information Technologists for the Y2K project in Australia.</field><field name="creator">Booth, Judith</field><field name="description">In this study of intercultural communication, I investigate the multi-faceted meaning of the expression " cultural fit " in the sense that it is used by recruiters when shortlisting Indian information technologists to fill skills shortages for the Y2K project in Australia. The data is in the form of ten videotaped interviews in Bangalore and the recruiter commentary on those tapes in Melbourne. A crucial decision to be made by recruiters in any shortlisting process is " How will the candidate fit into the workplace?"  This question becomes more problematical when applied to overseas-trained professionals. I take a critical approach, drawing principally on the research traditions of linguistics where studies of intercultural communication and workplace interaction intersect, employing chiefly the tools of Critical Discourse Analysis and Interactional Sociolinguistics and the more abstract notions of Bourdieu. A bridge between these different discourse approaches is provided by Sarangi &amp; Roberts &lt; 1999 &lt;  who show the connection between the larger institutional order and interactional routines, through an elaboration of frontstage talk and backstage talk following Goffman &lt; 1959 &lt; .

An analysis of the interviews &lt; frontstage talk &lt; reveals "cultural fit" to involve a knowledge of institutional talk, in particular, directness. The recruiter commentary &lt; backstage talk &lt; draws attention to issues of intelligibility, body language, technical expertise and workplace values. the study shows that Indian Information Technologists have "partial fit" in that they possess technical fit but do not demonstrate, or lack the opportunity to demonstrate in the interview, Australian workplace values such as small talk, humour and informality. The recruiter judgments were fleeting and apart from checking for intelligibility, were made on the basis of candidates' body language thus highlighting its importance and its relative absence from the discourse approaches mentioned above. This study shows clearly that there is room for more communicative flexibility on the part of all the stakeholders.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Intercultural communication</field><field name="subject">cultural fit</field><field name="subject">recruiters</field><field name="subject">Indian Information Technologists</field><field name="subject">shortages</field><field name="subject">Y2K</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Bangalore</field><field name="subject">India</field><field name="subject">Melbourne</field><field name="subject">overseas-trained professionals</field><field name="subject">linguistics</field><field name="subject">Critical Discourse Analysis</field><field name="subject">frontstage talk</field><field name="subject">backstage talk</field><field name="subject">body language</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20040617.142627</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Operationalizing Queensland&#146;s Smart State policy through teachers&#146; work:
An analysis of discourses in a Central Queensland school.</field><field name="creator">Adie, Lenore Ellen</field><field name="description">The notion of Queensland as a &#145;Smart State&#146; is the Queensland Beattie Government&#146;s response to global conditions that require a new type of worker and citizen for a new knowledge economy. The role of education in the success of the &#145;Smart State&#146; is clearly outlined in the Queensland Government&#146;s vision statements and policies, identifying teachers as a key factor in the production of this new type of worker and citizen. In this study I explore the relationship between Queensland&#146;s Smart State policy and the daily practices of teachers as they are implicated in the building of a &#145;Smart State&#146;. 

The study takes place during what is unquestionably the largest and most comprehensive reform effort to be imposed on Queensland schools and teachers, under the auspices of a &#145;Smart State&#146;. The research includes policy analysis of two key Smart State documents, and fieldwork involving semi-structured interviews, observations and artefact collection of the work of two primary school teachers. Using Fairclough&#146;s theories regarding the relationship between discourse and social change, it is possible to show how changes occurring in contemporary organisations are related to changes in discourse, in particular, those surrounding the discourses of a &#145;knowledge economy&#146; or &#145;globalisation&#146;. 

The &#145;Smart State&#146; is conceptualised in this study as regimes of discourses that may produce new practices and new ways of acting and being (Fairclough, 2001a). The interdiscursive, linguistic and semiotic strategies used in Smart State policy are analysed to show how this discourse is emerging into a hegemonic position, while identifying the dominant discourses reiterated in the policy as necessary skills for a new type of worker. These discourses are mapped onto those identified through the fieldwork of teachers&#146; daily work practices to determine if Smart State discourses are becoming apparent in teachers&#146; work. 

This study is significant because it makes visible the current relationship between the discourses of the &#145;Smart State&#146; and teachers&#146; daily work. In this current climate of rapid change and economic survival it is important that the operationalization of a &#145;Smart State&#146; can be attributed to teachers&#146; work as new ways of acting and interacting become a part of their daily practices.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">policy</field><field name="subject">teachers&#146; work</field><field name="subject">Fairclough</field><field name="subject">knowledge economy</field><field name="subject">education</field><field name="subject">Queensland &#145;Smart State&#146;</field><field name="subject">hegemony</field><field name="subject">operationalization</field><field name="subject">discourse analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://library-resources.cqu.edu.au./thesis/adt-QCQU/public/adt-QCQU20070525.085011</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Relative truths regarding children&#146;s learning difficulties in a Queensland regional primary school: Adult stakeholders&#146; positions</field><field name="creator">Arizmendi, Wayne Clinton</field><field name="description">This study explored the discursive subject positions that 18 parents, teachers and administrators involved with children identified as experiencing learning difficulties in a Queensland regional primary school between September 2003 and August 2004 drew upon to explain the causes of those children&#146;s learning difficulties.

      Part one theorizes the Gothic as a subversive cultural mode that foreshadows postmodernism in terms of its antithetical relationship with Enlightenment ideals. Interconnections are made between proto-postmodern aspects of early Gothic literature and the appropriation and intensification of these aspects in what has been dubbed the postmodern Gothic. The dissertation then argues that the Antipodes was/is constructed through Euro-centric discourse(s) as a Gothic/(proto)-postmodern space or place, this construction manifest in, and becoming intertwined with the postmodern in post 1970s Antipodean cinema.
     In part two, a cross-section of Australian/New Zealand films is organized into cinematic sub-genres in line with their similar thematic preoccupations and settings, all films argued as reflecting a marked postmodern Gothic sensibility.
     In its conclusion, the study finds that &#147;Antipodean Gothic cinema&#148;, particularly since the 1970s, can be strongly characterized by its combining of Gothic/postmodernist modes of representation, this convergence constitutive of a postmodernized version of the Gothic which is heavily influenced by Euro-centric constructions of the Antipodes in Gothic/(proto)-postmodern related terms.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">gothic</field><field name="subject">Australian cinema</field><field name="subject">New Zealand cinema</field><field name="subject">postmodernism</field><field name="identifier">http://library-resources.cqu.edu.au./thesis/adt-QCQU/public/adt-QCQU20060921.111449</field></doc><doc><field name="title">THE PHYSIOLOGY OF WATER USE EFFICIENCY OF CROPS SUBJECTED TO SUBSURFACE DRIP IRRIGATION, OXYGATION AND SALINITY IN A HEAVY CLAY SOIL</field><field name="creator">BHATTARAI, SURYA PRASAD</field><field name="description">The thesis summary is included in the 01front.pdf</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Drip irrigation</field><field name="subject">oxygation</field><field name="subject">salinity</field><field name="subject">water use efficiency</field><field name="subject">physiology</field><field name="identifier">http://library-resources.cqu.edu.au./thesis/adt-QCQU/public/adt-QCQU20050903.222650</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Time Frequency Analysis of Railway Wagon Body Accelerations for a Low-Power Autonomous Device</field><field name="creator">Bleakley, Steven Shea</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the application of the techniques of Fourier spectrogram and wavelet analysis to a low power embedded microprocessor application in a novel railway and rollingstock monitoring system. 
The safe and cost effective operation of freight railways is limited by the dynamic performance of wagons running on track.  A monitoring system has been proposed comprising of low cost wireless sensing devices, dubbed &#147;Health Cards&#148;, to be installed on every wagon in the fleet.  When marshalled into a train, the devices would sense accelerations and communicate via radio network to a master system in the locomotive.  The integrated system would provide online information for decision support systems.  
Data throughput was heavily restricted by the network architecture, so significant signal analysis was required at the device level.  An electronics engineering team at Central Queensland University developed a prototype Health Card, incorporating a 27MHz microcontroller and four dual axis accelerometers.  A sensing arrangement and online analysis algorithms were required to detect and categorise dynamic events while operating within the constraints of the system. 
Time-frequency analysis reveals the time varying frequency content of signals, making it suitable to detect and characterise transient events.  With efficient algorithms such as the Fast Fourier Transform, and Fast Wavelet Transform, time-frequency analysis methods can be implemented on a low power, embedded microcontroller. 
This thesis examines the application of time-frequency analysis techniques to wagon body acceleration signals, for the purpose of detecting poor dynamic performance of the wagon-track system. The Fourier spectrogram is implemented on the Health Card prototype and demonstrated in the laboratory.  The research and algorithms provide a foundation for ongoing development as resources become available for system testing and validation.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Railway</field><field name="subject">Condition Monitoring</field><field name="subject">Vibration</field><field name="subject">Time-frequency</field><field name="subject">Spectrogram</field><field name="subject">Wavelet</field><field name="identifier">http://library-resources.cqu.edu.au./thesis/adt-QCQU/public/adt-QCQU20070622.121515</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Exploration of Learning Environments used by students in a first year University course</field><field name="creator">Carpenter, Donna Lyn</field><field name="description">This research involved the design, development and implementation of an online survey instrument to identify the physical learning environments and resources students use when studying an online course. It was found, through a review of the literature, that there was no appropriate instrument available for this purpose. It was also found that the term physical learning environment actually is not well defined in the literature. These two factors have been addressed in this research.
The results obtained from the survey found that students used a mixture of physical learning resources such as textbooks, and online resources such as email and online submission of assessment items. However, none of these resources were used all the time. It was also established that the majority of students preferred to learn at home using either online or paper-based resource material. The results also showed that the library both as a resource and as a learning environment was not being used to its full potential.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Education</field><field name="subject">Learning environments</field><field name="subject">ICTs</field><field name="identifier">http://library-resources.cqu.edu.au./thesis/adt-QCQU/public/adt-QCQU20070524.132217</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Towards a Reinterpretation of the Radical Theory of Associative Rings Using Base Radical and Base Semisimple Class Constructions</field><field name="creator">Chin, Melanie Soo</field><field name="description">This research aims to refresh and reinterpret the radical theory of associative rings using the base radical and base semisimple class constructions.  It also endeavours to generalise some results about ideals of rings in terms of accessible subrings.  A characterisation of accessible subrings is included.  By applying the base radical and base semisimple class constructions to many of the known results in established radical theory a number of gaps are uncovered and closed, with the goal of making the theory more accessible to advanced undergraduate and graduate students and mathematicians in related fields, and to open up new areas of investigation.  
    After a literature review and brief reminder of algebra rudiments, the useful properties of accessible subrings and the U and S operators independent from radical class connections are described.  The section on accessible subrings illustrates that replacing ideals with accessible subrings is indeed possible for a number of results and demonstrates its usefulness.  
    The traditional radical and semisimple class definitions are included and it is shown that the base radical and base semisimple class constructions are equivalent.  Diagrams illustrating the constructions support the definitions.  From then on, all radical and semisimple classes mentioned are understood to have the base radical and base semisimple class form.  Subject to the constraints of this work, many known results of traditional radical theory are reinterpreted with new proofs, illustrating the potential to simplify the understanding of radical theory using the base radical and base semisimple class constructions. Along with reinterpreting known results, new results emerge giving further insight to radical theory and its intricacies.  Accessible subrings and the U and S operators are integrated into the development.  The duality between the base radical and base semisimple class constructions is demonstrated in earnest.  
    With a measure of the theory presented, the new constructions are applied to examples and concrete radicals.  Context is supported by establishing the relationship between some well-known rings and the radical and related classes of interest.  
    The title of the thesis, Towards a Reinterpretation of the Radical Theory of Associative Rings Using Base Radical and Base Semisimple Class Constructions, reflects the understanding that reinterpreting the entirety of radical theory is beyond the scope of this work. The conclusion includes an outlook listing further research that time did not allow.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">mathematics</field><field name="subject">radical</field><field name="subject">radical theory</field><field name="subject">ring</field><field name="subject">ring theory</field><field name="subject">associative rings</field><field name="subject">base radical</field><field name="subject">base semisimple</field><field name="subject">accessible subrings</field><field name="identifier">http://library-resources.cqu.edu.au./thesis/adt-QCQU/public/adt-QCQU20050411.102928</field></doc><doc><field name="title">SUSTAINABILITY PERFORMANCE EVALUATION MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS MODEL FOR INDIVIDUAL ORGANIZATIONS AND SUPPLY CHAINS</field><field name="creator">Coelho, Jose Flavio Guerra Machado</field><field name="description">The title of the research is Sustainability Performance Evaluation Management Systems Model for Individual Organizations and Supply Chains.  This research has achieved its aim to develop and demonstrate the practical implementation of a simple and objective sustainability performance evaluation management system model for individual organizations and supply chains. It has resulted in the recognition that a new concept &#150; Network of Interested Partners &#150; underpins the achievement of sustainability.  The term acknowledges the interdependence and reflects the essential cooperation that must be achieved between business organisations, their commercially related entities and the local community if progress towards sustainability is to be achieved. It therefore encompasses and extends the concept of a supply chain as currently used.

Sustainable Development is defined by the World Commission on Environment and Development as development, which meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future societies to meet their own needs. Organizations, as part of human activities, also have to be sustainable. The sustainability of organizations is directly linked to the continual improvement of business performance.  Many organizations have found a way to improve performance through the establishment of management systems. International Organization for Standardization (ISO) standards are recognized worldwide as reliable and efficient tools for the implementation of management systems. However, they do not always result in the desired improvement in outcomes.  Therefore, if the required improvement of business performance is to be achieved, improved methodologies for development and implementation of performance evaluation (PE) processes are necessary.  These methodologies must take into consideration sustainability principles.  They also have to be applicable to individual entities and supply chains, with or without management systems in place.  Supply chains are important because it is being increasingly recognized that overall supply chain performance is a means of adding value and competitive advantage to all businesses. 

In the first part of the research a performance evaluation model or PE (version 1 model) was developed. This was used as criteria to compare and evaluate existing performance evaluation processes and outcomes of individual organisations and their respective supply chain within the Gladstone region, Australia. Questionnaires have also been used to identify and evaluate the needs of the interested parties in relation to the organizations&#146; and supply chains&#146; business performance and processes of performance evaluation. 

All the information provided in the first part of the research was used by the researcher to develop the Sustainability Performance Evaluation Management Systems model or SPEMS (version 2 model). This incorporates the concepts of Network of Interested Parties/Partners. In particular, one of the outcomes is recognition that organizations need to establish partnerships if effective supply chain performance improvement is to be achieved. Therefore the establishment of partnerships has become a key requirement for the implementation of SPEMS.

The establishment of partnership among participants of a supply chain of Gladstone and implementation of the eight first steps of the SPEMS (version 2 model) in this supply chain was commenced successfully through workshops. The supply chain was formed by commercial organizations, government entities and interested parties from the community. SPEMS requires that partners all have the same level of ownership and authority in the decisions of the supply chain.

Some new terms and their definitions have been created within the research to support the new SPEMS model. They include: Network of Interested Partners, sustainability for organizations, sustainability KPI and sustainability friendly organizations.

All of the above are encompassed within the final SPEMS (version 3 model).</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ISO</field><field name="subject">Performance evaluation</field><field name="subject">Business metrics</field><field name="subject">Management systems</field><field name="subject">Decision making</field><field name="subject">Triple bottom line report: Knowledge management</field><field name="subject">Balanced scorecard</field><field name="subject">Social responsibility</field><field name="subject">Accountability: Business ethics</field><field name="subject">Social</field><field name="subject">Environmental</field><field name="subject">Economic</field><field name="subject">CSR</field><field name="subject">Performance indicators</field><field name="subject">Quality</field><field name="subject">Health and safety</field><field name="subject">Partnership</field><field name="subject">Community participation</field><field name="subject">Community consultation</field><field name="subject">Sustainable indicators</field><field name="subject">Eco efficiency</field><field name="subject">Organizational culture</field><field name="subject">Sustainability</field><field name="subject">Cleaner production</field><field name="subject">Continual improvement</field><field name="subject">Supply chain</field><field name="subject">SPEMS</field><field name="subject">NIP</field><field name="subject">Communication</field><field name="identifier">http://library-resources.cqu.edu.au./thesis/adt-QCQU/public/adt-QCQU20060720.094327</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Positive Psychological Perspective of the Direct and Indirect Influences of Gender Role Schema and the Experience of Childhood Trauma on Psychological, Physical, and Social Well-Being in Adulthood</field><field name="creator">Coker, Suzanne Patricia</field><field name="description">This research assessed psychosocial and cognitive factors influencing well-being, utilising a positive psychological perspective.  The theoretical framework of this research was provided by two of the sub-theories of Self-Determination Theory &#150; Basic Needs Theory and Organismic Integration Theory &#150; along with Gender Role Theory, and Beck&#146;s Cognitive Triad, with each of these theories relating differentially to the concept of control or self-determination.  More specifically, the current research examined the relationship between gender role schema and the experience of childhood trauma with psychological, physical, and social well-being in adults.  Two studies were conducted.  Study 1 employed a random sample of 410 participants from Central Queensland, Australia, to develop the World Beliefs Inventory (WBI).  This 21-item inventory was developed to assess world beliefs, based on a translation of Aerts et al.&#146;s (1994) philosophical conceptualisation of world beliefs into common terminology.  Developing the WBI enabled the assessment of world beliefs, which along with beliefs about oneself (operationalised as perceived control), and the future (dispositional optimism) constitute Beck&#146;s (1976) cognitive triad.  Statistical analyses indicated that the inventory provided a good representation of the world beliefs construct, as well as possessing favourable concurrent validity (e.g., positive views regarding the nature of the world were associated with decreased frequency of depressive symptoms experienced, and greater general psychological health and self-esteem).  Study 2 was designed to investigate the direct and indirect relationships between gender role schema (masculinity and femininity) and the experience of childhood trauma with psychological, physical, and social well-being, being mediated by (a) the satisfaction of the basic psychological needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness, (b) beliefs about the world, oneself, and the future, (c) the self-regulation of withholding negative emotion (SRWNE), and (d) somatic amplification.  Study 2 employed a separate random sample of 605 participants from Central Queensland.  Psychological, physical, and social well-being were each assessed independently to determine whether patterns of significant relationships were similar or different across the different types of well-being.  In order to test the theories underlying the structural models of well-being, five hierarchical models of each type of well-being were analysed and compared.  Satisfaction of the basic psychological needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness, and beliefs about the future (dispositional optimism) were found to play a role in the process via which masculinity, femininity, and the experience of childhood trauma influenced all three forms of well-being, while world beliefs were additionally found to influence social well-being, and the SRWNE additionally influenced physical well-being.  Results therefore support Basic Needs Theory and provide partial support for Beck&#146;s cognitive triad.  They also provide evidence of the utility of the concept of the SRWNE, which was developed in accordance with Organismic Integration Theory.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Gender Role Schema</field><field name="subject">childhood trauma</field><field name="subject">psychological needs</field><field name="subject">beliefs about the world oneself and the future</field><field name="subject">the self regulation of the withholding of negative emotions</field><field name="subject">somatic amplification</field><field name="subject">psychological physical and social well-being</field><field name="subject">Structural Equation Modelling</field><field name="identifier">http://library-resources.cqu.edu.au./thesis/adt-QCQU/public/adt-QCQU20071016.145424</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mount Morgan: images and realitiesdynamics
and decline of a mining town</field><field name="creator">Cosgrove, Betty Alveen</field><field name="description">Most histories and reports of Mount Morgan concentrate on the mining experience and financial achievements of the first Company rather than the mining town. This dissertation presents a social history of Mount Morgan that addresses the establishment, rise and fall of the town during the period of the first syndicate and succeeding company, 1883-1927. The thesis contends that the transformation of the landscape was to industrial, urban space where the working-class attitudes of miners and others defined a town character, despite the aspiration of many to social status through private enterprise and public influence. Further, the scope of research encompassed local involvement in colonial and state politics, and the presence of local government authority, law courts and press that placed an urban stamp on the town. Issues discussed also relate to geographic, climatic and single company influences that caused the difference between Mount Morgan and other mining towns that did not survive. The traditional perception of mining town impermanence was contradicted at Mount Morgan, where town and suburban communities were witness to a range of collective support in religious adherence, benefit associations, fraternalism and ritual, leisure, sport, education, and social cohesion in times of mining disaster. Moreover, despite
increasing familial connections, antagonistic attitudes prevailed between the defensively parochial town of Mount Morgan and the nearby regional centre of Rockhampton.

The rise of unionism at Mount Morgan challenged an apathetic working-class population to workplace solidarity in reaction to the Company's long established, almost feudal control of the town as well as the mine. It is argued that, despite a decade of
failing ore markets and soaring production costs at the mine, the attitudes and actions of a union dominated workforce were paramount in decline of the town and ultimate closure of the mine. Mount Morgan survived the exodus of thousands of residents. A defiant place, the town exhibited a pride bolstered by the perpetuation of myths that presented a public image shielded from the life-long realities of economic and social adversity.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mount Morgan</field><field name="subject">mining</field><field name="subject">mine closure</field><field name="subject">unionism</field><field name="subject">social structure</field><field name="subject">mining town</field><field name="identifier">http://library-resources.cqu.edu.au./thesis/adt-QCQU/public/adt-QCQU20050427.131849</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Learning on the Run:
Traveller Education for
Itinerant Show Children
in Coastal and Western Queensland</field><field name="creator">Danaher, Patrick Alan</field><field name="description">&#147;Learning on the Run&#148; refers to the educational experiences of the primary
school children travelling along the agricultural show &#145;circuits&#146; in coastal and
western Queensland. This thesis examines those educational experiences by
drawing on the voices of the show children, their parents, their home tutors
and their teachers from the Brisbane School of Distance Education, which
from 1989 to 1999 implemented a specialised program of Traveller education
for these children (in 2000 a separate school was established for them).
The thesis focusses on the interplay among marginalisation, resistance
and transformation in the spaces of the show people&#146;s itinerancy. It deploys
Michel de Certeau&#146;s (1984, 1986) concept of &#145;tactics of consumption&#146; and
Mikhail Bakhtin&#146;s (1986a) notions of &#145;outsiddness&#146; and &#145;creative understanding&#146;
to interrogate the show people&#146;s engagement with their absence of
place, the construction of their otherness and forms of seemingly
unproblematic knowledge about their schooling. Data gathering techniques
included semi-structured interviews with forty-two people between 1992 and
2000 in seven sites in Queensland - Mackay, Bundaberg (over two years),
Emerald, Brisbane, Rockhampton and Yeppoon - and document collection.
The thesis&#146;s major finding is that the show people&#146;s resistance and
transformation of their marginalising experiences have enabled them to initiate
and implement a significant counternarrative to the traditional narrative (and
associated stereotypes) attending their itinerancy. This counternarrative has
underpinned a fundamental change in their schooling provision, from a
structure that worked to marginalise and disempower them to a specialised
form of Traveller education. This change contributes crucially to understanding
and theorising the spaces of itinerancy, and highlights the broader
significance of the Queensland show people&#146;s &#147;learning on the run&#148;.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Mikhail Bakhtin</field><field name="subject">Michel de Certeau</field><field name="subject">marginalisation</field><field name="subject">resistance</field><field name="subject">show people</field><field name="subject">transformation</field><field name="subject">Traveller education</field><field name="identifier">http://library-resources.cqu.edu.au./thesis/adt-QCQU/public/adt-QCQU20060830.110820</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Pulmonary Oxygen Uptake and Muscle Oxygenation Responses to Exercise in Well-Trained Young and Middle-Aged Cyclists</field><field name="creator">Dascombe, Benjamin James</field><field name="description">This thesis details four consecutive research investigations which were designed to examine the effect of age on the pulmonary oxygen uptake (VO2)and muscle oxygenation (mOxy) responses to exercise in well-trained cyclists.

Typically,
these women have been away from study for a number of years and, in order to gain
entrance into a university course most women are required to undertake a bridging
program. Bridging programs can provide women with an alternative pathway into
university and are designed to develop the academic and study skills required to
successfully undertake undergraduate studies. The Women into Science and Technology
(WIST) bridging program, offered by Central Queensland University, is a self-paced
bridging program which provides a low cost, study at home option specifically designed
to accommodate women&#146;s needs.
This research focuses on the perceived needs of women who are enrolled in the WIST
program. To this end a survey instrument has been developed to identify the needs and
challenges of women undertaking the WIST program. This instrument was used to
explore the needs and challenges of women enrolled in the WIST program.
The survey results revealed that women have a range of needs which include support
from the university, development of study and academic skills, personal qualities such
as motivation and determination as well as support from their family and personal
networks. The results indicate that the university needs to provide a range of support
mechanisms and processes. These outcomes were used to develop the Get SET for Study
framework that can be used for the planning and design of bridging courses similar to
WIST for women who are considering enrolling in university.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">continuing education</field><field name="subject">higher education</field><field name="subject">learning communities</field><field name="subject">communities of practice</field><field name="subject">student support</field><field name="subject">bridging courses</field><field name="subject">women</field><field name="subject">enabling</field><field name="subject">multiple roles</field><field name="subject">adult learners</field><field name="subject">adult education</field><field name="subject">re-entry students</field><field name="subject">first-year students</field><field name="identifier">http://library-resources.cqu.edu.au./thesis/adt-QCQU/public/adt-QCQU20080717.093639</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A shock in time saves lives: Theory of Planned Behaviour and nurse-initiated defibrillation</field><field name="creator">Dwyer, Trudy</field><field name="description">The time from onset of a cardiac arrest to defibrillation is crucial hence access to and use of a defibrillator by all nurses essential. The purpose of this study was to use an established theoretical framework to examine and describe the defibrillation practices and beliefs of rural registered nurses in the Australian state of Queensland. The Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA) and Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) guided the research processes for this two phase study. In the first phase, focus group (n = 13) discussions identified the salient beliefs of the population. By eliciting nurses' beliefs, the subsequent quantitative study (n = 434) was conducted to determine the influences of these beliefs on nurses' use or non-use of defibrillators. The results showed that: (1) less than half of the cohort of participants were permitted to defibrillate; (2) the defibrillation beliefs of those nurses permitted to defibrillate were significantly more positive than those not permitted to do so; (3) the direct measures of TPB and selected variables external to the model predicted a significant portion of the variance in the measure of nurse-initiated defibrillation intention; and, (4) subjective norm emerged as the strongest predictor of intention. In conclusion, Queensland rural hospital nurses and employers still have some distance to travel down the path of nurse-initiated defibrillation. The TPB is a viable framework on which to base interventions designed to promote defibrillation by rural nurses. Understanding the role of social norms is of central importance to ensure all nurses can initiate the chain of survival expeditiously whenever the need arises.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">defibrillation</field><field name="subject">Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA)</field><field name="subject">Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB)</field><field name="subject">nurse-initiated defibrillation</field><field name="identifier">http://library-resources.cqu.edu.au./thesis/adt-QCQU/public/adt-QCQU20050221.152259</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Using Formal Health Education Sessions to Increase
Mammography use among women of Non-English Speaking Backgrounds in Rockhampton</field><field name="creator">Ferdous, Tabassum</field><field name="description">Although there has been an increasing incidence of breast cancer among Non-English
speaking background (NESB) women in many developed countries, existing screening
services are being underused by these women. Studies show that the barriers to the
accessibility of breast cancer screening by NESB women include their lack of awareness, low
level of education, low self-efficacy and lack of social interaction with other women. This
study aimed to investigate the knowledge relating to breast cancer and mammography, self-efficacy
and barriers to mammography use among NESB women in an Australian regional
city before and after their attendance at a health education session. This health education
session aimed to increase the awareness and use of mammography among these NESB
women. Two widely used behaviour theories, &#145;Health belief model&#146; and &#145;Social Cognitive
Theory,&#146; were applied as the theoretical framework for this study.
A quasi-experimental study was conducted in which the health education session was
used as an intervention. Pre-test and post-test questionnaires were completed by study
participants before and after the health education session. Their knowledge of breast cancer
and mammography was assessed. In addition, their self-efficacy and barriers to the use of
mammography were also analysed.
Results indicated that informal recruitment strategies were more effective with these
NESB women. Initially 49 women were recruited. Of these, 23 women (47%) attended the
health education session. As data showed tertiary educated and employed women who already
had mammogram/s were more likely to attend the session. After attending the health education
session, the women&#146;s knowledge relating to breast cancer and mammography was improved
and the perceived barriers to the use of mammography were reduced. During a three month
follow-up period, there was no change of mammogram use by the women. However, the
results showed a trend of increased intention to use the mammogram over a period of two
years (41.7%) compared to six months (25.0%). Based on these results, further studies are
recommended to explore the beneficial outcomes of health promotion programs targeting
NESB women who are not in the workforce or have a low level of education.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">non-english speaking background</field><field name="subject">women</field><field name="subject">breast screening</field><field name="subject">mammography</field><field name="identifier">http://library-resources.cqu.edu.au./thesis/adt-QCQU/public/adt-QCQU20070718.142605</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Staff Perceptions of an
Enterprise Resource Planning
System Implementation: A Case
Study of three Australian
Universities</field><field name="creator">Fisher, Marilyn Dale</field><field name="description">This study examines staff perceptions of the implementation of an Enterprise
Resource Planning system (ERPs) in three Australian universities. It considers the
growing body of literature on the issues impacting on effective and efficacious
Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) implementations in organisations including the
most recent literature on ERPs in the higher education sector. This literature
identifies a number of issues that it is argued, translates from the corporate sector to
the higher education sector including a number that require additional focus in this
sector. It is proposed in this dissertation that effective and efficacious
implementations in Australian universities require particular consideration of
organisational influences related to their context and the perceptions of the users of
the systems.
Case study methodology was used to examine the staff perceptions of the
management of ERP implementations in universities. This involved undertaking
case studies in three Australian universities in the process of implementing ERP
systems. The first phase of the study obtained data through a series of focus groups
at one university to explore staff perceptions of the efficacy of the ERP
implementation at their university. This data and the relevant literature served as a
framework for the development of the research process in the second phase of the
study. This phase involved conducting a series of interviews with staff that enabled
the researcher to undertake a more detailed exploration of the staff perceptions of
influences affecting ERP system implementations at three Australian universities.
The research study identifies the influences impacting on the outcomes of these
implementations of ERPs in the three Australian universities and forms the basis for
the development of guidelines for the effective and efficacious management of ERP

This thesis aims at providing better insight into the behaviour of WSRM walls subjected to inplane lateral loading through experimental and numerical investigations. 
The interactions between the unreinforced masonry (URM) panels and vertical reinforced cores are first determined using an elastic finite element analysis and the potential failure paths hypothesized.  The hypotheses are then validated using a series of full-scale WSRM and Non-WSRM wall tests under monotonic and cyclic lateral loading by keeping the spacing between the vertical reinforced cores as the main design variable.  Load-displacement response of these shear walls indicates that the current classification of the WSRM in AS3700 (2001) as those walls containing vertical reinforced grouted cores at 2000mm maximum spacing is appropriate.  
A finite element model (FEM) based on an explicit solution algorithm is developed for predicting the response of the masonry shear walls tested under static loading. The FEM has adopted macroscopic masonry failure criteria and flow rules, damaged plasticity model for grout and tension-only model for reinforcing bars reported in the literature, and predicted crack opening and post-peak load behaviour of the shear walls.  By minimising the kinetic energy using appropriate time scaling, the FEM has provided reasonable and efficient prediction of load flow, crack patterns and load&#150;displacement curves of the shear walls.  The FEM is further validated using full-scale tests on WSRM walls of aspect ratios and pre-compression different to that tested before. 
The validated FEM is used to examine the appropriateness of the prescriptive design details for WSRM concrete masonry shear walls provided in AS3700 (2001) allowing for a large scatter in material properties.  It is shown that the inplane shear capacity formula provided in AS3700 (2001) for squat WSRM shear walls is non-conservative.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">masonry walls</field><field name="subject">shear loading</field><field name="subject">FEM</field><field name="identifier">http://library-resources.cqu.edu.au./thesis/adt-QCQU/public/adt-QCQU20070421.130337</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Robust Control for Offshore Steel Jacket Platforms under Wave-Induced Forces</field><field name="creator">Dongsheng, Han</field><field name="description">This thesis is concerned with robust control of an offshore steel jacket platform
subject to nonlinear wave-induced forces. Since time delay and uncertainty are
inevitably encountered for an offshore structure and their existence may induce instability, oscillation and poor performance, it is very significant to study on how the
delay and uncertainty affect the offshore structure. In this thesis, a memory robust
control strategy is, for the first time, proposed to reduce the internal oscillations
of the offshore structure under wave-induced forces, so as to ensure the safety and
comfort of the offshore structure.
Firstly, when the system's states are adopted as feedback, memory state feedback
controllers are introduced for the offshore structure. By using Lyapunov-Krasovskii
stability theory, some delay-dependent stability criteria have been established, based
on which, and by combining with some linearization techniques, memory state feedback controllers are designed to control the offshore structure. The simulation results show that such controllers can effectively reduce the internal oscillations of the
offshore structure subject to nonlinear wave-induced forces and uncertainties. On
the other hand, a new Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional is introduced to derive a less
conservative delay-dependent stability criterion. When this criterion is applied to
the offshore structure, an improved memory state feedback controller with a small
gain is obtained to control the system more effectively, which is sufficiently shown
by the simulation.
Secondly, when the system's outputs are adopted as feedback, memory dynamic
output feedback controllers are considered for the offshore structure. By employing
a projection theorem and a cone complementary linearization approach, memory
dynamic output feedback controllers are derived by solving some nonlinear minimization problem subject to some linear matrix inequalities. The simulation results
show that the internal oscillations of the offshore structure subject to nonlinear
wave-induced forces are well attenuated.
Finally, robust H control is fully investigated for the offshore structure. By employing Lyapunov-Krasovskii stability theory, some delay-dependent bounded real
lemmas have been obtained, under which, via a memory state feedback controller or
a dynamic output feedback controller, the resulting closed-loop system is not only
asymptotically stable but also with a prescribed disturbance attenuation level. The
simulation results illustrate the validity of the proposed method.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">offshore structures</field><field name="subject">time-delay</field><field name="subject">state feedback control</field><field name="subject">dynamic output feedback</field><field name="identifier">http://library-resources.cqu.edu.au./thesis/adt-QCQU/public/adt-QCQU20080717.104813</field></doc><doc><field name="title">INVESTIGATION OF THE DYNAMICS OF RAILWAY BOGIES SUBJECTED TO TRACTION / BRAKING TORQUE</field><field name="creator">Handoko, Yunendar Aryo</field><field name="description">The limitations of current simulation packages in addressing the true longitudinal behaviour of railway bogie dynamics during braking/traction has prompted the development of a Rail Bogie Dynamics (RBD) program in this thesis. The RBD program offers novel features for the calculation of the speed profile as a function of the brake torque as well as explicitly determining wheelset angular velocity. With such capability, the speed profile is no longer treated as an input calculated as a priori as required by most of the current simulation systems. The RBD program has been developed using a formulation that includes the wheelset pitch degree of freedom explicitly with a coordinate reference system that is fixed in space and time. The formulation has made the simulation of the bogie dynamics during braking/traction possible in a natural way using the brake/traction torque as the input and the resulting speed profile as the output without any need for working out the speed profile as a priori. Consequently, severe dynamics during braking such as the wheelset skid and the onset of wheel climb derailment can be modelled and critical parameters investigated using the RBD program. The RBD program has been validated, where possible, through a series of simulations using a commercial software package (VAMPIRE). For cases which cannot be simulated by VAMPIRE such as the wheelset skid, a novel experimental program has been designed and commissioned in the Heavy Testing Laboratory of the Central Queensland University as reported in this thesis. One of the possible applications of the RBD program in examining the effect of asymmetric brake shoe force in bogies equipped with one-side push brake shoe arrangement is illustrated in this thesis. It is believed that the model and RBD program will have significant benefit in understanding the true longitudinal behaviour of wagons in suburban passenger trains that operate under braking/ traction torques for most of their travel. Similar studies will also be useful to freight train wagon dynamics during entry and exit of speed restriction zones and tight curves.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">railway</field><field name="subject">bogies</field><field name="subject">longitudinal dynamics</field><field name="subject">simulation</field><field name="subject">asymmetric braking</field><field name="subject">traction torque</field><field name="subject">wheelset skid</field><field name="identifier">http://library-resources.cqu.edu.au./thesis/adt-QCQU/public/adt-QCQU20070209.101959</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Brokering Changes: A study of power and identity through discourses</field><field name="creator">Harreveld, Roberta Elizabeth</field><field name="description">Brokering Changes refers to the ways in which teachers broker their compliance with a new literacy knowledge base for adults. This thesis reports a study of twenty-three members of a cohort of adult literacy teachers working in regional, rural and remote communities throughout Central Queensland from 1996 to 2001. It details the performance and recognition work that these teachers did as they negotiated their way through a large curriculum reform as literacy was redefined from something that was negotiated as useful for the learner to something that is named and mandated by the state. 

The theoretical framework engages with interrelated notions of power, discourse and identity with supporting conceptualisations of ideology, work and pedagogy in the production and exercise of disciplinary power as understood through the thinking of Michel Foucault (1984). The methodological approach deploys James Gee&#146;s (1991, 1992, 1993, 1996a, 1996b, 1997, 1999) particular socio-cultural theory of D/discourse. Spoken, written and observed data are analysed using Gee&#146;s (1993, 1999) interrelated linguistic system&#146;s analysis method. 

The major finding is that these teachers actively broker the effects of these changes through their professional practices. This study is an important contribution to the literature concerning the professional lives of teachers of adults in an era of fast capital and performance-based government. Significantly, the research provides important insights into the problems faced by teachers who are confronted with the implementation of major curriculum reforms while living far removed from the networks and activities of the system in which they worked.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">brokering changes</field><field name="subject">discourses</field><field name="subject">identity</field><field name="subject">work</field><field name="subject">power</field><field name="subject">adult literacy teaching</field><field name="subject">vocational education and training</field><field name="identifier">http://library-resources.cqu.edu.au./thesis/adt-QCQU/public/adt-QCQU20040323.163833</field></doc><doc><field name="title">John Douglas 1828-1904: The
Uncompromising Liberal</field><field name="creator">Hodes, Jeremy Martin</field><field name="description">Douglas was born in London in 1828 and migrated to New South Wales in 1851 where he represented both the Darling Downs and Camden districts in the New South Wales parliament before
embarking on a lengthy parliamentary career in Queensland, one that culminated in the premiership from 1877 to 1879. He was
subsequently appointed government resident for Thursday Island in 1885, a position he held until his death, nearly 20 years later, aged
76, in 1904. During this period he also served as special commissioner for the protectorate of British New Guinea, administering the territory prior to it being formally proclaimed a
crown colony.

Douglas&#146;s involvement in Queensland public life was significant and encompassed the entire period from the colony&#146;s formation in 1859 to
the federation of the Australian colonies in 1901. In this respect, his career allows, through a study of his long, eventful and varied life, for
this thesis to examine aspects of the development and progression of Queensland&#146;s political system as a nascent yet robust, representative
democracy, through most of the second half of the nineteenth century until the colony&#146;s incorporation in the newly formed
Commonwealth of Australia.

This thesis argues that John Douglas was an uncompromising Liberal in an age of Liberalism, a principled politician in an era of pragmatic factionalism and shifting political allegiances. Perhapsbecause of this he was more popular with his electorate than with his parliamentary colleagues.

Douglas&#146;s contribution to Queensland life was in large measure shaped by his character and the formative influences on it. This included his aristocratic upbringing, his public school and university education, his abiding religious faith, a profound sense of fair play, and a desire to participate fully and selflessly in the life of the community he lived in, despite the vicissitudes of his personal life.

As this thesis further demonstrates, an examination of Douglas&#146;s life affords us an insight into an energetic, accomplished, erudite, and compassionate man. Yet while his intellectual curiosity, thirst for knowledge and wide-ranging interests marked him as a Renaissance man, he also had many failings, most noticeably that of extreme obstinacy. Therefore, this thesis will analyse Douglas&#146;s convictions and beliefs while examining the strengths and flaws inherent in his
character. It is because Douglas lived a life characterised by complexity and contradiction, leavened by a mixture of accomplishment and failure, that his life, and the times he lived in,
are worthy of examination.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">History</field><field name="subject">Queensland</field><field name="subject">politics</field><field name="subject">biography</field><field name="subject">Torres Strait</field><field name="subject">New Guinea</field><field name="identifier">http://library-resources.cqu.edu.au./thesis/adt-QCQU/public/adt-QCQU20070228.145456</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Application of tree and stand allometrics to the
determination of biomass and its flux in some
north-east Australian woodlands.</field><field name="creator">Hoffmann, Madonna Bridget</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the effects of species, rainfall and soil type on tree biomass
regressions, as well as the effects of stand dominance and structure on stand biomass
regressions in north-east Australian woodlands. This was achieved by examining tree
characteristics and biomass relationships for a series of woodland monitoring sites
throughout the study area. This study utilised a modified data set from this permanent
monitoring site network to provide structural attributes for trees and communities of
varying composition in the grazed woodlands. These data were supplemented with
environmental data and tree harvest data sets.
Initially, the research reported in this thesis developed allometric and stand biomass
regressions for Callitris glaucophylla communities. This research also demonstrated
that changes in tree-form were not reflected in changes in the environment, nor did
such changes reflect changes in tree biomass regressions for three eucalypt species.
As a result, a common regression provides a robust estimate of total aboveground
biomass of eucalypt trees in the study area. Thus expensive destructive harvesting
can generally be avoided for minor eucalypt species. Finally, this study demonstrated
a successful methodology that described the stand structure of all the grazed
woodland sites based on tree heights. This methodology was developed to allow the
expansion of a single stand regression to estimate stand biomass across the entire
north-east Australian woodlands.
The findings demonstrated in this study, combined with the long-term data from the
permanent monitoring network sites, should enhance the estimation of carbon flux
within eucalypt communities of north-east Australia&#146;s grazed woodlands.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">allometrics</field><field name="subject">eucalypts</field><field name="subject">biomass</field><field name="subject">northern Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://library-resources.cqu.edu.au./thesis/adt-QCQU/public/adt-QCQU20070525.144254</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Beginning Teachers' Conceptions of Competence</field><field name="creator">Huntly, Helen Eva</field><field name="description">The focus of this study is the phenomenon of beginning teacher competence. In Queensland, the context for the research presented here, the competence of beginning teachers is appraised by their supervisor (usually the principal) at the end of their first year of full-time employment. This appraisal is conducted on behalf of the Queensland Board of Teacher Registration and a positive outcome enables beginning teachers to achieve full teacher registration. Although there exists research suggesting that principals bring to the appraisal process their conceptions of competence, there is a dearth of knowledge about beginning teachers' conceptions of their own teaching competence. The research presented here adds to the debate about competence by including the voice of the beginning teacher. This focus, located within the context of local issues, is used to explore important themes that are relevant to other systems of beginning teacher appraisal.

The selection of phenomenography as the research approach adopted for this study is based on its appropriateness to the investigation of a phenomenon such as competence.  Phenomenography aims to describe, analyse and understand the ways in which people experience aspects of the world around them. The point of departure that sets apart this approach from many others, is the principle that phenomenography seeks to investigate neither the phenomenon, nor the people who experience the phenomenon, but the relation between the two. The results of a phenomenographic study are presented as a description of all of the possible conceptions that a specific group can have about a particular phenomenon.

For the research presented here, eighteen beginning teachers were interviewed individually in order to identify and describe the variation in their conceptions of competence. Research participants representing State, Catholic and Independent school systems were drawn from preschools, special, primary and secondary schools of one provincial city, in one regional area of South East Queensland.

Two major outcomes emerged from the research presented here. Firstly, beginning teachers were identified as experiencing competence in a number of ways.  Although these conceptions were varied, their number was quite limited. Six distinct conceptions of beginning teacher competence were identified, with a further finding that individual beginning teachers were not limited to one conception, but conceived of competence in multiple ways.

Because the relational nature of competence demands that it be investigated within the context in which it is experienced, this study also identified five different approaches to competence appraisal, as understood by the beginning teachers who had undergone the appraisal process. Comparisons of both conceptions of competence and approaches to appraisal were then compared to existing research in this area.

This thesis presents an alternative view of competence and appraisal that may be used to further develop the process of appraisal and indeed, the professional development of beginning teachers.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Beginning teachers; First year teachers; Novice teachers; Probationary period; Provisional registration; Competence; Appraisal of beginning teachers; Phenomenography; Qualitative research</field><field name="identifier">http://library-resources.cqu.edu.au./thesis/adt-QCQU/public/adt-QCQU20050512.134448</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Exploration of Strategy Processes and Stakeholder Involvement in Implementation in Queensland Regional Economic Development Organisations.</field><field name="creator">Hutchinson, Tanya Jane</field><field name="description">Strategy offers regional stakeholders an opportunity to collaboratively influence the future direction of their region&#146;s economy.  However, limited research has been undertaken with respect to strategy processes that are being used by regional economic development organisations.  While there are suggestions for the ideal content of regional economic development strategies, the processes by which these organisations develop and implement strategy have not been investigated.  This thesis documents an exploratory research project that utilises a case study methodology to identify and consider the processes applied in three different regional economic development organisations.
In order to appreciate the context of regional strategy development, theory on regions, collaboration and strategy is integrated to develop a detailed theoretical framework of twenty seven elements that are thought to contribute to implementation.  The presence or absence of these elements in each of the three cases is explored deductively through a review of internal documents and semi-structured interviews with a mix of regional stakeholders.  Elements are investigated within cases to understand how strategy is being applied within each particular context.  Analysis across cases is documented, identifying both similarities and differences in the presence and absence of elements.
The research found that relationships were important to the continuing future of the organisations.  Long term planning was absent in all cases and this absence was attributed to contextual factors such as a dynamic external environment, and a dependence on government funding leading to short term planning cycles.  There was also a lack of clarity regarding organisational goals.  The processes utilised in all cases most closely matched Mintzberg and Waters&#146; (1998) umbrella strategy, however, all organisations lacked a strategic approach.
A tentative model was developed to depict elements thought to be the most significant to collaborative regional strategy implementation.  These elements are: leadership on strategic planning; good member to member relationships; realism; long term goals; performance measures tied to long term goals; ongoing review and updating of the strategic plan; relevance of the strategic plan; and consistency of activities with the strategic plan.  The need for further research to investigate these potential relationships was indicated.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">strategy</field><field name="subject">economic development</field><field name="subject">regional development</field><field name="subject">strategic planning</field><field name="identifier">http://library-resources.cqu.edu.au./thesis/adt-QCQU/public/adt-QCQU20070209.143523</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Teacher conceptions of student engagement in learning:A phenomenographic investigation</field><field name="creator">Irvin, Lois Ruth</field><field name="description">This study utilises a phenomenographic approach to investigate teacher conceptions
of student engagement in learning. The research question asks: &#147;What are the
qualitatively different conceptions of student engagement in learning held by
secondary English teachers in Central Queensland?&#148; The research aims to contribute
to knowledge about student engagement by investigating the teacher perspectives
generally ignored in the research literature. This thesis begins with a review of
academic research, scholarship, and government documents where multiple and
conflicting understandings of engagement are identified.
Phenomenography has been chosen as the empirical research approach because it is
designed to map variation in understandings. Standard phenomenographic analysis is
used in conjunction with two frameworks congruent with phenomenography. The first
framework is based on understandings of intentionality and the second on
understandings of awareness. Together these frameworks allow for in-depth analysis
of conceptions by identifying the parts and contexts of conceptions and differentiating
between the participant&#146;s understanding and his or her conception of how this
understanding is facilitated.
The empirical component of the research involves semi-structured interviews with 20
Central Queensland secondary English teachers about their classroom experiences
with student engagement. These data are transcribed and analysed as per
phenomenographic protocol. This study identifies six conceptions within the what
aspect, teacher conceptions of student engagement. These correspond with three
conceptions comprising the how aspect, teacher conceptions of how to facilitate
student engagement.
The findings of the empirical research and scholarly review of literature build
conceptual knowledge about student engagement. This research indicates that
educational stakeholders do not hold similar understandings of student engagement.
If the concept of student engagement is to become educationally fruitful, the term
must be more explicitly defined in educational research and government policy
documents to promote shared understandings among stakeholder groups.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">engagement</field><field name="subject">teacher perspectives</field><field name="subject">phenomenography</field><field name="identifier">http://library-resources.cqu.edu.au./thesis/adt-QCQU/public/adt-QCQU20070718.143103</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Information Systems Decision Making:
Factors Affecting Decision Makers and
Outcomes</field><field name="creator">Jamieson, Bruce (Kieren) James</field><field name="description">Organisations are increasingly reliant on effective information systems (IS) yet little is known about the information and influences that contribute to their selection. Decision makers play an important role in the evaluation, acquisition and implementation of information systems in organisations. Their role during the re-implementation phase of information systems projects is critical, yet little is known about how and why these decisions are made. This thesis explores the influences on these decisions and reports their effects. The aim of this research is to increase the understanding of what occurs during decision making in the critical pre-implementation phase. A cross-disciplinary approach has been employed to develop a research framework informed by literature from information systems, innovation and adoption theory, management decision making and organisational decision making. A qualitative research method was used to develop four exploratory case studies. Research was conducted in private and government organisations that had implemented large information systems. An interpretive hermeneutic text-based analysis technique was used in a cross-case analysis in order to build theory and address the research questions. Fifty-six informational and contextual factors were identified in this research as having effects on information systems pre-implementation decision making. These factors fall into eight broad thematic factor groups: confidence, decision process, opinions, option attributes, organisation, perceptions, politics and vendor attributes. This thesis concludes that there are linkages between decision factors and decision outcomes. It is argued that to achieve positive decision outcomes from information systems preimplementation
decisions, conditions for intra- and inter-organisational alignment must exist. It is also argued that information systems  re-implementation decision outcomes alter intra- and inter-organisational alignment conditions and affect future decisions.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Information Systems</field><field name="subject">Decision Making</field><field name="subject">Alignment</field><field name="subject">Failure</field><field name="subject">Success</field><field name="subject">Factors</field><field name="identifier">http://library-resources.cqu.edu.au./thesis/adt-QCQU/public/adt-QCQU20070626.103825</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The &#145;realities&#146; of part-time nursing in regional Queensland</field><field name="creator">JAMIESON, Lynnette Noela</field><field name="description">There are increasing numbers of Australian nurses working in part-time employment. This is important in a background where contemporary nursing shortages are a considerable barrier to the provision of adequate nursing personnel to meet nursing service demands. An accurate understanding of the situation of part-time nursing is necessary to enable effective human resource management of this segment of the nursing workforce. However, a paucity of available knowledge related to Australian part-time nursing represented a serious gap in the information required for effective and efficient management. Therefore the aim of this study was to discover and describe phenomena and develop theory that explains the &#145;realities&#146; of part-time nursing in regional Queensland. Strauss and Corbin&#146;s (1998) version of the grounded theory approach and methods were used to conduct this study. A sample of 86 regional Queensland part-time nurses and 18 nurse managers and nurse educators provided data that permitted the discovery of a substantive theory of part-time nursing. This theory has contributed knowledge relevant to practitioners in the substantive area by discovering, describing and explaining the phenomenon of part-time nursing, the conditions that influence the phenomenon and the responses that are made to adapt and adjust to the associated challenges. The developed grounded theory represents a significant contribution to the meagre base of knowledge that previously existed by offering insight, enhancing understanding and providing a valuable guide to action.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Part-time employment</field><field name="subject">Nursing</field><field name="subject">Grounded Theory</field><field name="subject">Professional Development</field><field name="identifier">http://library-resources.cqu.edu.au./thesis/adt-QCQU/public/adt-QCQU20060510.094823</field></doc><doc><field name="title">WOMEN IN CENTRAL QUEENSLAND:

undertaken in Central Queensland provides evidence that, although some
similarities existed, the conservative forces in this region restricted the liberating
effect of such changes. It also addresses the subject of Queensland difference, and
argues that the rural patriarchal economy sustained the notion of rigid gender and
class differences in Central Queensland. It maintains that this affected women in
regional Queensland to a far greater extent than those in the Brisbane
metropolitan area because of the lack of secondary wartime industry and the
masculine nature of rural industry. Additionally , in opposition to the widely held
belief there was universal post-war financial security the thesis argues that poverty
did exist. In particular it addresses the subjects of rising inflation and what has

effluent was then pumped though a series of contained channels. The channels were
designed to be a modified evapotranspiration trench; they were comprised of an
aggregate layer and a soil layer in which were planted a variety of plants. The
aggregate and the soil provided physical filtration, the microorganisms within the
effluent, aggregate and soil provided nutrient reuse and transformation and the
plants also used the nutrients and reused the treated effluent through
evapotranspiration. Any effluent that was not transpired was returned to a holding
tank and pumped through the evapotranspiration again. The treatment technology
was assessed in relation to its ability to treat effluent in a sustainable manner. The
water and soil was examined for concentrations of nutrients, heavy metals, salts,
sodium, and organic carbon %. The pH, temperature and number of colony forming
units of certain microorganism potential pathogens were also inspected in the soil
and the water. The plants grown within the evapotranspiration channels were
assessed in regards to their health, water usage, and in some cases potential
pathogens on fruit. The infrastructure that was used to construct the wastewater
treatment and reuse system was also evaluated in regards to reliability and
maintenance. Certain limiting factors, in particular sodicity and salinity were

Both hard-switched and soft-switched half bridge dual converters are constructed,
which are rated at 88W each and transform a nominal 17.6Vdc input to an output in the range from 340V to 360Vdc. An initial prototype converter operated at 100kHz and is used as a base line device to establish the operational behaviours of the converter. The second hard-switched converter operated at 250kHz and included a coaxial matrix transformer that significantly reduced the power losses related to the transformer leakage inductance. The soft-switched converter operated at 1MHz and is capable of absorbing the parasitic elements into the resonant tank. Extensive theoretical analysis, simulation and experimental results are provided for each converter. All three converters
achieved conversion efficiencies around 90%. The progressive increases in the operation frequency, while maintaining the conversion efficiency, will translate into the reduced converter size and weight. Finally different operation modes for the
soft-switched converter are established and the techniques for predicting the occurrence of those modes are developed. The analysis of the effects of the transformer winding capacitance also shows that soft switching condition applies for both the primary side mosfets and the output rectifier diodes.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Photovoltaics</field><field name="subject">Module Integrated Converter</field><field name="subject">High Frequency Converter</field><field name="subject">Half Bridge Dual Converter</field><field name="subject">Coaxial Matrix Transformer</field><field name="subject">DC-DC Converter</field><field name="subject">Soft Switching</field><field name="identifier">http://library-resources.cqu.edu.au./thesis/adt-QCQU/public/adt-QCQU20020807.152750</field></doc><doc><field name="title">HIGH FREQUENCY TRANSFORMER LINKED CONVERTERS
FOR PHOTOVOLTAIC APPLICATIONS</field><field name="creator">LI, QUAN</field><field name="description">This thesis examines converter topologies suitable for Module Integrated Converters
(MICs) in grid interactive photovoltaic (PV) systems, and makes a contribution to
the development of the MIC topologies based on the two-inductor boost converter,
which has received less research interest than other well known converters.
The thesis provides a detailed analysis of the resonant two-inductor boost converter
in the MIC implementations with intermediate constant DC links. Under variable
frequency control, this converter is able to operate with a variable DC gain while
maintaining the resonant condition. A similar study is also provided for the resonant
two-inductor boost converter with the voltage clamp, which aims to increase the
output voltage range while reducing the switch voltage stress. An operating point
with minimized power loss can be also established under the fixed load condition.
Both the hard-switched and the soft-switched current fed two-inductor boost
converters are developed for the MIC implementations with unfolding stages. Nondissipative
snubbers and a resonant transition gate drive circuit are respectively
employed in the two converters to minimize the power loss.
The simulation study of a frequency-changer-based two-inductor boost converter is
also provided. This converter features a small non-polarised capacitor in a second
phase output to provide the power balance in single phase inverter applications.
Four magnetic integration solutions for the two-inductor boost converter have also
been presented and they are promising in reducing the converter size and power loss.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Photovoltaics</field><field name="subject">Module integrated converter</field><field name="subject">High frequency converter</field><field name="subject">DC-DC converter</field><field name="subject">Two-inductor boost converter</field><field name="subject">Soft switching</field><field name="subject">Integrated magnetics</field><field name="subject">Snubber</field><field name="subject">Resonant transition gate drive</field><field name="subject">AC-AC converter</field><field name="identifier">http://library-resources.cqu.edu.au./thesis/adt-QCQU/public/adt-QCQU20060830.110106</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Improving fruit soluble solids content in 
melon (Cucumis melo L.) (reticulatus group) 
in the Australian production system</field><field name="creator">Long, Robert Llewellyn</field><field name="description">Total soluble solids (TSS) is a reliable indicator of melon eating quality, with a minimum standard of 10% recommended.  The state of Australian melon production with respect to this quality criterion was considered within seasons, between growing districts and over seasons.  It was concluded that improvement in agronomic practice and varietal selection is required to produce sweeter melons.  The scientific literature addressing melon physiology and agronomy was summarised, as a background to the work that is required to improve melon production practices in Australia.

The effect of source sink manipulation was assessed for commercially grown and glasshouse grown melon plants.  The timing of fruit thinning, pollination scheduling, the application of a growth inhibitor and source biomass removal were assessed in relation to fruit growth and sugar accumulation.  Results are interpreted against a model in which fruit rapidly increase in weight until about two weeks before harvest, with sugar accumulation continuing as fruit growth ceases.  Thus treatment response is very dependant on timing of application.  For example, fruit thinning at 25 days before harvest resulted in further fruit set and increased fruit weight but did not impact on fruit TSS (at 9.8%, control 9.3%), while thinning at 5 days before harvest resulted in a significant (Pless than 0.05) increase in fruit TSS (to 10.8%, control 9.3%) and no increase in fruit weight or number.  A cost/ benefit analysis is presented, allowing an estimation of the increase in sale price required to sustain the implementation of fruit thinning.   
  

The effect of irrigation scheduling was also considered with respect to increasing melon yield and quality.  To date, recommended practice has been to cause an irrigation deficit close to fruit harvest, with the intent of 'drying out' or 'stressing' the plant, to 'bring on' maturity and increase sugar accumulation.  Irrigation trials showed that keeping plants stress-free close to harvest and during harvest, facilitated the production of sweeter fruit.  

The maintenance of a TSS grade standard using either batch based (destructive) sampling or (non-invasive) grading of individual fruit is discussed.  On-line grading of individual fruit is possible using near infrared spectroscopy (NIR), but the applicability of the technique to melons has received little published attention.  Tissue sampling strategy was optimised, in relation to the optical geometry used (in commercial operation in Australia), both in terms of the diameter and depth of sampled tissue.  NIR calibration model performance was superior when based on the TSS of outer, rather than inner mesocarp tissue.  However the linear relationship between outer and middle tissue TSS was strong (r2 = 0.8) in immature fruit, though less related in maturing fruit (r2 = 0.5).  The effect of fruit storage (maturation/senescence) on calibration model performance was assessed.  There was a negligible effect of fruit cold storage on calibration performance.

Currently, the agronomist lacks a cost-effective tool to rapidly assess fruit TSS in the field.  Design parameters for such a tool were established, and several optical front ends compared for rapid, though invasive, analysis.  Further, for visualisation of the spatial distribution of tissue TSS within a melon fruit, a two-dimensional, or hyper-spectral NIR imaging system based on a low cost 8-bit charge coupled device (CCD) camera and filter arrangement, was designed and characterised.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">total soluble solids</field><field name="subject">TSS</field><field name="subject">sugar</field><field name="subject">standards</field><field name="subject">fruit quality</field><field name="subject">eating quality</field><field name="subject">melon irrigation</field><field name="subject">irrigation</field><field name="subject">melon thinning</field><field name="subject">fruit thinning</field><field name="subject">fruit imaging</field><field name="subject">hyperspectral imaging</field><field name="subject">imaging</field><field name="subject">near infrared</field><field name="subject">NIR</field><field name="subject">melon</field><field name="subject">melon agronomy</field><field name="subject">rockmelon</field><field name="subject">cantaloupe</field><field name="subject">muskmelon</field><field name="subject">inline sorting</field><field name="subject">avocado</field><field name="subject">banana</field><field name="subject">citrus</field><field name="subject">custard apple</field><field name="subject">grapes</field><field name="subject">kiwifruit</field><field name="subject">lychee</field><field name="subject">mango</field><field name="subject">papaya</field><field name="subject">pineapple</field><field name="subject">pome fruit</field><field name="subject">stone fruit</field><field name="subject">stonefruit</field><field name="subject">strawberry</field><field name="subject">tomato</field><field name="subject">postharvest</field><field name="subject">agronomy</field><field name="subject">horticulture</field><field name="subject">spectroscopy</field><field name="identifier">http://library-resources.cqu.edu.au./thesis/adt-QCQU/public/adt-QCQU20051019.144749</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Intelligent support systems in agriculture:
A study of their adoption and use</field><field name="creator">Lynch, Teresa Ann</field><field name="description">Australian agriculture is one area in which a number of intelligent support systems have been developed.  It appears, however, that comparatively few of these systems are widely used or have the impact the developers might have wished.  In this study a possible explanation for this state of affairs was investigated.  The development process for 66 systems was examined.  Particular attention was paid to the nature of user involvement, if any, during development and the relationship to system success.
The issue is not only whether there was user involvement but rather the nature of the involvement, that is, the degree of influence users had during development.  The patterns identified in the analysis suggest user influence is an important contributor to the success of a system.  These results have theoretical significance in that they add to knowledge of the role of the user in the development of intelligent support systems.  The study has drawn together work from three areas: Rogers&#146; diffusion theory, the technology acceptance model, and theories relating to user involvement in the development of information systems.  Most prior research in the information systems area has investigated one or two of the above three areas in any one study.  The study synthesizes this knowledge through applying it to the field of intelligent support systems in Australian agriculture.  The results have considerable practical significance, as apparently developers of intelligent support systems in Australian agriculture do not recognize the importance of user participation, and continue to develop systems with less than optimum impact.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">user involvement</field><field name="subject">adoption</field><field name="subject">decision support systems</field><field name="subject">expert systems</field><field name="subject">agriculture</field><field name="identifier">http://library-resources.cqu.edu.au./thesis/adt-QCQU/public/adt-QCQU20040131.101933</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Stochastic Disaggregation of Daily Rainfall for Fine Timescale Design Storms</field><field name="creator">Mahbub, S. M. Parvez Bin</field><field name="description">Rainfall data are usually gathered at daily timescales due to the availability of daily rain-gauges throughout the world. However, rainfall data at fine timescale are required for certain hydrologic modellings such as crop simulation modelling, erosion modelling etc. Limited availability of such data leads to the option of daily rainfall disaggregation. This research investigates the use of a stochastic rainfall disaggregation model on a regional basis to disaggregate daily rainfall into any desired fine timescale in the State of Queensland, Australia. With the incorporation of seasonality into the variance relationship and capping of the fine timescale maximum intensities, the model was found to be a useful tool for disaggregating daily rainfall in the regions of Queensland. The degree of model complexity in terms of binary chain parameter calibration was also reduced by using only three parameters for Queensland. The resulting rainfall Intensity-Frequency-Duration (IFD) curves better predicted the intensities at fine timescale durations compared with the existing Australian Rainfall and Runoff (ARR) approach. The model has also been linked to the SILO Data Drill synthetic data to disaggregate daily rainfall at sites where limited or no fine timescale observed data are available. This research has analysed the fine timescale rainfall properties at various sites in Queensland and established sufficient confidence in using the model for Queensland.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">daily rainfall</field><field name="subject">design storms</field><field name="subject">fine timescale</field><field name="subject">stochastic disaggregation</field><field name="subject">modelling</field><field name="identifier">http://library-resources.cqu.edu.au./thesis/adt-QCQU/public/adt-QCQU20080813.151345</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Changing mindsets:   A study of Queensland primary teachers and the visual literacy initiative</field><field name="creator">McDougall, Jenny Kay</field><field name="description">'Changing mindsets' is about how teachers are engaging with &#145;visual literacy&#146; &#151; the  practices involved in understanding and creating visual texts. The concept of &#145;visual  literacy&#146;, like other &#145;new&#146; literacies, has arisen in response to changing communication  practices in developed, capitalist societies like Australia. This study addresses the  ways in which teachers in primary schools are engaging with the visual literacy  initiative in the context of the new arts syllabus (Years 1-10) in Queensland.    

Using a broadly poststructural approach, this thesis explored the changing mindsets  implied by this curriculum initiative from three perspectives. The concept of  &#145;preservation of self&#146; (Nias, 1987, 1993) was used to examine the personal dimension  of change; the concept of &#145;trendy theory&#146; (Goodson, 1988, 1994, 1997) addressed the  social and political agendas that drive curriculum reform; while the concept of  &#145;multimodality&#146; (Kress, 2000a, 2000b, 2003a, 2003b) drew attention to the cultural  values ascribed to different modes of communication. Semi-structured interviews  were conducted with 26 primary teachers from 11 government schools in a regional  centre in 2002. The discourse analysis method was used to analyse the data resulting  from these interviews.     

The data showed that the official discourses featured in the new arts syllabus did not  match the discourses used by practising teachers. Although there was some  recognition of the significance of the visual mode, most teachers in this study were  not aware of &#145;visual literacy&#146;. Significantly, the agency exercised by teachers in  curriculum reform was shaped not only by their personal identities, but also by the  levels of support that they experienced in their working environments. These findings  have crucial implications for policy-makers in implementing curriculum change,  particularly in the context of the new arts syllabus.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">visual literacy</field><field name="subject">visual mode</field><field name="subject">multimodality</field><field name="subject">multiliteracies</field><field name="subject">curriculum change</field><field name="subject">teachers and change</field><field name="subject">art education</field><field name="subject">media education</field><field name="identifier">http://library-resources.cqu.edu.au./thesis/adt-QCQU/public/adt-QCQU20050502.120010</field></doc><doc><field name="title">First steps in becoming a teacher: Initial teacher education students&#146; perceptions of why they want to teach.</field><field name="creator">McDougall, Mary Catherine</field><field name="description">This thesis focuses on why prospective teachers want to teach. It argues that prospective teachers draw on their own perceptions of what teaching means to them and that these perceptions are clarified and refined during the initial stages of their university study. Firstly, it examines what attracts and holds first year student teachers to teaching and whether they really want to be teachers. Secondly, it compares students&#146; perceptions of teaching at the start, during and at the end of their first year of their first year of university studies. Finally, it identifies the kind of early experiences at university and school sites that can either strengthen the initial commitment to become a teacher or might lessen the original desire to teach.

The context of the study is a regional university in a provincial city in Central Queensland. The selection of constructivism as a theoretical framework informed the research approach and allowed data to be gathered in a case study format using an iterative process to permit probing and identification of change, and reconstruction of relevant issues. In this research, data was collected through three individual interviews with nine first year prospective student teachers at the beginning, mid and end of that year. Constructivist analysis concepts were employed to draw from the data coded patterns, themes and issues displaying student teachers&#146; emerging perceptions of their first year of learning how to teach.

The thesis reports that student teachers in their initial year were enabled to articulate their co-construction of what it means to be a teacher. During the year they were able to build up their construction of what it means to be a teacher which, over time, alleviated earlier uncertainties as their decision to teach was affirmed. The process of construction of being a teacher identified qualities, knowledge and skills identified from the start to the end of the program, building from perceptions to reality, from the old to the new.
Conceptions of teaching as work, and the importance of relationships in teaching contributed to the satisfaction of student teachers and helped affirm their commitment in anticipating their future as a teacher. The findings of the study exemplify that a well-structured, collaborative teacher education program in the initial year will attract and retain many prospective teachers. This thesis gives a wider understanding of the first year of a teaching career.

The research builds a contemporary picture of what prospective teachers think about teaching in their first year of a teacher education program. The issues and problems identified in the context of a regional campus, underpin the results of this research. This research enables students&#146; voices to be heard and will inform teacher educators and others involved in teacher education to examine specific cases in the attraction and retention of prospective teachers.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">teacher</field><field name="subject">education students perceptions</field><field name="subject">student teacher perceptions</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://library-resources.cqu.edu.au./thesis/adt-QCQU/public/adt-QCQU20050531.142515</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Quilting Professional Stories: A Gendered Experience Of Choosing Social Work As A Career.</field><field name="creator">Mensinga, Joanna Tempe</field><field name="description">The literature and research investigating why people choose social work as a career has tended to focus on motivational traits rather than on the choice experience itself. Whereas the vocational sector has moved to include a focus on the narrative processes involved with selecting a career, much of the social work research fails to capture the meaning-making processes individuals engage in to make sense of their career choices within their personal and social contexts. This research project describes the meaning-making processes two students participating in the social work program at Central Queensland University and I employ to understand our career choice experiences. Over a period of four years, using a research approach that combines Clandinin and Connelly&#146;s (2000) narrative inquiry with Riessman&#146;s (2003) emphasis on social positioning within narratives, Geraldine, John and I explore the interplay between individual, community and professional agendas in our past, present and imagined career choice experiences &#150; particularly focusing on the impact of gender. Identifying the importance of caring as a hallmark of the profession and what draws us to social work, this co-constructed research text highlights the agendas that predominantly support women&#146;s entrance into the profession and challenge men&#146;s participation. Drawing on the metaphor of a quilt to describe our career choice experience, this project draws attention to the importance for aspiring social workers to carefully choose, cut and join together bits of gendered narrative material to create a professional story that both legitimises their entrance into the profession and to position them within the larger career sector.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">career choice</field><field name="subject">social work</field><field name="subject">narrative inquiry</field><field name="subject">gender</field><field name="identifier">http://library-resources.cqu.edu.au./thesis/adt-QCQU/public/adt-QCQU20070131.142713</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Microarray Analysis of the Schistosoma japonicum Transcriptome</field><field name="creator">Moertel, Luke Paul Frank</field><field name="description">Schistosomiasis, a disease of humans caused by helminth parasites of the genus Schistosoma, kills 200 to 500 thousand people annually, endangering over 600 million people world-wide with 200 million people infected in 2003 [1, 2]. Three species of schistosome are primarily responsible for human infections, namely, Schistosoma haematobium, endemic to Africa, India, and the Middle East, S. mansoni, endemic to Africa / South America, and S. japonicum endemic to China and the Philippines [3]. The major pathological effects of schistosomiasis result from the deposition of parasite ova in human tissues and the subsequent intense granulomatous response induced by these eggs. There is a high priority to provide an effective sub-unit vaccine against these schistosome flukes, using proteins encoded by cDNAs expressed by the parasites at critical phases of their development. One technique that may expedite this gene identification is the use of microarrays for expression analysis. A 22,575 feature custom oligonucleotide DNA microarray designed from public domain databases of schistosome ESTs (Expressed Sequence Tags) was used to explore differential gene expression between the Philippine (SJP) and Chinese (SJC) strains of S. japonicum, and between males and females. It was found that 593, 664 and 426 probes were differentially expressed between the two geographical strains when mix sexed adults, male worms and female worms were compared respectively. Additionally, the study revealed that 1,163 male- and 1,016 female-associated probes were differentially expressed in SJP whereas 1,047 male- and 897 female-associated probes were differentially expressed in SJC [4]. Further to this, a detailed real time PCR expression study was used to explore the differential expression of eight genes of interest throughout the SJC life cycle, which showed that several of the genes were down-regulated in different life cycle stages. The study has greatly expanded previously published data of strain and gender-associated differential expression in S. japonicum. Further, the new data will provide a stepping stone for understanding the complexities of the biology, sexual differentiation, maturation, and development of human schistosomes, signaling new approaches for identifying novel intervention and diagnostic targets against schistosomiasis [4].</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Schistosomiasis; Schistosoma japonicum; Chinese strain; Philippine strain; Strain-specific differences; Gender-specific differences</field><field name="identifier">http://library-resources.cqu.edu.au./thesis/adt-QCQU/public/adt-QCQU20070705.120939</field></doc><doc><field name="title">THE GAP BETWEEN HOPE AND HAPPENING:
FEMINIST CONSCIOUSNESS MEETS
PNALLOCENTRIC SMOG IN A REGIONAL
AUSTRALIAN UNIVERSITY</field><field name="creator">Moore, Teresa Gaye</field><field name="description">The gap between hope and happening refers to the experiences of four academic women
who work at Milton University (MU), the pseudonym for a regional Australian
university. This thesis is concerned with the ways in which discourses circulating within
MU shape the performances and discursive positionings of the four women - Alice,
Madonna, Veronica and Tamaly (all pseudonyms) - and how, in turn, these women
negotiate these discourses. Data are drawn from the women&#146;s narratives, university
policy documents and selected institutional texts. A feminist poststructuralist lens
interrogates both policies, reflecting different approaches towards gender equity at MU,
and discursive practices, constructing the &#145;good academic&#146; at MU.
Instead of acts of resistance, what is revealed in this workplace is the continuing covert
strategies of marginalization that reproduce women&#146;s positioning on the margins of
mainstream academia, indicating the presence of a kind of &#145;phallocentnc smog&#146; emerging
from a dominant masculine culture. This thesis finds a gap between the transformative
potential of the four women at the micro-social (subjectivity) level and the lack of
transformation at the macro-social (workplace) level. This suggests that the women&#146;s
abilities to resist and transform phallocentric discourses at the personal/private level are
not sustainable at the public level because of the enduring power of normative
institutional discourses or the &#145;phallocentric smog&#146;. This thesis signals the need for ongoing
interrogation of the gap between the hope that feminists have (theory) and the
happening for women (practice) in the quest for sustainable equity.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">feminist theory</field><field name="subject">subjectivity</field><field name="subject">phallocentric smog</field><field name="subject">discourse</field><field name="identifier">http://library-resources.cqu.edu.au./thesis/adt-QCQU/public/adt-QCQU20060921.120629</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies on Wheel/Rail Contact &#150; Impact Forces at Insulated Rail Joints</field><field name="creator">Pang, Tao</field><field name="description">To investigate the wheel/rail contact impact forces at insulated rail joints (IRJs), a three-dimensional finite element model and strain gauged experiments are employed and reported in this thesis. The 3D wheel/rail contact-impact FE model adopts a two-stage analysis strategy in which the wheel-IRJ railhead contact is first established in the static analysis and the results transferred to dynamic analysis for impact simulations. The explicit FE method was employed in the dynamic analysis. The Lagrange Multiplier method and the Penalty method for contact constraint enforcement were adopted for the static and dynamic analyses respectively. 

The wheel/rail contact-impact in the vicinity of the end post is exhibited via numerical examples from the FE modelling. The wheel/rail contact impact mechanism is investigated. The strain gauged experiments which consist of a lab test and a field test are reported. The signature of the strain time series from the field test demonstrates a plausible record of the dynamic responses due to the wheel/rail contact impact. By using the experimental data, both the static and the dynamic FE models are validated.

It is found that the stiffness discontinuity of the IRJ structure causes a running surface geometry discontinuity during the wheel passages which then causes the impact in the vicinity of the end post. Through a series of sensitivity studies of several IRJ design parameters, it is shown that the IRJ performance can be effectively improved with optimised design parameters.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Insulated Rail Joints</field><field name="subject">IRJ performance</field><field name="subject">impact forces</field><field name="subject">wheel / rail contact</field><field name="subject">dynamic responses</field><field name="subject">finite element modelling</field><field name="identifier">http://library-resources.cqu.edu.au./thesis/adt-QCQU/public/adt-QCQU20080410.154708</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Effect of Workplace Exposure on Professional
Commitment: A Longitudinal Study of Nursing Professionals.</field><field name="creator">Parry, Julianne Mary</field><field name="description">The behaviour of employees is increasingly being recognised as the critical
factor in achievement of organisational effectiveness. Therefore, the need to address
inefficiencies that are derived from the organisation-employee relationship is being
recognised as important to organisational success. For many years the concept of
organisational commitment provided the means to develop theory in relation to
organisation-employee relationships. More recently, however, other types of workrelated
commitments have been identified as having importance to the organisationemployee
relationship.
In the contemporary political-economic context, professionals are
increasingly becoming employees of organisations which operate according to
market or quasi-market principles. There are some fundamental differences between
professional occupations and non-professional occupations. These differences may
have consequences for the relationship between professional employees and their
employing organisation. The differences may also have consequences for other workrelated
outcomes for professional employees in ways that are different from the
work-related outcomes of non-professional employees. Importantly, for professional
employees commitment to the profession is developed during the pre-workplace
entry educational experiences and may have consequences for the retention of
professional employees within organisations, as well as retention within the
profession. Therefore, the commitment of professional employees to their occupation
may be both an antecedent to and a consequence of other work-related outcomes.
However, to date, professional commitment has not been studied from a
developmental perspective and the effect of workplace exposure on professional
commitment is not understood.
This thesis reports the findings of a study in which a theoretical model of the
relationship between professional commitment prior to workplace entry and
professional turnover intention was evaluated using path analysis. The relationships
included in the model were between commitment to the profession as both an
antecedent to, and a consequence of organisational-professional conflict, job
satisfaction and organisational commitment, as well as the relationship that each of
these variables may have to organisational turnover intention and professional
turnover intention. A repeated measures design was used with a sample of nursing
professionals. Professional commitment before entry to the workplace was measured,
and after a period of workplace exposure, professional commitment was again
measured, as well as the other work-related outcomes identified in the model. The
Blau (2003) occupational commitment measure was used to measure the pre-and-post
workplace entry levels of professional commitment. The thesis also examined the
factor structure of the Blau (2003) occupational commitment measure.
The results of the model evaluation indicated that it is a plausible model of
the identified relationships. Examination of the factor structure of the Blau (2003)
occupational commitment measure indicated that it is best represented by five rather
than four components. This research found that professional commitment was quite
stable in the initial period of workplace exposure. The research findings also
indicated that the relationship between professional commitment and organisational
commitment was mediated by job satisfaction and that organisational-professional
conflict and job satisfaction were directly related to organisational commitment. The
research found that job satisfaction and professional commitment after a period of
workplace exposure were related to organisational turnover intention, but that
organisational commitment was not. The final major research finding was that
organisational turnover intention was the only workplace variable in the model that
was directly related to professional turnover intention.
This research has contributed to the organisational behaviour literature
through the development and initial evaluation of a model of the relationship between
professional commitment prior to workplace entry and professional turnover
intention. The results of the model suggested that when organisations provide
professional employees with workplace experiences that are professionally, as well as
personally satisfying, they promote retention of professional employees with their
own organisation, as well as retention of professionals within the profession.
This research recommends that for organisations that employ professionals,
the model of the organisation-professional employee relationship that is likely to
promote the retention of professional employees both within the organisation and
within the profession, is a partnership model. Conflict resolution principles are
recommended to inform the partnership model of the organisation-professional
employee relationship. In addition, the empowering leadership style is recommended
for organisations that employ professionals, because it is better matched to the
employment mode and characteristics of professional employees.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Professional commitment</field><field name="subject">organisational commitment</field><field name="subject">job satisfaction</field><field name="subject">organisational-professional conflict</field><field name="subject">organisational turnover intention</field><field name="subject">professional turnover intention</field><field name="subject">nursing professionals</field><field name="identifier">http://library-resources.cqu.edu.au./thesis/adt-QCQU/public/adt-QCQU20070524.133840</field></doc><doc><field name="title">EVALUATION AND MODELLING PERFORMANCE OF
CAPPING LAYER IN RAIL TRACK SUBSTRUCTURE</field><field name="creator">RADAMPOLA, Senanie Sujeewa</field><field name="description">In the design of rail track structures where the subgrade cannot achieve the desired
capacity, enabling the required standard of track geometry to be maintained for the speed,
axle load and tonnage to be hauled, a capping layer of granular material is placed
between the natural ground or the embankment fill material and the ballast to protect the
underlying weaker layers.
In spite of the important role played by the capping layer, very little research has been
carried out on its performance. The current practice of design of the capping layer,
therefore, is based on working stress philosophy where reduced levels of stresses are
assumed not to degrade the subgrade. Even on tracks containing a thick ballast layer that
ensures allowable levels of working stress the subgrade has been found to have
permanently deformed. Design of capping layers based on plastic deformation,
therefore, appears appropriate. This thesis aims at determining the load levels that cause
detrimental plastic deformation in the capping layer.
The suite of material properties that characterise plastic deformations of capping layer is
neither readily available nor easily determined. This thesis proposes a cheaper method of
evaluating a range of capping layer material properties using penetration tests on
specimens contained in California Bearing Ratio (CBR) test moulds coupled with a finite
element modelling based back calculation technique. The suite of material properties

in Australian Train Brake Systems</field><field name="creator">Ripley, Ian</field><field name="description">An investigation of brake application delays in Australian train brake systems
began with a literature review of pneumatic train braking systems. Data located in the
review gave examples of brake application delays of pre 1990 designs from the U.K.,
India and North America. Information on application delays on later Australian designs
was scarce. Reading of literature has shown a difference between the Australian and
North American control valves in the way the propagation of the pressure reduction rate
in the brake pipe is maintained. Control valves of the North American style allow the
brake pipe air to be connected for a short time to a small cavity or quick service volume
of each valve. The quick service volume is then released to atmosphere. The action of
exhausting a small amount of air from the brake pipe helps to ensure a propagation of an
adequate pressure reduction rate as it travels to the next valve. Australian control valves
rely on the ratio of the volume of brake pipe between control valves and the size of the
quick service volume or &#145;bulb&#146; to ensure the propagation of an adequate pressure
reduction as it travels to the next valve. The air in a bulb of an Australian valve is not
expelled to atmosphere until a brake release is made.
The research explored possible reductions in application delays by utilizing an
experimental pipe test rack that included 4 control valves and 120 meters of brake pipe.
Experiments with different configurations of exhaust orifices or chokes, valves and
branch pipe lengths that supplied the valves gave a record acquired by data acquisition
of the timing of each valve and the local pressure drop from a valve or each valve for
comparison.
Experiments with exhaust chokes that gave a reduction drop rate in the brake pipe
that approached the minimum required to operate a control valve resulted in instability
of the application operation of the control valve. The quick service volume of different
sizes was included in the experiments to give comparisons in the propagation of the
pressure reduction toward the end of a long train. Further increases into the size of the
bulb of a control valve to enhance the propagation features toward the end of a long
train are discussed. The branch pipe with different diameters from 12 mm to 20 mm and
lengths from 160 mm to 800 mm when fitted to an adaptor pipe bracket were
investigated and results show that larger diameters gave larger gulps in the brake pipe.
Other components that were studied included the pipe bracket that is fitted on some
control valves. The pipe bracket and isolation cock was found to add 282 mm of
additional length to the air path and while not changing the operation of the valve, the
results showed a smaller drop in local pressure in the brake pipe to assist the pressure
reduction rate than shown in valves without pipe brackets.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Air Brakes</field><field name="subject">Railway</field><field name="subject">Propagation</field><field name="identifier">http://library-resources.cqu.edu.au./thesis/adt-QCQU/public/adt-QCQU20060720.100110</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ecologically Engineered Primary Production in Central Queensland, Australia - Integrated Fish and Crayfish Culture, Constructed Wetlands, Floral Hydroponics, and Industrial Wastewater.</field><field name="creator">Roe, Brett</field><field name="description">The issue of sustainability has greatest significance in the midst of unilateral bio-socioeconomic degradation resulting from intense and increasing societal pressures placed on the unified global ecology. In such an environment, sustainable development seeks to manage natural resources within a free market economy, aiming to meet the needs of today's population, and to protect and enhance current resource quality and abundance. In this light, techniques of integrated sustainable primary production and wastewater management are the subject matters of this applied research. There are many researchable issues which could be addressed within the subject matter. The first focus in the research scope was driven by the most severe sustainability issue facing Central Queensland (Australia) in 2000: the depletion and degradation of freshwater supplies. Central Queensland (CQ) is an arid sub-tropical region that has suffered from a marked reduction in rainfall and increase in temperature over the last 100 years, {Miles, 2004 #172}, and by the year 2000, conditions had been exacerbated by eight years of severe drought and warmer than average temperatures and resulted in widespread animal and crop failures due to freshwater shortages. Such a problem required a multi-faceted ecological, social, and economic approach. Hence, research centred on investigating the science of integrating regional water-related industries and agribusiness, and biodiverse ecosystems to achieve water and wastewater reuse applications, and associated eco-socioeconomic benefits. Specifically, this research investigates the integration of (a) electrical power station wastewater (b) barramundi culture, (c) red claw culture, (d) constructed wetlands (for water quality management and habitat creation), and (e) hydroponic flower culture. This research produced outcomes of integrated water and wastewater reuse and recycling, marketable agriproducts production (fish, crayfish, and flowers), water and wastewater reuse and conservation, wetland primary production, carbon dioxide sequestration, aquatic pollution control, and biodiversity creation and support. Successful design and management, experimental trialing and evaluation of system components and subjects, and the development of a knowledge base including static and dynamic system models, represent advances in respective research areas, and underpin the emerging discipline of integrated systems approaches to eco-socioeconomic development. Additionally, several gaps in the current body of knowledge regarding integrated systems were filled, and interactive management tools were developed. Apart from this study, the integration of technologies (as described above) has not, to this author's knowledge, been accomplished.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">fish</field><field name="subject">crayfish</field><field name="subject">wetland</field><field name="subject">aquaponic</field><field name="subject">integrated</field><field name="subject">hydroponic</field><field name="subject">polyculture</field><field name="subject">industrial</field><field name="subject">wastewater</field><field name="subject">rose</field><field name="subject">Lates Calcarifer</field><field name="subject">Cherax quadricarinatus</field><field name="subject">Schoenoplectus validus</field><field name="subject">Bauinea articulate</field><field name="subject">Littoria falla</field><field name="subject">Velesunio ambiguous</field><field name="subject">mass balance</field><field name="subject">metals</field><field name="subject">aquaculture</field><field name="subject">water quality</field><field name="identifier">http://library-resources.cqu.edu.au./thesis/adt-QCQU/public/adt-QCQU20080717.092551</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluation of the effects of tree clearing over time on soil properties, pasture composition and productivity</field><field name="creator">Sangha, Kamaljit Kaur</field><field name="description">Tree clearing is practised for greater beef production and hence monetary gains from grazing
systems of central Queensland. The high rates of clearing in the past and even recently (577,
000 ha/yr during 1999-2001) were mainly to develop land for pastures. The sustainability of
cleared pasture systems over the long-term is questioned.
Three major types of tree communities i.e. Eucalyptus populnea F. Muell., E. melanophloia F.
Muell. and Acacia harpophylla F. Muell. ex. Benth. were selected on one property in central
Queensland to quantify the impacts of clearing on pasture production and composition, and
soil properties. The impacts were measured over time-since-clearing (recent (&amp;lt5 years),
medium (11-13years) and old (&amp;gt30 years)) in unreplicated cleared pastures in comparison to
their replicated uncleared/intact woodland pastures of each tree community.
Measures of pasture above-ground biomass production on a single property over time-sinceclearing
in cleared systems showed that gains were not sustained over the long-term. The
difference in response to clearing between tree communities was evident and important to
support the future policy decisions. The impact of clearing on soil properties (physicochemical
and biological) was confirmed, and explained the lesser availability of nutrients with
time of clearing in cleared pastures. The changes in some soil properties underscored the
associated risks and changes in ecosystem functions due to clearing. Less litter was produced
at cleared than uncleared pastures, but nutrient release was faster at cleared compared to
uncleared systems. The overall effect of clearing in terms of pasture and litter production, and
major soil parameters were analysed using multivariate analyses.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">litter production and decomposition</field><field name="subject">grassland</field><field name="subject">pasture production</field><field name="subject">pasture plant diversity</field><field name="subject">pasture systems</field><field name="subject">soil properties</field><field name="subject">soil respiration</field><field name="subject">tree clearing</field><field name="subject">woodland</field><field name="identifier">http://library-resources.cqu.edu.au./thesis/adt-QCQU/public/adt-QCQU20060921.115258</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The predominance of women in public relations</field><field name="creator">SMITH, Gregory Michael</field><field name="description">As (almost) everyone in the Australian public relations industry knows, there
are more women than men. On average, the numbers in Perth (and
nationally) favour women by slightly more than three to one. However, the
figures are alarmingly high, and, according to Australian Bureau of Statistics
figures, make PR one of the most female-intensive industries in Australia.
This growing imbalance may have long-term effects which have yet to be
identified. This thesis, however, seeks to consider the reasons for this
situation.
The research aims to:
1. Examine the reasons for the growth in numbers of women and
numerical decline of men within public relations in Perth,
Western Australia, by considering the development of public
relations and how it has impacted on the composition of the
profession.
2. Examine future trends within the profession for both women
and men and what an imbalance may mean.
Patterns in the data clearly show that women outnumber men by almost 3:1,
with statistics consistent across all groups surveyed. For example, in
government PR practitioners are 71 per cent female, while in private practice
(both nationally and in WA) it is 74 per cent. In WA charities the figure is 75
per cent. At the universities it varies between 72 and 87 per cent. This study
examines the reason for the imbalance and whether an imbalance is good.
Whether the industry (professional bodies, educators, students and
practitioners) is concerned is up to it.
This work provides the first study of the gender composition of the industry
in Australia. As such, it should be a valuable tool in a number of areas. Like
many initial studies, it raises just as many questions as answers, and it
provides pathways for future study. It should lead to a wider examination of
further issues. For example: does the predominance of women in PR in
university courses cause concern among male students, perhaps leading them
to question their continued participation? Do male students wonder whether
the female dominance of PR courses will lessen their chances of
employment. And what do practitioners think of an industry that is feminine?</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Public relations</field><field name="subject">PR</field><field name="subject">journalism</field><field name="subject">gender imbalance</field><field name="subject">discrimination</field><field name="subject">media</field><field name="identifier">http://library-resources.cqu.edu.au./thesis/adt-QCQU/public/adt-QCQU20070524.134535</field></doc><doc><field name="title">EVALUATION OF SEDIMENTATION PROCESSES IN
A COASTAL LAKE: CAUSEWAY LAKE,
THE CAPRICORN COAST CASE STUDY</field><field name="creator">Soetanto, Budi</field><field name="description">This thesis presents analysis of the hydrodynamic and sedimentation changes of the Causeway Lake, Queensland. It was created in 1939 when a causeway and bridge construction was built across the estuary entrance. Since the construction, significant sediment retention has occurred in the lake. The sediment study presented in this thesis was undertaken based on historical data, field data measurement and numerical modelling, supported by theoretical analysis.
Based on bathymetry data for the period from 1986 and 2003, an average of 2500 m3/year of sediment has settled in the estuary. To verify the sources of sedimentation, field measurements were undertaken at selected sections at two upstream boundaries (Mulambin and Shoal Creeks), and at the downstream boundary under the bridge.
Four sets of field measurements with tidal elevation up to 4.5 m (0.8 m above the bridge sill) were analysed. Results showed that sediment transport in from the sea side was about 1050 m3/year and from the catchments area was in the order of 1100 m3/year (wash load was not included).
Implementation of numerical modelling using RMA required calibration using field data. The predicted sediment transport was in order of 2900 m3/year. The calibrated model was used to simulate the sedimentation pattern for the next 10 years. Four scenarios were analysed, and the resulting recommendation was to dredge out about 141,000 m3 sediment from the Mulambin Creek branch area. Other solutions were also suggested: improvement of lake management and possibility to raise the sill level (water gate).</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sedimentation</field><field name="subject">Siltation</field><field name="subject">Causeway Lake</field><field name="subject">Estuary</field><field name="subject">Surface Water</field><field name="subject">Lake Hydrodynamic.</field><field name="identifier">http://library-resources.cqu.edu.au./thesis/adt-QCQU/public/adt-QCQU20070622.122252</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Changing meaning: The leading way</field><field name="creator">Sytsma, Sandra</field><field name="description">In studying leading as a way of changing meaning, this research documents a journey of inner exploration amongst five self-nominated leaders in education.

Over a period of almost a year, the leaders participated in an online project, travelling together through email dialogue focused around leading, changing and meaning. In this, they experimented with a changing way of researching, developing a personalised space of changing in which they could truth-test their thoughts and feelings about the multiple facets of leading and meaning. Such a space - interstitial to their outer working and inner personal lives, but deeply connective of both - was found useful in supporting coherent change processes in the participant leaders.

Measurement of instantaneous velocity using
Particle Image Velocimetry</field><field name="creator">Tabassum, Rasheed</field><field name="description">Gibbsite scale growth in pipe fittings is a major problem for an alumina refinery. A recent
investigation into the scale growth mechanism at an alumina refinery found almost 60 % more
scale growth in a reducer when compared with the connecting straight pipe sections for similar
flow conditions.
Scale growth occurs where liquor (supersaturated solutions) come in contact with solid surfaces
and it is affected by the liquor flow velocity besides other physical and chemical parameters. The
present work is dedicated to study the hydro-dynamical aspects of the mechanism of scale
growth. In particular, the role of the phenomenon of turbulent bursting, stream wise and cross
stream fluctuating velocity components (Ux and Uy) was investigated as the flow moves through
the reducer. Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) technique was used to get a full view of the
reducer and the readings close-to-the-wall of the reducer at Reynolds number of 27,000 and
44,000 upstream which corresponds to Reynolds number of 41,500 and 66,000 downstream of
the reducer respectively.
The results showed an increase in cross stream and a decrease in magnitude of stream wise
fluctuating velocity components, whereby we presume that the increased cross stream fluctuating
velocity component increases the frequency of impacts of the scaling particles on the wall thus
initiating excessive scale growth in the reducer when compared with the connecting straight pipe
sections, for similar flow conditions.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Gibbsite Scale</field><field name="subject">Bayer Process</field><field name="subject">Concentric Reducer</field><field name="subject">PIV</field><field name="identifier">http://library-resources.cqu.edu.au./thesis/adt-QCQU/public/adt-QCQU20060720.095421</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evolutionary Learning of Control and Strategies in Robot Soccer</field><field name="creator">Thomas, Peter James</field><field name="description">Robot soccer provides a fertile environment for the development of artificial intelligence techniques.  Robot controls require high speed lower level reactive layers as well as higher level deliberative functions.

This thesis focuses on a number of aspects in the robot soccer arena.  Topics covered include boundary avoidance strategies, vision detection and the application of evolutionary learning to find fuzzy controllers for the control of mobile robot.

A three input, two output controller using two angles and a distance as the input and producing two wheel velocity outputs, was developed using evolutionary learning. Current wheel velocities were excluded from the input.  The controller produced was a coarse control permitting only either forward or reverse facing impact with the ball.  A five input controller was developed which expanded upon the three input model by including the current wheel velocities as inputs.  The controller allowed both forward and reverse facing impacts with the ball.

A five input hierarchical three layer model was developed to reduce the number of rules to be learnt by an evolutionary algorithm.  Its performance was the same as the five input model.

Fuzzy clustering of evolved paths was limited by the information available from the paths. The information was sparse in many areas and did not produce a controller that could be used to control the robots.

Research was also conducted on the derivation of simple obstacle avoidance strategies for robot soccer.  A new decision region method for colour detection in the UV colour map to enable better detection of the robots using an overhead vision system.

risk assessment but nothing that combines these two topics. This thesis is focused at
assessing derailment risks developed due to longitudinal train dynamics. A key
focus of this thesis is to identify strategies that can be field implemented to correctly
manage these risks. This thesis quantifies derailment risk and allows a datum for
comparison. A derailment risk assessment on longitudinal train dynamics was
studied for a 107 vehicle train consist travelling along the Monto and North Coast
Lines in Queensland, Australia. The train consisted of 103 wagons and 4
locomotives with locomotives positioned in groups of two in lead and mid train
positions. The wagons were empty hopper wagons on a track gauge of 1067mm.
The scenarios studied include: the effect of longitudinal impacts on wagon dynamics
in transition curves; and the effects of longitudinal steady forces on wagon dynamics
on curves. Simulation software packages VAMPIRE and CRE-LTS were used.
The effects of longitudinal impacts from in-train forces on wagon dynamics in curves
were studied using longitudinal train simulation and detailed wagon dynamics
simulation. In-train force impacts were produced using a train control action. The
resulting worst-case in-train forces resulting from these simulations were applied to
the coupler pin of the wagon dynamics simulation model. The wagon model was
used to study the effect of these in-train forces when applied in curves and transitions
at an angle to the wagon longitudinal axis. The effects of different levels of coupler
impact forces resulting from different levels of coupling slack were also studied.
Maximum values for wheel unloading and L/V ratio for various curve radii and
coupler slack conditions were identified. The results demonstrated that the
derailment criteria for wheel unloading could be exceeded for a coupler slack of
50mm and 75mm on sharper curves, up to 400m radii.
A detailed study of the effect of steady in-train forces on wagon dynamics on curves
also was completed. Steady in-train forces were applied to a three wagon model
using VAMPIRE. Maximum and minimum values of wheel unloading and L/V ratio
were identified to demonstrate the level of vehicle stability for each scenario. The
results allowed the worse cases of wheel unloading and L/V ratio to be studied in
detail.
Probability density functions were constructed for the occurrence of longitudinal
forces and coupler angles for the Monto and North Coast Lines. Data was simulated
for a coupler slack of 25, 50 and 75mm and force characteristics were further
classified into the occurrences of impact and non-impact forces. These probability
density functions were analysed for each track section to investigate the effects of
coupler slack, track topography and gradient on wagon dynamics. The possible
wagon instability in each of these scenarios was then assessed to give a measure of
the potential consequences of the event. Risk assessment techniques were used to
categorise levels of risk based on the consequences and likelihood of each event. It
was found that for the train configuration simulated, the Monto Line has a higher
derailment risk than the North Coast Line for many of the scenarios studies in this
thesis. For a coupler slack of 25mm no derailment risks were identified, 50mm
coupler slack derailment risks were only identified on the Monto track and the
majority of derailment risks were identified for a 75mm coupler slack.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Derailment</field><field name="subject">risk assessment</field><field name="subject">longitudinal train dynamics</field><field name="identifier">http://library-resources.cqu.edu.au./thesis/adt-QCQU/public/adt-QCQU20060720.100637</field></doc><doc><field name="title">'FIGHTING IN THE GRAND CAUSE':A HISTORY OF THE TRADE UNION MOVEMENT IN ROCKHAMPTON 1907 &#150; 1957</field><field name="creator">Webster, Barbara Grace</field><field name="description">Research of a wide range of primary sources informs this work, including hitherto unstudied local union records, oral testimony, contemporary newspapers, government and employer reports.

A central premise of this study is that the rapid environmental transformation of New Zealand stimulated widespread anxieties and reforms within settler society. These anxieties focussed as much on the changes already begun as on apprehensions of the results of these changes. Applying the concept of environmental anxiety to settler New Zealand expands understandings about colonial culture and its environmental history. It moves debate beyond simple narratives of colonial environmental destruction. Instead, this thesis highlights the ambiguities and complexities of colonial views of the natural world. This thesis points to the insecurities behind seeming Victorian confidence, even arrogance, in the ability of science and technology to bring constant material improvement. Europeans recognised that modern living brought material advantages but that the rapid environmental changes that underpinned these improvements also brought and threatened to bring unwanted outcomes.
	A diverse range of settlers worried about the effects of environmental changes. Individuals, institutions, committees, councils, doctors, scientists, artists, governments, engineers and politicians expressed environmental anxieties of one kind or another. Some farmers, politicians and scientists held that deforestation decreased rainfall but increased temperatures. Other scientists and politicians feared that it brought devastating floods and soil erosion. Some Maori, travellers, politicians and scientists held that it destabilised sand that would inundate fertile fields. Councillors, engineers and doctors constantly debated ways of improving the healthiness of towns and cities, areas seen as particularly dangerous places in which to live. Doctors&#65533; and settlers&#65533; anxieties focused on the effects of New Zealand&#65533;s climate on health and racial development. The impact of environmental change on the healthiness of certain areas, as well as the role played by humans in climate change, also provoked lively discussion.
	The effects of these anxieties are evident in some of the land policies, artworks, legislation, parliamentary and scientific debates, and writings of this period. Settlers believed curbing pollution, laying out parks, planting trees and restricting the construction of unhealthy properties improved living conditions in cities. Some scientists and politicians thought setting aside forest &#65533;climate reserves&#65533; in highland areas, tree-planting legislation and sustainable forestry practices prevented flooding and climate change. Individuals and authorities also established sanatoria and spas in particularly healthy spots, such as at the seaside and in high, dry places.
	In investigating these topics, this thesis expands the discipline of environmental history, bringing to light the importance of studying urban environments, aesthetics, climate change, desertification and health. It expands the largely &#65533;national&#65533; narratives of New Zealand&#65533;s environmental histories by acknowledging that local environments, events and attitudes as well as global environments, events and attitudes shaped anxieties and policies. Global ideas, often operating at a local level, played a role in reinforcing and providing solutions to New Zealand&#65533;s environmental anxieties. This thesis also acknowledges the on-going significance of Christianity in under-girding ideas about improvement and environmental protection. Most significantly, perhaps, this study underlines both that many settlers displayed an emotional attachment to the New Zealand environment and that most colonists wanted to ensure the long-term productivity of its lands.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">New Zealand history</field><field name="subject">settlers</field><field name="subject">environment</field><field name="subject">climate</field><field name="subject">conservation</field><field name="subject">health</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20051020.183413</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Anatomy of microvenous valves of normal and venous ulcerated lower limbs</field><field name="creator">Phillips, Mark N.</field><field name="description">Venous disease is a very common disease that affects millions of people worldwide. While some of the factors that cause the development of varicose veins are well understood, the aetiology of venous ulceration is poorly understood. It has been demonstrated that venous valve failure in the large veins is an important factor leading to the development of varicose veins, however whether similar valves exist in the very small superficial veins of the human leg, and what role these valves may have in venous disease, is unknown. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to: 1. Identify whether venous valves are present in the very small superficial veins of the human leg, and if they are present, 2. Describe the density, size distribution, morphology, and regional distribution of these microvenous valves in &#65533;normal&#65533; cadaveric legs 3. Compare the &#65533;normal&#65533; microvenous valves from cadaveric tissue with microvenous valves from pathologic legs with chronic venous disease, to answer the hypothesis that individuals that develop venous ulceration have fewer microvenous valves than the normal population. In order to examine microvenous valves, two main methods have been utilised, E12 sheet plastination and vascular casting. These methods in combination provide valuable insights into the anatomy of microvenous channels, and allow examination and quantification of the venous valves. Using several techniques, this study has shown that microvenous valves are present within the very small veins of the superficial tissue of the human leg. These microvalves have been shown to be most prevalent in the smallest of the veins, down to 18[mu]m in diameter. Approximately 60% of the valves were found to be associated with tributaries. The gaiter region was demonstrated to contain the lowest number and density of microvenous valves, significantly less that the upper or mid calf regions. In addition, the gaiter region was found to have a much lower proportion of microvalves in the most superficial veins, when compared with the other regions examined. Contrary to our hypothesis, the number and density of microvalves in venous diseased legs was not different to that of normal legs. Similarly, the size and regional distributions were also not different. However, the microvalves from the venous diseased legs were significantly stretched and incompetent, allowing retrograde flow from the large veins through to the dermal capillaries. In conclusion, this study has shown that venous valves are present in the smallest of the superficial veins of the human leg, and that their density and distribution is not different between normal and venous diseased individuals. However, the microvalves from the diseased legs were incompetent and allowed retrograde flow. The role that these valves play in normal and pathological circulation is unclear, and warrants further examination.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">veins</field><field name="subject">diseases</field><field name="subject">venuous valves</field><field name="subject">ulcers</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20060523.142055</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Te Ao o te whaiko&#772;rero</field><field name="creator">Rewi, Poia</field><field name="description">Te Ao o te Whaiko&#772;rero, the &#65533;world of Ma&#772;ori oratory&#65533;, explores the complexity of &#770;Ma&#772;ori oratory, both past and present. What makes whaiko&#772;rero more than merely a theatrical speech is the origin and function of the various components, the rites associated with the selection and qualification of its exponents, and its delivery. This thesis delves into the underlying philosophies inherent in whaiko&#772;rero which impact on, and are influenced by, a diverse range of systems within the Ma&#772;ori world, its culture, etiquette, and belief system. We must also recognise the effect of colonisation and urbanisation on Ma&#772;ori practices. Whaiko&#772;rero is tragically undermined by some of its &#65533;performers&#65533; and observers alike, and possibly, through ignorance, arrogance and complacency, a sense of disregard has developed about its true value. The effect of this is whaiko&#772;rero of inferior quality. With this in mind, this thesis expounds the &#65533;underlying philosophies&#65533; of whaiko&#772;rero through both oral and literary sources, as well as objective and subjective discussion.
	The chapters illustrate the inter-tribal, intra-tribal, and individual variations which make each delivery of whaiko&#772;rero unique. The thesis begins with the origin of whaiko&#772;rero, after which modes of learning and the acquisition of whaiko&#772;rero are discussed. This provides the basis to discuss the locations where whaiko&#772;rero takes place and who is permitted to deliver whaiko&#772;rero. Having designated the people to deliver whaiko&#772;rero and their &#65533;space&#65533; for delivery there is an exploration of the speaker, and the attributes which qualify a particular individual, or the type of delivery that is acceptable. The issue of &#65533;quality&#65533;, or lack of it, is of paramount importance in terms of the mana of the individual performer, and the people (s)he represents. The range of information discussed up to this point is historical and tracks the evolution of whaiko&#772;rero to the present; the conclusion, therefore, also addresses some of the issues raised which are potentially challenging in regard to current adherence to custom and etiquette. This opens the window into the future of whaiko&#772;rero, and what adaptations may lie ahead. Perhaps with broader, and more in-depth discussion, and in particular, the explanation of the diversity of whaiko&#772;rero, this thesis will provide a) a means by which the spirit of older whaiko&#772;rero can be reinvested in the modern context by current and potential orators, and b) raise the awareness of speakers whereby they themselves can seek excellence in their own whaiko&#772;rero. Perhaps with an invigorated approach to both the delivery, observance, and a more informed appreciation of whaiko&#772;rero, there will be a resurgence of excellence in whaiko&#772;rero.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">Maori language</field><field name="subject">Maori speeches</field><field name="subject">Spoken Maori</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20060705.121343</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Supramolecular transition metal architectures</field><field name="creator">Cordes, David B.</field><field name="description">This thesis describes the investigation of the coordination and supramolecular chemistry of three different types of pyridine-containing ligand with a selection of Ag(I), Cu(I), Cu(II) and Cd(II) salts. The ligand types are flexible and four-armed, rigid and four-armed and bent with two rigid arms. All the ligands also display the ability to form additional supramolecular interactions.
	Chapter one introduces supramolecular chemistry and crystal engineering and covers background on several areas of current interest in these fields. Network structures, both coordination polymers and hydrogen-bonded systems, are discussed and topological analysis as a method of describing and comparing network structures is introduced. An outline of the ligand design, choice of transition metals and anions is given.
	Chapter two provides a review of flexible four-armed pyridine-containing ligands and their use in coordination chemistry. The synthesis and characterisation of three flexible four-armed ligands 1,2,4,5-tetrakis(2-pyridylmethyl-sulfanylmethyl)benzene (2tet), 1,2,4,5-tetrakis(3-pyridylmethyl-sulfanylmethyl)benzene (3tet) and 1,2,4,5-tetrakis(4-pyridylmethyl-sulfanylmethyl)benzene (4tet) are given. The synthesis and characterisation of the Ag(I), Cu(II) and Cd(II) complexes formed with these three ligands are also given. The complex of [Cd(2tet)(NO&#8323;)&#8324;] was structurally characterised by X-ray diffraction and was found to be a discrete species. The complexes {[Ag&#8322;(3tet)](ClO&#8324;)&#8322;}n&#818;, {[Ag&#8322;(3tet)](PF&#8326;)&#8322;}n&#818;, {[Ag&#8322;(3tet)](CF&#8323;CO&#8322;)&#8322;}n&#818;, {[Ag&#8322;(4tet)]-(ClO&#8324;)&#8322;&#65533;2MeCN&#65533;2CHCl&#8323;}n&#818;, {[Ag&#8322;(4tet)](PF&#8326;)&#8322;&#65533;6MeCN}n&#818; and {[Ag&#8322;(4tet)](ClO&#8324;)&#8322;-&#65533;3H&#8322;O}n&#818; were likewise structurally characterised by X-ray diffraction. All these complexes were three-dimensional coordination polymers. A comparison of the seven structures is given at the end of the chapter.
	Chapter three reviews rigid four-armed pyridine-containing ligands and their use in coordination chemistry. The preparation of the rigid four-armed ligand 2,3,4,5-tetrakis(4-pyridyl)thiophene (pyth) is given. The synthesis and characterisation of the Ag(I), Cu(I) and Cd(II) complexes formed with this ligand are also given. The complexes [Ag(pyth)](BF&#8324;)&#65533;3MeCN&#65533;CH&#8322;Cl&#8322;}n&#818;, [Ag(pyth)](PF&#8326;)&#65533;MeCN&#65533;CH&#8322;Cl&#8322;}n&#818;, [Ag(pyth)]-(CF&#8323;SO&#8323;)&#65533;2MeCN&#65533;CH&#8322;Cl&#8322;}n&#818;, [Cu(pyth)](PF&#8326;)&#65533;MeCN&#65533;CH&#8322;Cl&#8322;}n&#818; and [(Cu&#8322;I&#8322;)(pyth)]-(BF&#8324;)&#65533;1/2CH&#8322;Cl&#8322;&#65533;H&#8322;O}n&#818; were structurally characterised by X-ray diffraction. The complex with CuI was a two-dimensional coordination polymer, and the other four complexes were three-dimensional coordination polymers. A comparison of the five structures is given at the end of the chapter.
	Chapter four begins with a review of rigid angular bridging ligands and their use in coordination and supramolecular chemistry. The preparation of the ligand bis(4-pyridyl)amine (bpa) is given. The structural arrangement of bpa in the solid state was determined by X-ray diffraction. Complexes of Ag(I), Cu(I), Cu(II) and Cd(II) formed with this ligand were synthesised and characterised. The complexes {[Ag(bpa)(MeCN)](CF&#8323;SO&#8323;)}n&#818;, {[Ag(bpa)](PF&#8326;)&#65533;MeCN}n&#818;, {[Ag(bpa)](ClO&#8324;)-&#65533;2MeCN}n&#818;, {[Ag(bpa)](ClO&#8324;)}n&#818;, {[Ag(bpa)](NO&#8323;)}n&#818;, [(Cu&#8322;I&#8322;)(bpa)&#8322;]n&#818;, {[Cu(bpa)&#8322;Cl&#8322;]-&#65533;3DMF&#65533;3/2H&#8322;O}n&#818;, {[Cd(bpa)&#8322;(NO&#8323;)(H&#8322;O)](NO&#8323;)}n&#818;, {[Cd(bpa)&#8322;(SO&#8324;)(H&#8322;O)]&#65533;3H&#8322;O}n&#818;, [Cd(bpaH)&#8322;(SO&#8324;)&#8322;(H&#8322;O)&#8322;]&#65533;2MeCN and {[Cd(bpa)(SCN)&#8322;]&#65533;1/5iPrOH}n&#818; were structurally characterised by X-ray diffraction. All complexes with Ag(I) were one-dimensional coordination polymers, with two of them helical, the other three zigzag. Both complexes with Cu(I) and (II) were two-dimensional coordination polymers. One complex with CdSO&#8324; was discrete, with the bpa ligands mono-protonated, but all other three other Cd(II) complexes were three-dimensional coordination polymers. Seven of these complexes showed hydrogen-bonding interactions linking them together to form supramolecular structures of higher dimensionalities. A comparison of the twelve structures is given at the end of the chapter.

In South Westland, south of the Arawata River, however, several terranes converge onto the Alpine fault. Inherent anisotropies arising from the position of pre-existing fault structures, lithological contacts and rheological heterogeneities within these give rise to an atypically diffuse and complex zone, the overall geometry of which resembles a regional scale transpressive flower structure.
	The flower structure is a broad deformation zone 60 km in length extending approximately 7 km from the Alpine fault to its eastern limit, the Dun Mountain Ophiolite Belt. Integral parts of the structure are the Hollyford Fault System and the Livingstone Fault System. The area is characterised by an array of left-stepping, subparallel faults with an average 060&#65533; strike linked by 020&#65533; striking structures. All fault traces offset Quaternary features. Fractions of the total interplate slip are partitioned across the reactivated structures. Additionally, kinematic indicators reveal partitioning of strike-slip and oblique/dip-slip deformation across the related secondary fault zones.
	The behaviour of the plate boundary zone in South Westland is fundamentally controlled by reactivation of the Hollyford Fault System and the Livingstone Fault System which partition slip away from the Alpine fault. As a consequence, the eastward transferral of slip onto the curved geometry of the converging fault systems has ultimately created a left-stepping contractional regime, the equivalent of a restraining bend in the plate boundary zone. The competent Dun Mountain Ophiolite Belt controls the geometry and evolution of the reactivated structures. It also acts as an indenter and imposes additional boundary conditions adding to the shortening component in the region and the onset of complex transpressional strain patterns.
	The geometry and kinematics of the flower structure in the upper crust is mimicked in the ductile mid to lower crust. Upper greenschist facies mylonites reveal a complex fold pattern developed in response to contemporaneous non-coaxial and coaxial deformation. The folding formed during a continuation of deformation associated with mylonitisation at depths within the fault system. The fact that strain localisation and transpressive strain patterns in the brittle crust continue into the ductile zones suggests there is a feedback relationship between the two regimes.
	The reactivation of pre-existing structures and the influence of rheological factors are considered as first order factors controlling strain partitioning in the plate boundary zone. Recognition of local strain partitioning is important for assessing slip rates and earthquake recurrence. Similarly, the faults extend down below the seismogenic zone so that interaction of the different structures with each other may produce changes in fault behaviour which affects earthquake nucleation.
	Although the Alpine fault is a major structure in the South Island of New Zealand with over 400 km of dextral movement, the reactivated structures still exert a degree of control locally on the structure and kinematics of the plate boundary zone. Reactivation of inherent fault structures has important implications for the initiation of plate boundary faults and the alteration of the plate boundary geometry with evolving deformation.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">plate tectonics</field><field name="subject">rock deformation</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Westland</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20060705.150820</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Delusions : conceptual and phenomenological aspects</field><field name="creator">Mullen, Richard Steven</field><field name="description">Delusions can be reliably identified in clinical populations. However their definition has been a matter of controversy. Attributes that are commonly used to characterise delusions, such as falsity and excessive conviction, do not generally distinguish them from more ordinary beliefs. The convention that considers delusions as forms of belief obscures many of the important points of distinction from more ordinary beliefs.
	Conceptual review of the concept of bizarre delusions suggests that delusions are distinguishable from other forms of belief by virtue of their individual bizarreness. That is, delusions depart from what might be the understandable beliefs or experiences for a given individual. Departure from what is objectively possible or culturally sanctioned or expected are useful, but potentially misleading, proxies for individual bizarreness. Although individual bizarreness may be the key defining feature of delusional phenomena, bizarreness, however conceived, may not usefully distinguish different subtypes of delusion.
	The idea that delusions are best considered to be on a continuum with more ordinary beliefs is problematic. The continuum hypothesis depends on overemphasis on falsity and complete conviction as identifying characteristics of delusions. Both continuum and category approaches to delusions have utility that depends on the immediate purpose, but neither approach in itself can be presumed to show the greater verisimilitude.
	Overvalued ideas are another group of strongly held beliefs that may be false and idiosyncratic. Their relationship to delusions has been uncertain. It is argued that overvalued ideas and delusions are different kinds of phenomena, as overvalued ideas lack the individual bizarreness of delusions. A comparison of delusions in individuals with schizophrenia, with over-valued ideas in individuals with non-psychotic mental disorders, is reported. Several differences between delusions and over-valued ideas were identified. Over-valued ideas were associated with more gradual onset, greater preoccupation, and more concern about the opinions of others about the belief. Delusions were less plausible in their content and the deluded individuals often accounted for the origin of their delusion by referring to other psychotic experiences such as hallucinations. Conviction and insight were not found to differ across the two groups.
	Delusions are experiences that have many of the external characteristics of ordinary human belief. However overemphasis on these similarities results in neglect of important differences, and may lead to clinical error.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">delusions</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20060705.155942</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Pyridylacetylenes and their cobalt clusters; novel naphthalimide monomers and polymers</field><field name="creator">Dana, Bogden Hariton</field><field name="description">A series of 2,6- and 3,5-ethynylpyridyl compounds and their cobalt clusters have been prepared and analysed in Chapter 2, in order to study through-space and through-bond interactions between the ethynyl arms. Bidentate N- donor ligands, such as bipyridine and o-phenanthroline with alkyne functionality have been used extensively as building blocks for a wide range of molecular materials, but monodentate ethynylpyridyls have received less attention.
	The results showed that while there is no orbital restriction on a RC[triple bond]C-n-[pi]&#65533;cc-C[triple bond]CR through-bond interaction in 2,6-ethynylpyridyls, no significant interaction exists. Nevertheless, there are intramolecular interactions as manifested in the distortions which occur in the solid state structure of the compounds and the lability of the diphenylphosphine methane (dppm) moieties in the oxidised Co&#8322;(CO)&#8324;dppm species.
	Polymerisation by Sonogashira coupling between dibromo pyridines or diiodo ferrocene and ethynyl pyridines resulted in only oligomeric fractions that could be separated.
	The thesis also reports the synthesis and characterization of some novel naphthalimide monomers with acrylic and allyl headgroups. The naphthalimide moiety is substituted in the 4-position with various functionalities. This is presented in detail in Chapter 3 of the thesis. The monomers&#65533; structure is the following: [illustration omitted] wherein: A may be a polymerizable group (methacrylate or allyl), which includes a spacer entity (aliphatic or aromatic); B is selected from an ethenyl or ethynyl linked organometallic group, a halogen and/or an amine (i.e. bromo, ethynylferrocene, ethenylferrocene, trimethylsilylethynyl, nitro, piperidine and ethenylpiperidine).
	The acrylic monomers were synthesized by coupling 4-bromo-1,8-naphthalic anhydride with an amino alcohol to give an imide, which then was coupled with methacryloyl chloride to provide the methacrylate.
	Functionalization in the 4-position of the naphthalimide moieties was achieved by Sonogashira and Heck coupling reactions with for example ethynylferrocene, trimethylsilyl acetylene, vinylferrocene.
	For the allyl monomers synthesis, a reaction between allyl amine and 4-Bromo-naphthalic anhydride provided 4-bromo-naphthalimido allyl, which was then functionalized by further Sonogashira and Heck coupling reactions.
	The monomers were polymerised and copolymerised with other widely used comonomers, such as methyl methacrylate, methyl acrylate, styrene, vinyl carbazole and acrylonitrile. The polymerisation processes and the full analyses of the (co)polymers are described in Chapter 4.
	Free radical polymerisation, FRP, initiated by azo bisisobutyronitrile, AIBN at elevated temperature was the main technique employed for making the (co)polymers.
	Atom Transfer Radical Polymerisation, ATRP was conducted for some monomers although the results were inconclusive (the yields were low, under 50%, but the molecular weight distributions were quite narrow, PDI&#65533;s &lt;1.7).
	Heck coupling polymerisation was performed for the bromo- substituted methacrylic and allyl monomers and supplied colorful, well-defined polymeric materials, with low polymerisation degrees.
	All polymers were analyzed by HPLC, NMR, UV-VIS, IR, electrochemistry and fluorescence. The (co)polymers made by FRP had various molecular masses (Mn = 3000- 90.000), whereas the polydispersities were PDI = 1.4- 4.6.
	Most of the (co)polymers were fluorescent and had good thermal and electrochemical properties. Potential applications of the polymers have been suggested and relevant literature background in the field is provided in both Chapters 1 and 4.
	The monomers/ polymers are stable compounds (no special storage conditions required) and can act as good candidates for potential applications in light emitting devices, as resins/ binders for coating materials, in the dyes and pigment industry and also for manufacturing of conducting polymers and/or composite materials.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">polymers</field><field name="subject">radicals</field><field name="subject">electrochemical analysis</field><field name="subject">organocobalt compounds</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20060707.142806</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sheep mandibular animal models for dental implantology research</field><field name="creator">Duncan, Warwick John</field><field name="description">This inquiry investigated the suitability of the jaw of domestic sheep as an animal model for dental implantology research. Initially, parameters for osseous healing of critical size defects (CSD) in the sheep mandible were established. Pilot studies were conducted using machined-surface implants and a surgical protocol established for dental implant placement in ovine mandibular sites. Subsequent experiments considered the utility of this animal model for examination of techniques designed to enhance osseointegration. Hydroxyapatite-coated implants were compared with titanium plasma-sprayed (TPS) implants, either alone or combined with autogenous bone grafts or a bone graft/collagen vehicle loaded with transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-&#946;). Immunofluorescent bone labelling gave information on the mineral apposition rate (MAR). Implant survival and "acceptability" (likelihood of clinical success) were major output variables, along with histomorphometric analysis of percent bone-implant contact (%BIC) and percent peri-implant bone density (%density). Naturally-occurring "broken-mouth" periodontitis in sheep was identified as a potential confounder. Subsequent experiments considered implants with different surfaces. The model was also extended from a two-stage surgical protocol to include single-stage implants. The effect of pre-existing ovine peridontitis was also examined. A systematic review and meta-analysis of published animal implant experiments was conducted in order to validate the candidate sheep model.
	Major findings were as follows. The size of non-healing sheep mandibular unicortical CSD is &gt;12mm. Attempts to establish a chronic non-healing CSD were unsuccessful. The sheep diastema proved unsuitable for implant placement. The model was modified to a post-extraction protocol. Implant "acceptability" rates after 3 months integration in the sheep mandible (defined as implant survival with %BIC &gt;10%) ranged from 50% - 100% for different implant surface treatments and placement protocols. Histomorphometriic analyses revealed that %BIC ranged from 11 &#65533; 17% to 81 &#65533; 29 % for different titanium surfaces and up to 85 &#65533; 11% for hydroxyapatite surfaces. Implants with TGF-&#946; plus autogenous bone grafts had %BIC of 36 &#65533; 30% compared with 43 &#65533; 30% for implants with grafts alone. Bone per unit area (%density) adjacent to, but outside of the implant threads, ranged from 63 &#65533; 16% to 86 &#65533; 3% and was markedly lower for titanium plasma-sprayed surfaces and for one-stage implants. Within the implant threads, %density varied from 31 &#65533; 33% to 73.4 &#65533; 8.3%, and was markedly lower for machined titanium surfaces. Sheep periodontitis had little effect on the protocols investigated. The sheep mandibular model was found to be comparable to similar models in other species and merits further development.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">dental implants</field><field name="subject">mandible</field><field name="subject">sheep</field><field name="subject">animal models</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20060707.144214</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Adverse drug events and medication errors in a paediatric inpatient population</field><field name="creator">Kunac, Desir&#233;e L.</field><field name="description">Background. Medication-related patient injuries (adverse drug events, ADEs) are an important problem in all hospitalised populations; however, the potential for injury is reported to be greater in children than adults. Many ADEs are due to error and therefore could be prevented. Data regarding the risk factors (or predictors) for these events in paediatric inpatients is limited. It was hypothesised that "identification of risk factors for ADEs and medication errors in the paediatric inpatient setting will inform likely prevention strategies".
	Aims. To determine the frequency, nature and risk factors for ADEs and potential ADEs occurring in a paediatric inpatient population; to assess the vulnerable processes in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) medication use process; and to provide recommendations for the targeting of likely prevention strategies.
	Setting. A general paediatric ward (PW), postnatal ward (PNW) and NICU of a University- affiliated urban general hospital.
	Design. There were two study components: the medEVENT study which involved identification of actual ADEs and potential ADEs over a twelve week period, through prospective review of medical records, medication charts and administration records along with voluntary and solicited staff report and parent interview; and the FMEA study which used a proactive risk assessment technique, Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (FMEA), to rank all potential failures in the NICU medication use process according to risk.
	Results. In the MedEVENT study 3160 prescription episodes were reviewed (which represented 520 admissions, 3037 patient-days) and revealed a total of 67 ADEs and 77 potential ADEs. The greatest number of events occurred in NICU with very few events in the PNW. However, paediatric surgical admissions experienced the highest rate of ADEs per 1000 patient-days (80) as compared to medical (65) then NICU admissions (19). Over half of the ADEs were deemed preventable, 38 (57%), with the &#65533;more serious&#65533; ADEs more likely to be preventable than &#65533;not serious&#65533; ADEs. The impact on hospital resources was considerable with the cost attributed to extra bed days due to ADEs to be $NZD 50,000. Dosing errors were the most common type of error, particularly when prescribing and administering medications. Antibacterial and narcotic analgesics were commonly implicated, as was the intravenous route of administration. Few events were related to unlicensed use of medications.
	For ADEs, the major risk factors when analysed by admission, were greater medication exposure and increasing age; by prescription, were increasing age, oral route and narcotics and antibacterial agents; for paediatric ward admission, were increasing age and increased length of stay; and for NICU admission, no major risk factors emerged. For potential ADEs, the major risk factors when analysed by admission were greater medication exposure; by prescription, were junior prescriber, intravenous route, narcotics and antibacterials; for paediatric ward admission, were junior prescriber and narcotics; and for NICU admission were antibacterials, electrolytes and umbilical venous catheter administration. Neither ADEs nor potential ADEs were associated with unlicensed use of medicines or high alert status drugs.
	The FMEA study identified 72 potential failures in the NICU medication use process with 193 associated causes and effects. Multiple failures were possible in the process of &#65533;prescribing medication&#65533; and in the process of &#65533;preparation of medication for administration&#65533;. The highest ranking issues were found to occur at the administration stage. Common potential failures related to errors in the dose, timing of administration, infusion pump settings and route of administration.
	Conclusions. Analysis of the risk factors of ADEs and potential ADEs found that the most vulnerable processes were when prescribing and when preparing a medicine for administration; especially when involving narcotic and antibacterial agents and for children with greater medication exposure Strategies that selectively target these high risk areas are therefore likely to have the greatest impact on preventing drug-related injuries in hospitalised children.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">pediatric pharmacology</field><field name="subject">chemotherapy</field><field name="subject">side effects of drugs</field><field name="subject">medication errors</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20060707.161220</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The acoustic behaviour of resident bottlenose dolphins in Fiordland, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Boisseau, Oliver</field><field name="description">The bottlenose dolphin Tursiops truncatus is an extremely well-studied species. We have an extensive knowledge of certain aspects of their vocal behaviour, particularly from captive contexts. Bottlenose dolphins produce a rich tapestry of vocalisations, however, which have historically received minimal attention. Resident groups of bottlenose dolphins frequent the waterways of Fiordland in southwest New Zealand. These deep, sheltered fiords are ideally suited for acoustic studies. 
This thesis presents the first detailed study of bottlenose dolphin acoustics in New Zealand. Both narrowband and broadband systems were used to record the vocalisations of two resident groups. Effort was distributed evenly over three years for both Doubtful Sound and Milford Sound. From 875 recordings, I proposed a repertoire of 15 discrete calls. These categories were subsequently compared using parameters measured from almost 2000 individual vocalisations. Various multivariate techniques revealed some redundancy in the proposed repertoire, and it was subsequently reduced to 12 calls. 
The 12 call repertoire was compared between the potentially interbreeding populations of Doubtful Sound and Milford Sound. Fiord-specificity was revealed for many of the calls, particularly the sequenced calls and whistles. These differences suggest bottlenose dolphins use dialects, in keeping with studies of killer whales and sperm whales. As Fiordland dolphins are out of sight for 90% of the time, acoustic techniques allow inference in to subsurface behaviour. I investigated sequential relationships among sounds and between sounds and behaviours. Many calls were strongly implicated in social interactions. The vocalisations ratchet, orca and the sequenced calls were associated with periods of conflict. A number of the click-based calls were linked to diving and presumed foraging events. 
Inference on the functional significance of sounds allowed an interpretation of habitat use.

In dominance hierarchies individuals with the greatest competitive ability will occupy prime locations during optimal periods to increase efficiency in gathering a resource. Subdominant individuals with low competitive abilities may be forced to reside in habitats of poor quality relative to dominant individuals. In this study I examined the long term patterns of giant kokopu distribution, movement, growth, habitat use, and social interaction between fish in relation to invertebrate drift (food supply). 
 The habitat quality and abundance of food along a one km section of Alex&#65533;s Creek was monitored for a two year period. Though the physical structure of Alex&#65533;s Creek was relatively homogenous there were significant spatial differences in the density of drifting invertebrates sampled between riffles and pools over this long temporal period. In general, more drifting invertebrates were sampled in riffles of relatively long length and area. 
 Within Alex&#65533;s Creek the distribution of giant kokopu, Galaxias argenteus, was determined by patchy distributions of food supply, specific physical factors of pools, and interactions between fish in dominance hierarchies. Over the 20 month study period, the most important biotic factor determining fish biomass was the total number of drifting invertebrates within pools while the most important abiotic factor determining fish abundances within pools was the pool size (surface area). The growth rate of individual fish correspondingly varied between fish residing within pools of different quality. Growth rates were higher for individual fish residing in pools with a relatively high density of drifting invertebrates. 
 The differences in individual growth rates of giant kokopu may determine when fish leave a particular habitat patch (pool) and move to a new one. Fish that moved had lower growth rates (before moving) than fish that remained resident within home pools. Overall the movement of giant kokopu within Alex&#65533;s Creek was very restricted due to a relatively consistent distribution of food, however there were differences in the mobility of giant kokopu among different social ranks. The most dominant fish in pools were largely sedentary while fish ranked directly below fish 1 (i.e. fish 2 and 3 in social hierarchies) were relatively mobile. 
 The ability of dominant fish to exclude subdominant fish from the most preferred feeding positions during optimal feeding times had consequences for overall giant kokopu activity. Under normal food supply conditions dominant fish were predominantly nocturnal and maintained large home ranges at night. Conversely subdominant fish occupied large home ranges by day, but were generally not observed at night. When the food supply was limited the utilization of pools was determined by social rank. Dominant fish from each pool increased daytime activity, home range size, aggressiveness, and the capture of food items offered by day while simultaneously reducing the spatial and temporal activity and habitat use of subdominant fish. These results indicate that behavioral changes in large dominant fish influence and reduce the amount of resources available to subdominant fish.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Giant kokopu</field><field name="subject">geographical distribution</field><field name="subject">food</field><field name="subject">growth</field><field name="subject">behaviour</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20060728.142904</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterisation of an 84 kb linear plasmid that encodes DDE cometabolism in Terrabacter sp. strain DDE-1</field><field name="creator">Shirley, Matt</field><field name="description">DDT, an extremely widely used organochlorine pesticide, was banned in most developed countries more than 30 years ago. However, DDT residues, including 1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis(4-chlorophenyl)ethylene (DDE), still persist in the environment and have been identified as priority pollutants due to their toxicity and their ability to bioaccumulate and biomagnify in the food chain. In particular, DDE was long believed to be &amp;quotenon-biodegradable&amp;quote, however some microorganisms have now been isolated that are able to metabolise DDE in pure culture. Terrabacter sp. strain DDE-1 was enriched from a DDT-contaminated agricultural soil from the Canterbury plains and is able to metabolise DDE to 4-chlorobenzoic acid when induced with biphenyl. The primary objective of this study was to identify the gene(s) responsible for Terrabacter sp. strain DDE-1&#65533;s ability to metabolise DDE and, in particular, to investigate the hypothesis that DDE-1 degrades DDE cometabolically via a biphenyl degradation pathway. Catabolism of biphenyl by strain DDE-1 was demonstrated, and a biphenyl degradation (bph) gene cluster containing bphDA1A2A3A4BCST genes was identified. The bphDA1A2A3A4BC genes are predicted to encode a biphenyl degradation upper pathway for the degradation of biphenyl to benzoate and cis-2-hydroxypenta-2,4-dienoate and the bphST genes are predicted to encode a two-component signal transduction system involved in regulation of biphenyl catabolism. The bph gene cluster was found to be located on a linear plasmid, designated pBPH1. A plasmid-cured strain (MJ-2) was unable to catabolise both biphenyl and DDE, supporting the hypothesis that strain DDE-1 degrades DDE cometabolically via the biphenyl degradation pathway. Furthermore, preliminary evidence from DDE overlayer agar plate assays suggested that Pseudomonas aeruginosa carrying the strain DDE-1 bphA1A2A3A4BC genes is able to catabolise DDE when grown in the presence of biphenyl. 
 A second objective of this study was to characterise pBPH1. The complete 84,054-bp sequence of the plasmid was determined. Annotation of the DNA sequence data revealed seventy-six ORFs predicted to encode proteins, four pseudogenes, and ten gene fragments. Putative functions were assigned to forty-two of the ORF and pseudogenes. Besides biphenyl catabolism, the major functional classes of the predicted proteins were transposition, regulation, heavy metal transport/resistance, and plasmid maintenance and replication. It was shown that pBPH1 has the terminal structural features of an actinomycete invertron, including terminal proteins and terminal inverted repeats (TIRs). This is the first report detailing the nucleotide sequence and characterisation of a (linear) plasmid from the genus Terrabacter.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">DDT (insecticide)</field><field name="subject">persistent pollutants</field><field name="subject">plasmids</field><field name="subject">organochlorine compounds</field><field name="subject">chlorohydrocarbons</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20060804.094902</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The influence of a back-support harness on the three dimensional kinematics and electromyography of the trunk in sheep shearers : implications for injury prevention</field><field name="creator">Schneiders, Anthony G.</field><field name="description">The occupation of sheep-shearing is classified as heavy to very-heavy physical work requiring a high level of energy expenditure while performing a repetitive task in a predominantly sustained trunk flexion posture. The task is further complicated by unpredictable animal behaviour. Shearing is considered to carry a high risk of injury particularly to the lumbar spine and epidemiological studies have demonstrated that the prevalence of low back pain (LBP) in shearers is high relative to other occupations. The emergence of a commercial shearing-aid (Warrie Back-Aid TM) that is purported to decrease loading on the spine, reduce injury rate and alleviate symptoms of spinal origin has been welcomed by many sectors of the wool-harvesting industry. However, the precise biomechanical influence of the Warrie Back-Aid TM (WBA) on the sheep-shearing task has not been quantified. 
 The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of the WBA on three-dimensional kinematics and electromyography of the trunk for 12 experienced shearers during the occupational task of sheep-shearing. 
 Sheep-shearing is a highly patterned process comprised of specific interlinked phases. Nine distinct phases of the shearing-task where the harness was worn during the removal of the sheep&#65533;s fleece were investigated. The study used an opto-electronic motion analysis system and rigid body dynamic modelling. The shearer&#65533;s trunk and pelvis were considered as a series of three coupled rigid segments; pelvis, lumbar, and thorax with four passive retro-reflective markers defining each segment. The kinematic variables of angular displacement, velocity and acceleration at the thoraco-lumbar and lumbo-pelvic joint centres were calculated for each shearer while shearing with and without the WBA. An eight channel sEMG telemetry system was used to simultaneous record activity in four pairs of trunk muscles. Temporal analysis of the sEMG signal gave information on the duration and relative intensity of trunk muscle activity. 
 The results demonstrated that the task of sheep-shearing required endurance-based muscle activity and the adoption of quasi-static posturing combined with complex asymmetrical trunk motion for extensive periods of the task time. There was considerable variability in the trunk motion of individual shearers despite the pattern-taught and repeatable nature of the shearing task. The introduction of the WBA had no effect on the time taken to shear or trunk kinematics however it resulted in reductions in muscular activity of the trunk extensors. When the complete shearing task was analysed there was a statistically significant reduction in mean intensity of muscle activity for the left multifidus (p = 0.010), right multifidus (p = 0.001), right iliocostalis (p = 0.004) and right longissimus (p = 0.002) when the WBA was used. A reduction in muscular activity of the trunk extensors during the sheep-shearing task may result in a decrease in spinal loading, energy expenditure and muscular fatigue. 
 The clinical recommendation based on the biomechanical results of this and other studies is that the WBA should be incorporated into the practice of sheep-shearing to assist in the reduction of inherent risks associated with the shearing task. Prospective studies into the effect of the harness on LBP are required to endorse this recommendation.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sheep shearers</field><field name="subject">back injuries</field><field name="subject">injury prevention</field><field name="subject">Warrie Back-Aid</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20060803.160831</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterization of the eukaryotic translation termination sequence element</field><field name="creator">Cridge, Andrew Graham</field><field name="description">Termination of protein synthesis occurs in response to the translocation of a stop codon (UAA, UAG or UGA) into the A site of the ribosome. Unlike sense codons, stop signals in the mRNA are recognized by two classes of specialized proteins called release factors (RFs): the class I or decoding RF, which recognizes the stop codon and promotes peptidyl-tRNA hydrolysis and class II RF, a G-protein that promotes the dissociation of the decoding RF from the ribosome. The discovery that stop codons are decoded by a protein factor rather than a specific tRNA opened up the possibility that the signal for termination of protein synthesis might extend beyond the stop codon itself. Biochemical and genetic experiments in prokaryotes confirmed that bias in nucleotide usage around stop codons correlates with translation termination efficiency. The objective of the current investigation was to define the eukaryotic termination signal by determining the bias in the nucleotide sequence surrounding eukaryotic stop codons and to identify whether this was a determinant of translation termination efficiency. 
 Bioinformatic analysis of five diverse eukaryotic genomes was undertaken to identify potential eukaryotic translation termination signal elements. Significant nucleotide bias was identified both 5&#65533; and 3&#65533; of the stop codon in all the genomes investigated. Correlations were identified between nucleotide bias and gene expression levels, and between nucleotide bias and natural recoding sites predicting that nucleotides 5&#65533; and 3&#65533; of the stop codon affect termination efficiency. These correlations were common to all organisms investigated and suggested the existence of a eukaryotic termination signal. 
 Termination signals identified from the bioinformatic analysis were assayed to determine the efficiency of termination in an in vitro dual luciferase reporter assay. Results indicated that nucleotides both 5&#65533; and 3&#65533; of the stop codon could significantly alter termination signal efficiency, although readthrough did not vary by greater than 1%. The effect of nucleotides 3&#65533; to the stop codon on termination efficiency was investigated further in mammalian cultured cells using the dual luciferase reporter assay. Results showed a significant relationship between the identity of these nucleotides and observed termination efficiencies with nucleotides at positions +4 and +8 giving the strongest correlation. Termination sequence elements of the form UGA CUN NCN mediated up to 5% readthrough in cultured cells. 
 Investigations into the underlying mechanisms that were responsible for the variation in termination efficiency were also undertaken. Co-transfection of specific suppressor tRNAs enhanced but did not change the pattern of observed termination efficiency, indicating that the mechanisms mediated by the termination signal element was not mediated through suppressor tRNA binding. Alignments of 18S rRNA sequences indicated potential extensive interactions between the rRNA and the mRNA termination signal element. Experiments that assessed the effect of eRF1 levels on termination at inefficient termination signals in vitro revealed that increased levels of eRF1 could improve termination efficiency. 
 These results indicate that, as in prokaryotes, specific nucleotides beyond the stop codon modulate translation termination efficiency in eukaryotes, and that the translation termination signal should be considered a sequence element.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Eukaryotic cells</field><field name="subject">protein synthesis</field><field name="subject">RNA protein interactions</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20060804.095722</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Host interactions with Pseudomonas aeruginosa : a proteomic approach</field><field name="creator">Upritchard, Hamish Graeme</field><field name="description">Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic bacterial pathogen associated with severe nosocomial infections in immunocompromised hosts and patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). During infection the bacteria secrete proteins that are essential to the infection process. Several of these virulence-associated proteins have been identified using genetic methods. The aim of this research, using a proteomic approach, was to identify novel extracellular proteins that are secreted by P. aeruginosa during infection of a CF patient. 
 Extracellular proteins from P. aeruginosa strain PAO1 grown in vitro were separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE). The humoral response of chronically infected CF patients to the separated proteins was elucidated using western blotting. Growth phase, cell population and iron limitation were identified as important regulators of the extracellular proteome. The number of extracellular proteins significantly increased upon entry into stationary phase, as did the number of proteins detected by CF patient sera. The detection of several known quorum-controlled proteins by patient sera indicated the importance of this regulatory mechanism during infection. In iron-limiting medium, the proportion of proteins detected by CF patient sera significantly increased compared to extracellular proteins from cells grown in iron-replete conditions. Proteomic analysis of a PAO1 pvdS mutant strain showed that PvdS (an iron-regulated alternative sigma factor) directs production of many extracellular proteins made during infection of a CF patient. Examination of extracellular proteins from a second strain, PA4, indicated it had a shared set of extracellular proteins. The identities of selected proteins were determined and these included well-characterised extracellular virulence factors such as elastase (LasB). Also identified were proteins with a potential virulence role such as azurin (a copper containing redox protein), PA2939 (a likely aminopeptidase) and proteins with unknown functions. This study provides the first evidence for the production of these proteins during infection. In summary, the proteomics methodology developed here facilitated the rapid identification and enumeration of proteins secreted by P. aeruginosa during infection.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Pseudomonas aeruginosa</field><field name="subject">protein secretion</field><field name="subject">infection</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20060804.101030</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Vladimir Nabokov, 1938 : the artistic response to tyranny</field><field name="creator">Caulton, Andrew</field><field name="description">Nabokov is well known for writing numerous indictments of totalitarian tyranny, most notably Invitation to a Beheading (1935) and Bend Sinister (1947). However, my contention in this thesis is that Nabokov&#65533;s most sustained and most significant assault on totalitarian tyranny occurred in 1938. 
 The extent of Nabokov&#65533;s response to tyranny in 1938 is not immediately obvious. Some of Nabokov&#65533;s work of the year engages in an explicit assault on tyranny; however, in other cases the assault is oblique and in one instance cryptically concealed. In my thesis I examine each of the works of 1938, and set these against the political circumstances of the year, the tense atmosphere on the threshold of World War II. I find that all of the works of 1938, in one manner or another, respond to the political climate of the day; that Nabokov in 1938 made an unparalleled artistic response to tyranny in a uniquely ominous year. 
 The thesis is divided into two parts. Part 1 contains studies of each of the lesser works of 1938: chapter 5 of The Gift, "Tyrants Destroyed," The Waltz Invention, "The Visit to the Museum," and "Lik." These studies are inset into a chronological survey of the personal and political circumstances of Nabokov&#65533;s life in 1938. 
 Part 2 constitutes the most significant aspect of my thesis, an in-depth study of The Real Life of Sebastian Knight, Nabokov&#65533;s main work of 1938. The novel has been regarded as detached from the pre-war climate of the day; however, in an extensive new reading I find that the bright appearance of the novel is only a facade. My reading reveals a triadic, chess-problem-like structure to the novel, where the innocuous surface (the thesis) gives way to a cryptically concealed level of totalitarian themes (the antithesis), before the novel finally emerges onto a notional third level (the synthesis), the novel&#65533;s "solution." The Real Life of Sebastian Knight, I contend, represents the heart of Nabokov&#65533;s artistic response to tyranny in 1938. Through the triadic unfolding of the novel and the reader&#65533;s creative engagement with the text, Nabokov demonstrates that art itself triumphs over tyranny.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Vladimir Nabokov (1899-1977)</field><field name="subject">despotism in literature</field><field name="subject">politics in literature</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20060808.090922</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reclaiming the full story of human health : the ethical significance of complementary and alternative medicines</field><field name="creator">Clark-Grill, Monika Maria</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates the moral content of illness ontologies in different healing systems, in particular biomedicine and homeopathy. It was motivated by the wish to gain a greater understanding of the possible meaning and ethical significance underlying the increasing popularity of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) in Western countries. CAM is an umbrella term for a diverse group of therapeutic approaches, indicating their marginalized status in relation to conventional, scientific medicine. However, despite their diversity most CAM share a common bond by subscribing to a holistic perspective on life, health and illness. It is for this reason that this thesis concentrates on the conceptual level. The subject is approached by making use of interview material from five homeopathic doctors from Austria. Their perspective on different aspects of non-conventional, as well as biomedical, practice and underlying theory provides the springboard for theoretical investigations. 
 The demand for scientific evidence of CAM is critically examined. The issue of increasing pluralism in health care is explored, along with its challenge of finding appropriate epistemological approaches for therapeutic systems that are based on different illness ontologies. The favored approach in this thesis is based on the recognition by medical historians that there are four basic illness axioms: "illness as loss of balance", "illness as disruption of interpersonal communication", "illness as a physical defect" and "illness as pathic creation". These axioms are matched respectively with four different epistemic pathways: the dialectical, the hermeneutical, the analytical and the phenomenological. 
 The interviewees considered the more humane quality of the doctor/patient relationship in their homeopathic practices to be due to the holistic premises of homeopathy, which place the subjective dimension of patients at their center. The difficulty of achieving informed consent in the commonly used sense in homeopathic practice was solved by engaging in a shared decision-making process. Life was explained by the interviewees in vitalistic terms. Although rejected by science, the notion of vitalism appears to hold significance for the public. Illness was always perceived as a multidimensional process and not as a purely physico-chemical dysfunction. It became evident that the holistic perspective takes account of the many dimensions of human illness, of which neither the conventional reductionist conception nor the dualistic mind/body approach are capable. However, the unmanageable complexity of holism poses a problem for therapeutic practice. A conceptual approach providing some structure for the holistic multidimensionality is found in the four illness axioms and in analogous observations by Aristotle. 
 It is concluded that there could be a connection between the increased popularity of CAM and their underlying holistic perspective, since this theoretical foundation allows the practitioner to address the patient in a whole-person way. At the same time the holistic perspective provides a much broader scope than biomedicine for patients to influence their health. The recognition that human multidimensionality needs to be appreciated at the level of illness ontology may also provide an impetus for bioethics to approach contemporary ethical challenges from a perspective of an ethics of the good life, instead of concerning itself predominantly with setting limits in the arena of technological medicine.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">alternative medicine</field><field name="subject">therapeutics</field><field name="subject">holistic medicine</field><field name="subject">medical ethics</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20060808.142253</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Genes that define the Nucleopolyhedrovirus of Epiphyas postvittana</field><field name="creator">Hyink, Otto</field><field name="description">The nucleopolyhedrovirus of Epiphyas postvittana (EppoMNPV) is being studied as a potential biological control agent for leafroller insects in New Zealand. The aims of this project were for the identification of putative genes that are unique to, variant in or missing from, the EppoMNPV genome and the subsequent analysis of at least one of these genes. The purpose of this was to identify and characterise genes potentially involved in the specific host range and virulence of EppoMNPV. This was achieved in two steps. Three genome regions lacking linearity between EppoMNPV and the closely related OpMNPV were previously identified and the targeted sequencing of these three regions was the first aim of this project. The collation of the entire genome sequence of EppoMNPV and comparison to the genome sequences of 22 other baculoviruses completed the identification of genes that are unique to, variant in or missing from EppoMNPV. The EppoMNPV genome was found to be 118,584 bp in size encoding 136 putative proteins. A total of 29 genes were found to be common to all baculoviruses, while the lepidopteran baculoviruses share a total of 62 genes. The genome of EppoMNPV encodes four putative unique genes, the sequence of which offers no clues as to possible function. EppoMNPV lacks a homologue of the superoxide dismutase gene common to all other lepidopteran baculoviruses The EppoMNPV IE2 homologue was identified as a 311 amino acid protein with a truncation in the N-terminal region. We hypothesised that this truncation would lead to a loss of function, which could contribute to the virulence and/or host range of EppoMNPV For this reason, the characterisation of the EppoMNPV IE2 was taken up as the second part of this project. A comparative study between the AcMNPV and EppoMNPV IE2 proteins identified no differences in function between these two proteins in Sf21 cells. The EppoMNPV IE2 was capable of trans-activating three constitutive promoters and localised to discrete nuclear bodies. Cell cycle arrest was not achieved by either IE2 protein in our cell culture system. The role of four sequence motifs common to all IE2 proteins was studied with the aid of mutational analysis. Mutation of arginine and acidic rich sequences of EppoMNPV IE2 showed only a slight decrease in trans-activation activity while mutation of the RING-finger and coiled-coil motifs reduced trans-activation to less than half that of wild type IE2. Mutation of the coiled-coil motif resulted in reduced amounts of protein localising to discrete nuclear regions. A series of deletion mutants from the N- and C-termini of EppoMNPV IE2 identified that the C-terminal 111 amino acids of EppoMNPV IE2 was sufficient for nuclear targeting. Deletion of the C-terminal 19 amino acids resulted in an IE2 mutant completely defective in both localisation and transactivation. This demonstrates that localisation to discrete nuclear regions is essential for EppoMNPV IE2 to act as a transactivator.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Epiphyas postvittana</field><field name="subject">leafrollers</field><field name="subject">biological control systems</field><field name="subject">genetic regulation</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20060808.143556</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Shape modeling by swept space deformation</field><field name="creator">Angelidis, Alexis</field><field name="description">In Computer Graphics, in the context of shape modeling on a computer, a common characteristic of popular techniques is the possibility for the artist to operate on a shape by modifying directly the shape&#65533;s mathematical description. But with the constant increase of computing power, it has become increasingly realistic and effective to insert interfaces between the artist and the mathematics describing the shape. While in the future, shape descriptions are likely to be replaced with new ones, this should not affect the development of new and existing shape interfaces. Space deformation is a family of techniques that permits describing an interface independently from the description. Our thesis is that while space deformation techniques are used for solving a wide range of problems in Computer Graphics, they are missing a framework for the specific task of interactive shape modeling. We propose such a framework called sweepers, together with a set of related techniques for shape modeling. In sweepers, we define simultaneous-tools deformation, volume-preserving deformation, topology-changing deformation and animated deformation. Our swept-fluid technique introduces the idea that a deformation can be described as a fluid. In fact, the sweepers framework is not restrained to shape modeling and is also used to define a new fluid animation technique. Since the motion of a fluid can be considered locally as rigid, we define a formalism for handling conveniently rigid transformations. To display shapes, we propose a mesh update algorithm, a point-based shape description and a discrete implicit surface, and we have performed preliminary tests with inverse-raytracing. Finally, our technique called spherical-springs can be used to attach a texture to our shapes.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">computer graphics</field><field name="subject">computer vision</field><field name="subject">geometry</field><field name="subject">space deformation techniques</field><field name="subject">swept-fluid technique</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20060808.161349</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Measuring affective response to consumption using Rasch modelling</field><field name="creator">Ganglmair-Wooliscroft, Alexandra</field><field name="description">Satisfaction is a central concept in marketing. However in recent years, satisfaction has come under increasing criticism. Its ability to predict post-purchase behaviour has not been established and the importance of the word satisfaction to consumers has been questioned. Current satisfaction measures are inadequate, as they fail to discriminate between respondents, with the majority of respondents regularly endorsing the most positive answer category available. The limited discrimination of existing scales suggests that only a small part of the unfavourable/favourable evaluation, rather than the entire dimension is being measured. The overwhelming use of the most positive answer category, in traditional scales, illustrates that they fail to capture highly positive evaluations. 
 Affective Response to Consumption (ARC) is conceptualised as an extension to satisfaction. The conceptualisation shifts the emphasis from a scale relying on one, rather weak, emotional feeling -- satisfaction -- to a multitude of emotional feelings, including highly positive terms. 
 A scale measuring ARC is developed in an alternative measurement paradigm -- Rasch Modelling -- to the dominant paradigm for scale development in marketing -- Classical Test Theory. The characteristics of Rasch Modelling are particularly useful, when measuring a concept like ARC, that captures the entire dimension of unfavourable/favourable evaluations and includes terms of markedly different intensity.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Rasch model</field><field name="subject">satisfaction</field><field name="subject">consumption (economics)</field><field name="subject">marketing</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20060809.091317</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A framework for virtual artifacts : digital images as teaching tools in Classical art</field><field name="creator">Rountree, Janet</field><field name="description">This thesis explores the problem of how to present digital images of ancient artifacts in a manner that supports the task of visual analysis. 
 The real object presents the "truth": exact scale, colour, and fine details. An original work of art provides the viewer with the opportunity to react directly with the object, is closest to the impact intended by the artist, and provides a tangible physical link with the past. Digital images limit and alter the experience of a work of art (1) with regard to the amount of data available (resolution), and (2) through the interpretation of the object by the producers of the digital copy (mediation). 
 A new framework is developed to improve the understanding and presentation of virtual artifacts. This Fidelity-Mediation framework provides a continuum for considering the effects of design strategies on media used in teaching Classical arch&#65533;ology. Two small-scale experiments and follow-up interviews were undertaken to assess the usefulness of the Fidelity-Mediation framework as a descriptive model. During the experiments, quantitative analysis could detect no statistical difference in the effectiveness of different types of presentation (real object, VR object, and still digital images). 
 This is a surprising result as it might be expected that there is nothing like seeing the real thing. Digital images provide less visual integrity. However, the digitised artifacts make up for the loss of excitement and authenticity by providing the advantage of mediated focus. Digitised artifacts thus turn out to be useful, effective study tools in the analysis of Classical art. 
 Findings from this research are expected to generalise only to learning situations which support task orientation--situations conducive to developing personal skills and mastery--in contrast to performance orientation where the goal is to display performance relative to others.

A review of the widely researched strategy and SDM literature identified that managers use extensive information to support and improve strategic decisions and make informed decisions.

Even though web metrics can be a valuable tool for web businesses to inform strategic marketing decisions, and their collection might be less expensive and easier than offline measures, virtually no published research has combined web metrics and SDM concepts into one research project. 
 To address this gap in the literature, the thesis investigated the differences and commonalities of online and offline SDM process approaches, the use of web metrics categories for online SDM stages, and the issues encountered during that process through four research questions. A preliminary conceptual model based on the literature review was refined through preliminary research, which addressed the research questions and investigated the current state of web metrics. 
 After investigating various methodologies, a multi-stage qualitative methodology was selected. The use of qualitative methods represents a contribution to knowledge regarding methodological approaches to online research. Four stages within the online SDM process were shown to benefit from the use of web metrics: the setting of priorities, the setting of objectives, the pretest stage and the review stage. The results identified the similarity of online and offline SDM processes; demonstrated that Traffic, Transactions, Customer Feedback and Consumer Behaviour categories provide basic metrics used by most companies; identified the Environment, Technology, Business Results and Campaigns categories as supplementary categories that are applied according to the marketing objectives; and investigated the results based on different types of companies (website classification, channel focus, size and cluster association). Three clusters were identified that relate to the strategic importance of the website and web metrics. 
 Modifying the initial conceptual model, six issues were distinguished that affect the use of web metrics: the adoption and use of web metrics by managers; the integration of multiple sources of metrics; the establishment of industry benchmarks; data quality; the differences to offline measures; as well as resource constraints that interfere with the appropriate web metrics analysis. Links to offline marketing strategy literature and established business concepts were explored and explanations provided where the results confirmed or modified these concepts. 
 Using qualitative methods, the research assisted in building theory of web metrics and online SDM processes. The results show that offline theories apply to the online environment and conventional concepts provide guidance for online processes. Dynamic aspects of strategy relate to the online environment, and qualitative research methods appear suitable for online research.

Though much research in social psychology has focused on the need for positive self-esteem as an underlying motive, in the past 25 years, evidence for the role of self-esteem in intergroup discrimination has at best proved contradictory (see Long &amp; Spears, 1997; Rubin &amp; Hewstone, 1998). More recently, other motivational constructs for human behaviour have been proposed to play a part in intergroup discrimination (e.g. Abrams &amp; Hogg, 2001). This thesis focuses on the need to belong (or belongingness) as this has long been recognised as a basic human need (e.g. Horney, 1945) and recently, evidence has been provided to support this assumption (e.g. Baumeister &amp; Leary, 1995). Thus the present thesis argues that as a fundamental need, the need to belong (NTB) would be expected to play a role in intergroup discrimination. In support of this assumption, results from some empirical studies are also highly suggestive of a link between intergroup discrimination and the NTB (e.g. Marques &amp; Paez, 1994), though the current research programme is the first to explicitly examine this link. Seven experiments employing the same basic methodology were conducted to investigate the central hypothesis that engaging in intergroup discrimination decreases the NTB. Three experiments supported the hypothesis. Experiments 2 and 3 found that the NTB decreased for New Zealanders who engaged in intergroup discrimination and Experiment 7 found that members of a minimally socially important group showed a decrease in the NTB following intergroup discrimination when measured at a group level, but not at the personal level. 
 Experiment 1 (Chapter 5) investigated the central hypothesis utilizing the minimal group paradigm (MGP). Despite participants exhibiting intergroup discrimination when given the opportunity, there was no significant change in their reported NTB. Thus the results of this experiment did not support the central hypothesis. Experiment 2 (Chapter 6) investigated whether the central hypothesis would be supported if participants were members of a realistic and meaningful social group category (i.e. New Zealanders). Results from this experiment showed that those participants who exhibited intergroup discrimination did in fact show a significant decrease in their NTB. Experiment 3 (Chapter 7) sought to replicate these results and to control for self-esteem effects utilizing New Zealand participants. Again, results supported the central hypothesis and no effect was found for either global or collective self-esteem. To test whether this result would generalize to other social categories, Experiment 4 (Chapter 8) tested whether the NTB would be decreased after women participants engaged in intergroup discrimination. Results found there was no significant difference in the NTB between women who engaged in discrimination and those who did not. Thus the central hypothesis and the results from Experiment 2 and 3 were not supported. To then investigate whether social influence accounted for the contradictory results from Experiments 1-4, Experiment 5 (Chapter 9) required women to publicly or privately state their intergroup discrimination. No significant changes were found in the NTB (from pre- to post- allocation task) for either private or public responding conditions, whether women engaged in intergroup discrimination or not. It was then assessed whether the importance to participants of the social identity in question was a factor. Experiments 6a and 6b (Chapter 10; women and men respectively) compared the NTB of participants with low identification with their social group, to high identifying participants. For both women and men, no significant changes were found in the NTB from pre- to post-allocation task for either high or low identifiers, regardless of whether they engaged in intergroup discrimination. Thus the central hypothesis was again not supported. Finally in Experiment 7, the NTB measure was re-evaluated and items were changed to be more group-oriented, compared to the original more individually-oriented items. The procedure used for Experiment 1 (i.e. MGP) was employed for Experiment 7 (Chapter 11) with participants completing both the personal and group versions of the NTB scale. The results for the modified group NTB scale showed that for participants who engaged in intergroup discrimination, group NTB decreased significantly from pre- to post- allocation task, compared with no significant change for those participants who did not engage in discrimination. No effects were found for either control or experimental participants&#65533; responses on the original NTB scale. Thus the central hypothesis and the results from Experiments 2 and 3 were supported. Furthermore, as was found for earlier experiments, there was no effect of either personal or collective self-esteem on the results for Experiments 4- 7. Taken overall, these results indicate that there may be a relationship between intergroup discrimination and the need to belong and that this may be most appropriately assessed using a group level measure of the NTB. Moreover, these results cannot be explained on the basis of self-esteem. Results from Experiments 2 and 3 may also indicate that if the social group category is meaningful enough for the individual (e.g. nationality), significant changes for the NTB at the personal level may occur. Despite the limitations of the present research, these results indicate that the investigation of the relationship between intergroup discrimination and the need to belong may further elucidate the underlying nature of prejudice. A number of possible directions for future research are discussed.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">descrimination</field><field name="subject">prejudices</field><field name="subject">group identity</field><field name="subject">identity (psycological)</field><field name="subject">self-esteem</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20060809.134640</field></doc><doc><field name="title">"Did I say that ?" using videotapes to aid young children&#65533;s event recall</field><field name="creator">Anderson, Leigh Michelle</field><field name="description">The introduction of the Evidence Amendment Act (1989) in New Zealand allowed for children&#65533;s evidence to be videotaped and to be presented in court at a later time as evidence-in-chief. Typically, children see these tapes for the first time in court when they are required to be present for cross-examination, frequently months, or even years, after the evidence was recorded. From a theoretical perspective, allowing children to view a pre-recorded interview may be potentially beneficial, serving to remind the child of what was said at an earlier interview, and reactivating or &#65533;refreshing&#65533; the child&#65533;s memory of the event. It is also possible that viewing the videotape will have detrimental effects on children&#65533;s reports. For example, errors may be compounded when children see themselves make an error or complying with a suggestion on videotape. 
 In a series of five studies, the current thesis examined what effect, if any, viewing an earlier interview had on children&#65533;s subsequent reports about an event. In all studies presented, children took part in an event, and then were interviewed about that event 1-2 weeks later. That interview contained misinformation, which was introduced in questions. In Study 1, children watched their own videotaped interview 24 hours prior to being re-interviewed about an event in which they had participated seven months earlier. At Interview 2, the reports from these children were not very different from those of children who had no reminder, but they did report more information in free recall. 
 In Study 2, children viewed their pre-recorded interview immediately prior to Interview 2, rather than 24 hours prior, as in the first study. In addition, the delay between the event and Interview 2 was extended to 12 months. These changes were made to maximize any possible effects of the videotape as a reminder. In this study, there were greater differences between the reports of children who had, and who had not, viewed the earlier interview. These relative gains in information were not at the expense of accuracy. 
 Study 3 aimed to replicate the results of Study 2, using a larger sample. Due to circumstances beyond the Experimenter&#65533;s control, the participant number included in this study was reduced. The pattern of results in the present study was generally similar to the results observed in Study 2. 
 One group of participants participated in an additional event shortly before the end of the delay period between the interviews. This provided a unique opportunity to assess whether viewing a pre-recorded interview would assist with source monitoring, as the additional event was very similar to the first event. Study 4 examined this data. Results of this study indicated that the intervening visit interfered with the effectiveness of the pre-recorded interview as a memory aid. In addition, viewing the videotaped interview did not assist the children with source monitoring. 
 Study 5 examined whether the results from Studies 2 and 3 would generalise to a different event. The results suggested that a videotaped interview was much less effective with the different event. It is likely that this was because the event was less interactive, potentially less salient, and less familiar to the participants than the event used in the previous studies. 
 Study 6 combined the data from the previous five studies, in order to increase the statistical power. By doing this, it was anticipated that the consistent aspects of the results would become clearer, and that the inconsistent findings would be eliminated. Indeed, this study summarized the strengths of the earlier studies, and demonstrated that children&#65533;s reports at Interview 2 were enhanced when they viewed their videotape of Interview 1. This enhancement did not lead to an increased number of errors for the reminder group. 
 Taken together, these findings suggest that viewing a videotape of an earlier interview has some advantages and no detrimental effects on children&#65533;s subsequent reports. Errors spontaneously generated by the children tended to be minor, did not increase following exposure to the earlier interview, and were not repeated across the interviews. Watching a prior, videotaped interview had most benefit on increasing the information reported in free recall, and did not reduce accuracy. This is important, as free recall in interviews with children is typically accurate, but brief. Further, when asked direct questions, in some cases children who had seen a prior interview tended to be more likely to provide the correct answer. These findings are considered in the context of current legal reforms.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">memory in children</field><field name="subject">recollection (psychology)</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20060809.155338</field></doc><doc><field name="title">'Scenery and Chardonnay': a visitor perspective of the New Zealand winery experience</field><field name="creator">Mitchell, Richard D.</field><field name="description">It is widely recognised that the tourism experience involves pre-visit anticipation, travel to and from the site and post-visit reminiscence or recollection, yet to date few studies have explored the link between these elements. Winery visitation presents an excellent opportunity to explore these phases of the travel experience as wine is present pre-visit, on-site and post-visit. In 1999 this study set out to explore these links by surveying visitors to 33 New Zealand wineries and then tracking their behaviour six to eight months post-visit via a postal survey. 
 From an initial sample of 1,090, 636 follow-up surveys were distributed with 358 usable surveys returned. The on-site survey explored the pre-visit and on-site wine habits and winery visitation behaviour of respondents, while 97 semi-structured interviews were also undertaken in order to provide further detail on some aspects of the on-site visit. The follow-up survey included an exploration of the respondents&#65533; on-going purchasing and consumption of wine as well as experiential elements such as recollection of the visit, word-of-mouth behaviour and enduring levels of satisfaction. A number of a priori segmentation criteria drawn from wine consumer behaviour and wine tourism literature have been applied in the analysis of the data in order to provide a detailed discussion of the various elements of this multi-phased experience. 
 Many regional differences were observed in the demographic profile of respondents, while the age profile of male and female visitors were also significantly different. This has dispelled the myth of a 'typical winery visitor' put forward by many early wine tourism researchers and highlights the need for detailed market analysis for wineries and wine regions. Pre-visit wine habits and winery visitation behaviour were influenced by gender, age/generation and country of origin. However, the most significant influence was between different levels of wine knowledge. This highlights the importance of wine education and interpretation, which was also identified as an important part of the winery visit by many respondents. Examination of the on-site experience identified important regional differences in the nature of the winery experience and lead to the coining of the term touristic terroir to describe the nuances of the regional experience. Almost half of the respondents made a post-visit purchase, while there were moderately high levels of enduring satisfaction and high levels of word-of-mouth behaviour. Post-visit purchases were primarily influenced by taste, but experiential elements of the visit (including sharing the wine or winery experience with others, memory of the visit and the service received) were also moderately influential. 
 This study has provided an insight into wine tourism and the behaviour of the winery visitor. It is the first and, to date, only nationwide survey of winery visitors anywhere in the world and one of only a handful of tourism studies that have attempted to track the behaviour of respondents. It has identified important connections between the on-site experience, experiential aspects of the post-visit experience and the purchasing and consumption behaviour of winery visitors. It also provides a framework for the study of other areas of tourism including souvenir purchases, holiday photography, food and tourism and tourist behaviour more broadly.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">New Zealand wine industry</field><field name="subject">New Zealand wine districts</field><field name="subject">wineries</field><field name="subject">wine and wine making</field><field name="subject">travelers</field><field name="subject">tourism</field><field name="subject">psychological aspects</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20060810.150303</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ecological interactions between the trematode parasite Maritrema novaezealandensis (Microphallidae) and its intermediate hosts in the New Zealand intertidal soft-sediment community</field><field name="creator">Fredensborg, Brian Lund</field><field name="description">Most, if not all, animals will at some stage in their lives encounter parasites. Some of the most widespread and abundant parasites belong to the Class Trematoda. Trematodes often have a substantial negative impact on individual intermediate host ecology. In this thesis, I investigate ecological and evolutionary consequences of the interaction between the microphallid trematode, Maritrema novaezealandensis, and its intermediate snail and crustacean hosts. 
 Parasites often show a heterogeneous spatial distribution pattern in natural animal host populations. In this study, factors determining the spatial distribution of larval trematodes in Zeacumantus subcarinatus were investigated at two spatial scales (within and among bays). The distribution of shorebird definitive hosts explained a significant amount of the variation in the distribution of trematodes among bays. However, within a bay, other factors override the effect of bird distribution. 
 The influence of larval trematodes on reproduction, survival and population density of Z. subcarinatus was investigated using laboratory and field studies. In the laboratory, it was found that larval trematodes induce castration and mortality of Z. subcarinatus. The field study revealed that the local prevalence of trematodes had a significant negative effect on population density of Z. subcarinatus. 
 Through castration, trematodes act as strong selective agents on snail host life history. The effect of trematodes on life history characteristics (reproductive effort, juvenile growth, size at maturity and susceptibility to trematode infections) were investigated among natural populations of Z subcarinatus. Reproductive effort was not higher for uninfected females from populations where the risk of becoming infected was high. However, offspring from those populations were significantly larger, and laboratory-reared juveniles grew significantly faster than conspecifics from other populations. In addition, size at maturity was negatively correlated with trematode prevalence across snail populations. Z. subcarinatus thus adapts to a high local risk of trematode infection by reaching maturity early, thereby increasing the chance of reproducing. 
 The influence of M. novaezealandensis on the survial of the amphipod host, Paracalliope novizealandiae was examined using experimental infections and field observations. The experimental infections demonstrated that parasite-induced mortality was intensity-dependent. The number of M. novaezealandensis per amphipod was too low to significantly induce host mortality in the field. However, the transmission strategy of this parasite allows it to affect host populations during weather conditions ideal for trematode transmission. 
 Trematode strategies in the second intermediate host are important to the understanding of host-parasite co-evolution and the evolution of parasite life cycles. In this study, potential density-dependent effects at the metacercarial stage on size and fecundity of in vitro adult M. novaezealandensis was examined in both experimentally infected P. novizealandiae and naturally infected Macrophthalmus hirtipes. For this purpose, a method to excyst and cultivate M. novaezealandensis metacercariae to an egg producing stage, was developed. Naturally infected M. hirtipes also harboured larval stages of three other helminths. Crowding effects in the two crustacean hosts were expressed as a decreased volume and smaller egg production of in vitro adult M. novaezealandensis. In addition, interspecific interactions among parasite species were observed in crab hosts. 
 The work in this thesis provides evidence that M. novaezealandensis significantly and negatively affect intermediate host ecology. The heterogeneous distribution of trematodes causes differential effects among host populations with subsequent effects on the life history of snail hosts. In addition, this study demonstrates that parasites interact within their second intermediate host with possible implications for the way parasites exploit their hosts.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maritrema novaezealandensis</field><field name="subject">trematoda</field><field name="subject">host-parasite relationships</field><field name="subject">parasites</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20060810.154001</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The deep cervical fascia : an anatomical study</field><field name="creator">Nash, Lance Graham</field><field name="description">Current understanding concerning the human deep cervical fascia (DCF) differs between anatomists, surgeons, and radiologists. One reason has been the varying methodologies used to examine the DCF and the terminology assigned to each layer or potential space formed. Previous knowledge concerning the DCF originally came from cadaveric studies. However, such findings were highly subjective, reliant on the dissectionist&#65533;s skill with a scalpel. With the recent advent of radiological imaging and sheet plastination, there has been a re-examination of the fascial layers (investing, pretracheal, and prevertebral) that constitute the DCF. Although there is general consensus regarding the existence of the three layers, there is continuing conjecture over the concise anatomical description of these fascial structures. Recently, the investing (superficial) fascia, as a separate fibrous structure, has been questioned with a small number of plastination studies reporting its absence in the postereolateral regions of the neck. Within the suboccipital region (SOS) it is widely reported that the nuchal ligament, extending from the investing layer, directly connects with the spinal dura mater. However, a recent plastination study by Johnson et al. (2000b) found these fibres to dissipate in the SOS.The question remains as to what fibres directly communicate with the spinal dura? The fibrous connective bridge is reported in some clinical studies to originate from the rectus capitis posterior minor (RCPm) via the SOS. The origin of the connective fibrous bridge is essential in understanding the mechanism in the prevention of the phenomenon of 'infolding' and cervicogenic neck pain? Anteriorly, the investing fascia is regarded as a continuance of a 'fibrous collar' that encapsulates the entire neck, yet if it does not truly exist in the posterior neck region, does it actually exist as a tangible structure in the anterior neck? With regard to the deep midline fascial structures that arise from the pretracheal fascia, the presence of two separate spaces, the retropharyngeal and danger space, divided by the alar fascia in the posterior pharyngeal region, is still debated and is yet resolved in the clinical literature. 
 The aims of this qualitative study were to: 1. determine the dural ligamentous and tendinous connections in the posterior atlanto-occipital (PAO) interspace region, and establish the morphology of the PAO membrane, 2. determine whether the investing layer of the DCF is a distinct fibrous structure in the anterior neck and examine the relationship with the subcutaneous platysma muscle, and 3. determine the relationship between the RPS and DS in the posterior pharynx region and identify the configuration of the alar fascia. Twenty-seven cadavers were examined at the gross, macro- and, microscopic level. Blunt and sharp dissections were conducted on 12 specimens. Fifteen cadavers were prepared as epoxy sheet plastinates. Light, fluorescent and confocal microscopy was conducted on the sheet plastinations.The findings of the first study demonstrated that small discrete bundles from medial tendinous fibres of RCPm formed a fibrous connective tissue bridge directly with the spinal dura in the SOS (in all 6 median-sectioned plastinated specimens), not the nuchal ligament as commonly reported. The RCPm fascia, in conjunction with lateral contributions from the perivascular sheath, formed the PAO membrane (ligamentum flavum) which was not continuous with the neural arch of C1 as often cited in anatomical texts. The cerebrospinal junction was also demonstrated to be a naturally formed multi-layered structure in all plastinates and not the result of pathological change as widely reported in clinical literature.The Gross dissection findings of the second study supported the traditional view that the investing layer formed a covering over the anterior triangle neck region. However, findings from plastinations, in conjunction with confocal microscopy, demonstrated clearly that the investing layer is formed from the epimysium of superficial muscles in the anterior neck. In the suprahyoid neck, it appeared disjointed with the fascia of the sternocleidomastoid (SCM) fascia isolated from the neighbouring submandibular fascia. In the infrahyoid neck, it was formed by medial fascial extensions from the omohyoid fascia, SCM fascia, and fused at the midline to the infrahyoid fascia, (pretracheal layer) resulting in two ipsilateral compartments. Distal 'finger-like' fascicles of platysma presented with individual epimysial fascia, which gave the false appearance of a thickened investing layer. These findings contravene those of the traditional view that the investing fascia is continuous at the mid-line.The findings of the third study agreed with both those reported in radiological and cadaveric studies respectively, in that the alar fascia was not present above the level of C1 as purported by radiologists, but became more apparent below this level. The alar fascia was observed to be formed from medial extensions of the carotid sheath, with some minor contributions from the lateral slips of the prevertebral fascia posteriorly, and was visible within transverse plastinated slices to the level of C7. However, at the levels of C4 and C6, the alar fascia appeared to fuse with the buccopharyngeal fascia, (posterior pretracheal layer of the DCF), a finding not previously reported. This study demonstrated, through E12 sheeted plastinated sections, that the morphology and topography of the DCF is complex, and a more precise understanding of the anatomy of the DCF and associated potential spaces is paramount clinically in otolaryngology, concerning the cervical fascial pathways of potentially life-threatening commutative pathologies.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cervical vertebrae</field><field name="subject">fasciae (anatomy)</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20060810.155517</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluating dual tasking ability following traumatic brain injury</field><field name="creator">Anderson, Tracy</field><field name="description">Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is frequently associated with both cognitive and behavioural executive dysfunction. Assessment of executive dysfunction has traditionally been measured using tests that were not based on theory and this has been postulated as one reason why there are poor predictive relationships between performance on traditional executive tasks and functional outcome following TBI. Baddeley&#65533;s (1996) working memory model may offer a theoretical basis with which to design new executive measures and possibly improve prediction of outcome. Baddeley&#65533;s theory has made recent advances in identifying core central executive (CE) processes that are likely to be relevant to TBI. 
 The research presented in the thesis used Baddeley&#65533;s proposed coordinative sub function of the CE (and it related dual tasking measure) to assess: (a) whether this theoretically based dual tasking test would be sensitive to TBI injury status and show a significant relationship with functional outcome, (b) whether the theoretically based test would be more sensitive to the above relationships than executive measures that have been traditionally available, and (c) whether more ecologically relevant dual tasks could be developed that reflect the coordinative construct and improve predictive relationships between task performance and real life functional ability. 
 This study found that Baddeley&#65533;s Dual Task Test (DTT) measure was sensitive to TBI injury and was related to functional outcome following injury. A questionnaire assessing everyday dual tasking ability was developed as was an in vivo conversation and motor based dual task. The dual tasking questionnaire reflected Baddeley&#65533;s coordinative construct, however, applications to an in vivo conversation and motor based dual task were less successful. These ecologically relevant tasks showed a relationship between language dysfluencies and dual tasking and identified avoidance of dual tasking in everyday settings as an important predictor of functional outcome following injury. Overall the DTT and the dual tasking questionnaire showed greater injury sensitivity and stronger relationships with outcome than three executive measures traditionally used in clinical practice. Regression analysis confirmed that the dual based tasks were helpful in predicting a variety of outcomes following TBI, and implications for rehabilitation planning are discussed. Further increases in the predictive power of the dual tasking construct are likely to be achieved when mechanisms of action involved in both laboratory-based and real-life dual tasking are identified. Findings from the current study suggest a range of mechanisms could be involved in dual tasks and these are discussed.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Alan D.

Structured media have a number of useful properties, including form birefringence which affects the polarization of light. Whilst oblique deposition technology is mature, there is room for further exploration to open up new applications and provide further insight. One door only recently opened is lithographic patterning, and this thesis seeks to map out part of that frontier. Lithography allows rapid replication of a pattern, and is being extended to the nano-scale, via two routes identified as "top-down" and "bottom-up". In this thesis bottom-up processing is pursued as a secondary theme, developing computer programs for investigation of the effect of substrate patterning on growth and subsequent birefringence. The primary focus is the application of top-down patterning to obliquely-deposited polarizing elements, for the production of pixellated polarizing arrays. 
 The growth of obliquely deposited coatings is well understood, and the process has been developed using dynamic substrate rotation to produce several interesting morphologies. Standard results of computer simulations are replicated for illustration. The relationship between morphology and optical properties has been extensively studied from an empirical standpoint, resulting in production of polarizing elements such as retarders, linear- and circular- polarizers. Surprisingly little study has focussed on simulation of the optical anisotropy of arbitrary structures, and here programs are developed for initial prediction of the birefringence of coatings deposited over patterned substrates. 
 Top-down patterning approaches are directly applied to obliquely-deposited dielectric coatings. Standard reactive ion etching protocols are tested, particularly for silicon films, measuring the effect of deposition parameters on etch-rate. Lift-off patterning at significantly oblique angles requires special attention, and an undercut tri-layer process is developed, resulting in patterning of chiral oxide films. Additionally a novel masking process is developed, that allows the production of pixellated arrays comprised of different polarizers in a single coating operation. One such array is used as the essential component in the production of a space-multiplexed array polarimeter.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">optical coatings</field><field name="subject">anisotropy</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20060811.155729</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Novel cationic preparations of iscoms as vaccine carriers</field><field name="creator">Lendemans, Dirk G.</field><field name="description">Aim of thesis: Immuno-stimulating complexes (ISCOMs) are particulate vaccine delivery systems composed of Quillaja saponins, cholesterol and phospholipid. ISCOMs are typically spherical cage-like structures with a diameter of 40 nm and carry a negative charge. Incorporation of the respective vaccine antigen into the particles generates more potent vaccines than a simple mixture of both vaccine components. This requires the antigen to display either hydrophobic domains or positive charges, which allow interaction with the ISCOM particles. However, not all antigens fulfil this requirement and modification of these becomes necessary. Hence, the aim of this study was to design novel preparations of ISCOMs with a positive charge, suitable for adsorption of native hydrophilic antigens and poly-nucleotides, and test their potential as a novel vaccine carrier platform. 
 Methods: Two cationic lipids, DC-cholesterol and DOTAP, were selected to prepare the cationic modifications of ISCOMs. DC-cholesterol substituted for cholesterol in classical ISCOMs, whereas DOTAP substituted for their phospholipid component. The phase behaviour of colloidal systems containing Quil-A, phosphatidylcholine (PC) and DC-cholesterol and of colloidal systems comprised of Quil-A, cholesterol and DOTAP was studied by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Lipid-film hydration was utilised as the first method to prepare these colloidal systems. Selected compositions containing either DC-cholesterol or DOTAP were also prepared by dialysis as second method. A novel third method for preparing homogenous dispersions of classical ISCOMs was developed utilising ethanol injection. This method was also applied in an attempt to prepare cationic modifications of ISCOMs including DC-cholesterol and DOTAP. As in the colloidal systems comprising Quil-A, PC and DC-cholesterol transformations of structures were observed upon dilution with aqueous solutions, these transitions were also studied on classical ISCOMs using TEM and dynamic light scattering techniques. Loading of cationic colloidal structures composed of Quil-A, PC and DC-cholesterol was performed with the model protein antigen ovalbumin (OVA) and a model plasmid, and the resulting structures were analysed by fluorescence spectroscopy, TEM and gel electrophoresis. The immunological properties of non-loaded and OVA-loaded structures were studied in terms of their ability to activate murine bone marrow derived dendritic cells (mBMDC) as antigen presenting cells (APC) and OVA-specific CD8+ T cells in vitro. 
 Results: Substitution of cholesterol in classical ISCOMs with DC-cholesterol resulted in the formation of cationic cage-like structures similar to the classical particles. These were observed in pseudo-ternary Quil-A:PC:DC-cholesterol systems and even in pseudo-binary Quil-A:DC-cholesterol systems prepared by lipid-film hydration. Compositions at which cage-like structures were observed included high weight proportions of DC-cholesterol (&gt; 60%). However, samples were relatively heterogeneous, and aggregation of colloidal structures was observed at equimolar ratios of Quil-A and DC-cholesterol. The ionic strength, pH and composition of the hydration buffer were demonstrated to be important variables influencing the formation of cage-like structures. Morphological changes of pre-formed cationic cage-like structures were observed upon dilution. However, classical anionic ISCOMs showed a similar behaviour. The numbers of cationic cage-like structures appeared to increase upon prolonged storage of samples. Purification of structures and longitudinal analysis of their composition suggested an increased formation of stoichiometrically defined DC-cholesterol:Quil-A:PC complexes over time, rather than a change in composition. The substitution of phospholipid in classical ISCOMs with DOTAP also resulted in heterogeneous dispersions, and aggregation of colloidal structures was observed at equimolar ratios of Quil-A and DOTAP. Phase separation phenomena were proposed based on TEM observations. However, the formation of cage-like particles with a positive [zeta]-potential was not observed. Although ethanol injection was introduced as a novel method to prepare classical ISCOMs, its application did not result in more homogenous dispersions of cationic colloidal structures containing DC-cholesterol or DOTAP. Dialysis also failed to produce higher numbers of well-defined cationic particles, although using this method homogeneous, anionic ISCOM-like particles containing DOTAP were obtained. The efficient adsorption of OVA and plasmid DNA onto cationic structures containing Quil-A, PC and DC-cholesterol was demonstrated. The adsorption process was accompanied with a decrease in [zeta]-potential, aggregation of structures and changes in the ultra-structure, particularly at high protein:lipid ratios. The in vitro immunogenicity of dispersions containing Quil-A, PC and DC-cholesterol was equivalent to that of classical ISCOMs in terms of activation of mBMDC and OVA-specific CD8+ T cells, even though smaller amounts of Quillaja saponins and total lipid were co-delivered with OVA. Furthermore, the uptake of OVA by BMDC appeared to be more efficient in conjunction with the novel cationic dispersions. 
 Conclusions: Cationic colloidal structures containing Quillaja saponins offer great potential as vaccine delivery systems. Their advantages thus far include simple and efficient adsorption of antigen, efficient uptake by APC and immunological activity in vitro. With further development, cationic carriers containing Quillaja saponins may constitute a very potent vaccine delivery platform suitable for a variety of subunit antigens, and suffice both pharmaceutical and immunological requirements.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">drug carriers (pharmacy)</field><field name="subject">vaccines</field><field name="subject">immunological adjuvants</field><field name="subject">cations</field><field name="subject">physiological transport</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20060810.141916</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Care of children : families, dispute resolution and the Family Court</field><field name="creator">Taylor, Nicola J.</field><field name="description">This study explored family members&#65533; experience of, and satisfaction with, New Zealand Family Court dispute resolution processes concerning children&#65533;s care arrangements following parental separation. A qualitative method was employed, using individual interviews with 22 parents and 8 children from 15 families, in three court districts, during 2001-2002. Follow-up interviews were also conducted with the parents one year later to assess the factors affecting compliance with their agreements and court orders. Focus groups were held with 16 Family Court professionals (lawyers, counsellors, specialist report writers and judges) in two cities to obtain their views on the family members&#65533; perspectives. 
 Sociocultural and ecological theories, the sociology of childhood and the UNCRC provided the conceptual basis for the research. Historical developments in child custody and divorce laws, which provided the impetus for the establishment of Family Courts internationally, have also been reviewed. 
 Each parent was legally represented, with 87% of the families also attending Family Court counselling and judge-led mediation conferences. Defended hearings occurred in 27% of the cases. Family members reported a broad range of views about their legal and court experiences. They valued their interactions with professionals who took an interest in them and their children, provided clear information and support, let them have their say, and competently managed the dispute resolution processes. Dissatisfaction was frequently expressed with the conduct of ex-partners and with professionals&#65533; styles of practice, particularly where these involved erratic or uncompromising attitudes and adversarial tactics. The desire to respond to what was written in an ex-partner&#65533;s affidavit escalated some parenting disputes onto a litigation pathway. Delay, cost, gender bias, lack of enforcement of court orders, and inadequate opportunities to feel heard, understood and respected were also identified as problems associated with Family Court proceedings. Earlier access to a wider range of information, support and conciliation services was recommended, together with more post-order explanation and support. 
 The professionals wanted a stronger emphasis on the Family Court as a court of law, rather than a social agency. A clearer demarcation between the court&#65533;s conciliation and adjudication functions was considered necessary to avoid clients having unrealistic expectations of the Family Court. Family members&#65533; therapeutic needs were important, but thought best met within community-based agencies. 
 The children were aware of their parents&#65533; court proceedings and most wanted the opportunity to play a more direct role in the decision about their future living arrangements. 
 Significant or modest changes had occurred in 60% of the families by the time of their follow-up interviews. Some changes had led to a reversal in the original care arrangements, while others had impacted upon the frequency of a child&#65533;s contact with their non-resident parent. 
 A new conceptual model for the resolution of post-separation parenting disputes has been developed. This integrates the theoretical framework underpinning the study with the international research evidence on the impact of parental separation and the principles and practices of an effective child-inclusive and culturally responsive family law system.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">New Zealand Family Court</field><field name="subject">evaluation</field><field name="subject">public opinion</field><field name="subject">domestic relations courts</field><field name="subject">dispute resolution law</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20060810.120428</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Quantitative genetic models for genomic imprinting</field><field name="creator">Santure, Anna Wensley</field><field name="description">A gene is imprinted when its expression is dependent on the sex of the parent from which it was inherited. An increasing number of studies are suggesting that imprinted genes have a major influence on medically, agriculturally and evolutionarily important traits, such as disease severity and livestock production traits. While some genes have a large effect on the traits of an individual, quantitative characters such as height are influenced by many genes and by the environment, including maternal effects. The interaction between these genes and the environment produces variation in the characteristics of individuals. Many quantitative characters are likely to be influenced by a small number of imprinted genes, but at present there is no general theoretical model of the quantitative genetics of imprinting incorporating multiple loci, environmental effects and maternal effects. This research develops models for the quantitative genetics of imprinting incorporating these effects, including deriving expressions for genetic variation and resemblances between relatives. Imprinting introduces both parent-of-origin and generation dependent differences in the derivation of standard quantitative genetic models that are generally equivalent under Mendelian expression. Further, factors such as epistasis, maternal effects and interactions between genotype and environment may mask the effect of imprinting in a quantitative trait. Maternal effects may also mimic a number of signatures in variance and covariance components that are expected in a population with genomic imprinting. This research allows a more comprehensive understanding of the processes influencing an individual&#65533;s characteristics.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">genetics</field><field name="subject">quantitative genetics</field><field name="subject">genomic imprinting</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20060811.134008</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The origins and development of acoustic science in ancient Greece</field><field name="creator">Bartlett, Ross</field><field name="description">Studies in acoustics, in so far as sound and hearing are concerned, are evident from the middle of the 5th century B.C. in ancient Greece. The earliest extant works originated in Tarentum with Archytas, after which the fundamentals were developed in Athens, particularly by Aristotle. Aristotle&#65533;s writings represent the transition from rudimentary hypothesising to true philosophical argument, and display accuracies missing from earlier studies. 
 This study examines incipient acoustic theories from classical Greece, diachronically, presenting original translations of all relevant passages, to illustrate the development of fundamental consideration and the origins of acoustic science. 5th and 4th century texts are examined in detail, with questions of authenticity being answered where necessary, to decipher the true level and depth of knowledge on the subjects of sound and hearing. Extant Archytean material is paradigmatic, containing the nucleus of sound production underlying most models to follow, whilst relevant Platonic material embraces more difficult sound qualities, raising important questions for successors. The larger portion of this work centres upon the writings of Aristotle, whilst illustrating the debt he owes to his predecessors. Each aspect of sound and hearing is discussed in turn, based predominantly, though not exclusively, upon information sourced from Aristotle&#65533;s De Sensu and De Anima. Where pertinent, attention is given to his discussions of the full range of senses and sense organs. The result is a self-contained work tracing the origins and development of acoustic study from its fundamental beginnings to the critical point when the essential elements of a nascent science were in place and the door was opened for future enhancement and scientific verification.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Aristotle</field><field name="subject">De anima</field><field name="subject">De sensu et sensibilibus</field><field name="subject">Archytas of Tarentum</field><field name="subject">audiology</field><field name="subject">sound</field><field name="subject">hearing</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20060823.144633</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Hydrogen bonding in the near infrared</field><field name="creator">Howard, Daryl L.</field><field name="description">OH-stretching spectra of various vapour phase species were recorded to investigate hydrogen bonding. The species studied include 1,2-ethanediol, 1,3-propanediol, 1,4-butanediol, acetylacetone, hexafluoroacetylacetone and the complex formed in the heterogeneous mixture of methanol and trimethylamine. The spectra range from the infrared, near infrared to visible wavelengths. The main focus of this study is in the near infrared region, in which the OH-stretching overtones are dominant. 
 The near infrared and visible spectrum of formic acid has been recorded to investigate coupling across bonds, specifically a resonance occurring between OH- and CH-stretching vibrations. The same resonance was also observed in the spectrum of 1,2-ethanediol. The spectra of deuterated isotopomers of formic acid and 1,2-ethanediol were recorded to experimentally verify the resonance. 
 The inherently weak nature of the vibrational overtone transitions required sensitive spectroscopic techniques to observe the spectra. The spectra were recorded with conventional long path length absorption spectroscopy and intracavity laser photoacoustic spectroscopy. 
 Anharmonic oscillator local mode calculations of the OH-stretching transitions were performed to simulate the observed spectra. These calculations require calculation of potential energy surfaces and dipole moment functions. Simulated spectra obtained with highly correlated ab initio methods and large basis sets have yielded the best agreement with observation.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">hydrogen bonding</field><field name="subject">near infrared spectroscopy</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20060823.150321</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A bioeconomic analysis of marine reserves for Paua (Abalone) management at Stewart Island, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Schneider, Viktoria</field><field name="description">Marine reserves have increasingly been recognised for their potential to address the pervasive problem of unsustainable harvest of fisheries worldwide. Biologists advocate the benefits of increased spawning biomass, larger modal sizes and greater densities of fish within marine reserves, and the possibility of spillover to adjacent fishable areas. Bioeconomic studies, however, find that pay-offs from stand-alone marine reserves rarely compete with sustainable yield management schemes, but that they can be beneficial when stocks are heavily exploited. Most of these bioeconomic models are analytical and deterministic in nature, and therefore ignore the redistribution of effort in response to closure and the inherent uncertainty of the marine environment. 
 We present a bioeconomic analysis of a network of no-take areas around Stewart Island in New Zealand applied to the shellfish species paua (abalone) that incorporates both predicted redistribution and reduction in effort, as well as stochastic recruitment. A nested logit model is applied to spatially recorded catch and effort data by the Ministry of Fisheries between 1998 and 2003 to capture the two level decision-making process of divers. On any given day, divers decide whether to go diving at all, and if so, which of the 16 statistical areas around Stewart Island to visit. Weather conditions, spatially varying levels of catch per unit of effort and distance are used as explanatory variables to select areas for closure according to the &#65533;least economic impact&#65533; in terms of loss of diving trips. An age-structured biological model is developed with parameters specifically applied to paua stocks around Stewart Island. Virgin paua biomass as of 1974 is estimated on the basis of growth, survival, post-larval recruitment and egg production in the absence of fishing. Historic catch rates are then applied to find overall and area-specific levels of exploitation rates, spawning biomass, egg production, legal biomass and numbers of paua. In a final step, the economic model is linked to the biological model to simulate the imposition of no-take areas when taking account of the initial disproportional shift of harvest to fished areas in the first year, and the increase in overall pressure on legal biomass in the years thereafter. 
 We contribute to the marine reserve debate by showing that in the very long run, the overall yield under closure of a relatively small area approaches and even slightly surpasses the yield under no closure for an assumed spillover gradient of 40% despite the redistribution of effort. The most important benefits of marine reserves emerge when stochastic recruitment is included in the recruitment function. In practice, predictions about the stock status and the impact of different harvest levels become much more difficult when acknowledging the inherent variability of the marine environment. The likelihood of stock collapse depends on the assumed value of two recruitment parameters, which highlights the effects of parameter uncertainty and emphasizes the role of marine reserves for population persistence. We also show that under uncertainty average yields under a management regime of a network of no-take areas in addition to the quota system can equal yields under no closure for an assumed spillover gradient of 40%, despite the increased pressure on areas adjacent to the closed areas. 
 Our findings have significant implications for the management of the paua fishery at Stewart Island. For a heterogeneously abundant species, such as paua, spatial management in addition to quota limits could be vital in ensuring the long-term sustainability of the fishery given the inherent variability of the marine environment.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">abalone</field><field name="subject">paua fisheries</field><field name="subject">marine parks and reserves</field><field name="subject">Stewart Island</field><field name="subject">econometric models</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20060823.160930</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The dimensions of intangible value in business-to-business buyer-seller relationships: an intellectual capital model</field><field name="creator">Baxter, Roger</field><field name="description">A firm&#65533;s relationships with its customers contribute to its organizational capital and represent an important part of its shareholder value, so the nature of the value in these relationships needs to be understood well and managed carefully. Marketing managers therefore require techniques that will assess relationship value comprehensively in order to manage their portfolio of customer relationships effectively and in order to argue for a sufficient share of the firm&#65533;s resources to develop these market based assets for competitive advantage. At present, there is a well-established technique for assessing customer profitability analysis which assigns revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities to customers and algebraically sums their value to reach a profitability figure for each customer. 
 However, even in its more sophisticated forms, the primary focus of customer profitability analysis as it is currently used tends to be the management of profitability by way of the management of existing situations, and particularly of cost, rather than the management of the value that is potentially available in the future from the intangible aspects of a relationship. Without knowledge of the dimensions of intangible value in the relationship, the technique is restricted to assessing those relationship aspects that can be easily quantified in dollar terms by the modification of existing accounting information. 
 This leaves a gap in the available toolbox for managers in assessing relationship value, because much of the value of a relationship may be in its intangible aspects, which at present can not be readily assessed other than by a manager&#65533;s experience and intuition. In order to develop techniques specifically for intangible value assessment, it is necessary to understand the dimensions of this intangible value. Development of scales to measure the dimensions of this intangible relationship value and development of an understanding of its structure is thus a useful research goal, which is supported by calls in the literature for the quantification of market-based assets and their value Elucidation of the dimensions and structure of intangible relationship value is therefore the goal of this thesis. 
 Although there are recent reports in the literature of studies that include the intangible aspects of relationship value, most of those that have been conducted in a business-to-business context appear to be primarily concerned with investigating the drivers of value rather than its dimensions, and those that deal with the business-to-consumer context describe techniques to assess the aggregated value of many consumers, rather than an individual buyer as is required for business-to-business applications. The thesis therefore proposes a conceptual framework, synthesised from the intellectual capital literature, which provides a set of six dimensions and a structure of intangible business-to-business buyer-seller value. The six proposed dimensions are unique in that they cover the human aspects of the relationship extensively. 
 The thesis describes the testing of the proposed conceptual framework. This was achieved primarily by the use of the structural equation modelling technique on survey data that was collected from managers in the New Zealand manufacturing industry, following qualitatively analysed interviews with managers. The tests support the framework and its value dimensions. The thesis therefore concludes that this research provides a contribution to the literature on value assessment and that future research should be conducted to validate its findings.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">intangible value</field><field name="subject">relationship marketing</field><field name="subject">intangible property</field><field name="subject">intellectual capital</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20060823.162004</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The ethics of preimplantation genetic diagnosis</field><field name="creator">Thakur, Sanjay</field><field name="description">Preimplantation genetic diagnosis is a technique used in the field of assisted reproduction. The technique is applied to embryos that have been created in vitro, in order to facilitate the selection of embryos according to particular genetic parameters. The use of preimplantation genetic diagnosis by prospective parents at high risk for having a child affected by a genetic disorder has facilitated the birth of unaffected children. Preimplantation genetic diagnosis has already been used for other purposes, such as screening for gender, and could in principle be used to screen for a wide range of genetic traits. The aim of this thesis is to provide good answers to the ethical questions provoked by the advent and continuing development of preimplantation genetic diagnosis. 
 The thesis is divided into four parts. Part One provides a brief overview of the science of genetic selection. Part Two is centred on a discussion of two ethical principles. The principle of procreative liberty is based upon the idea that acts of interference in the reproductive lives of others should be avoided unless there is good justification for such acts. The principle of procreative beneficence is based upon the idea that prospective parents should select the child, of the possible children they could have, who is expected to have the best life. I will argue that the principle of procreative liberty should be applied to acts of interference in individuals&#65533; freedom to use preimplantation genetic diagnosis, while the principle of procreative beneficence should be applied to acts of selecting children. 
 In Part Three, I will endorse a position that accords embryos a relatively low moral status, reject the arguments of the disability rights critique, argue that the eugenic aspects of preimplantation genetic diagnosis do not warrant much concern, and develop a framework for critically evaluating slippery slope arguments. Finally, in Part Four, specific applications of preimplantation genetic diagnosis will be examined in detail. Although each application raises unique ethical questions, this thesis aims to demonstrate that the consistent application of the principles and preliminary conclusions developed in Parts Two and Three provides the best means for determining how PGD should be used and which uses should be restricted.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">preimplantation genetic diagnosis</field><field name="subject">human reproductive technology</field><field name="subject">medical genetics</field><field name="subject">gene therapy</field><field name="subject">moral and ethical aspects</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20060816.105106</field></doc><doc><field name="title">New left and anarchism in New Zealand from 1956 to the early 1980s : an anarchist communist interpretation</field><field name="creator">Boraman, Toby</field><field name="description">This thesis draws upon anarchist communist theory in order to provide a historical account of the New Left and the anarchist movement in New Zealand from 1956 to the early 1980s. This account explains, describes and evaluates critically these movements. 
 The praxis of the New Left and the anarchist movement can be explained by a variety of social, economic, political, cultural and psychological factors. However, overall, it is argued that these movements were largely shaped by the underlying antagonisms of global capitalism. Because the New Left emerged during a lull in working-class self-activity, the politics of the early New Left and the anarchist movement from 1956 to the late 1960s were generally reformist and quietist. The later New Left emerged during a global resurgence in class-struggle from 1968 to the early to mid 1970s. Consequently, the demeanour of the later New Left and anarchism during this period was boisterous and ebullient. 
 The New Left in New Zealand was unique in that, compared with the New Left overseas, its major organisations were neither campus-based nor dominated by students. It consisted of young workers and students who jointly established numerous small affinity groups. The early New Left was less action-oriented than the later New Left. It was formed by dissidents from the Old Left and was closely associated with anti-nuclear protest. The later New Left issued from the more confrontational wing of the anti-Vietnam War and anti-apartheid movements, and then dispersed into various new social movements from the early 1970s onwards. The anarchist movement of the 1960s and 1970s was intimately interrelated with the New Left, and hence shared most of its characteristics. 
 This work employs anarchist communism as a theoretical tool to evaluate critically the innovations and limitations of the New Left and the anarchist movement. In particular, the class-based "non-market" anarchist communist theory of Peter Kropotkin is utilised. The main criterion used for judging the New Left and anarchist movement is their emancipatory capacity to spark a process whereby the underlying social relations of capitalism are fundamentally transformed. 
 The key strengths of the New Left and the anarchist movement were their sweepingly broad anti-authoritarianism, their festive politics and their focus upon everyday life. The primary weakness of these movements was their isolation from the working-class. The New Left concentrated on supporting nationalist struggles overseas and mostly overlooked domestic class-struggle. Numerous New Leftists and anarchists championed self-management yet did not question the market and the wage-system. This thesis highlights the complexities of the New Left. For instance, the later New Left was genuinely anti-disciplinarian yet often supported totalitarian Stalinist regimes overseas. As a result, it is argued that the New Left was paradoxically both anti-authoritarian and authoritarian. 
 It is claimed that an updated anarchist communism, integrating the best qualities of the social movements of the 1960s and 1970s with classical anarchist communism, is highly relevant today because of the rise of neo-liberalism and the anti-capitalist movement, and the demise of Stalinism and social democracy.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">New Left</field><field name="subject">anarchism</field><field name="subject">anarchists</field><field name="subject">New Zealand social movements</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20060830.113811</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Speed of retrieval after traumatic brain injury</field><field name="creator">Crawford, Maria Anne</field><field name="description">Although it is well established that persons with traumatic brain injury (TBI) experience word retrieval difficulties, the underlying cause of these deficits is not known. Difficulties with word retrieval have negative social implications as they can impact on the ability to converse with others. The overarching goal of this dissertation was to determine the underlying cause of problems with word retrieval after TBI. 
 To test word retrieval in this dissertation, participants were given a series of word fluency tasks and the speed of word generation was measured. In addition to measuring interresponse times, procedures used by Rohrer, Wixted, Salmon and Butters (1995) were also followed. This involved the calculation of parameter estimates to investigate whether slowed retrieval or degraded semantic stores were responsible for the patients&#65533; word retrieval difficulties. One parameter (N) was a measure of the total number of retrievable words and the second parameter (tau) was an estimate of mean latency. 
 Study 1 was designed to trial the procedure and equipment adopted throughout this dissertation to analyse speech. University students were presented with categories on a computer screen and asked to generate as many exemplars as possible in 60 seconds. A PowerLab Chart sound system was used to measure the time that each word was generated. The results of Study 1 showed that the methodology of previous research could be replicated using the PowerLab Chart sound system. 
 In Study 2, persons with postconcussion syndrome (PCS) and matched controls were given two word fluency tasks. Results showed that on both tasks patients recalled fewer words, had longer pauses between words, and took significantly longer to generate their first word than controls. Also, patients had a significantly reduced N relative to controls, but there was no difference in tau between patients and controls. Given that the participants had not finished responding and that parameter estimates require responses to be exhausted, Study 3 was designed to replicate the findings of Study 2 using an extended recall period. 
 In Study 3, patients with PCS and matched controls completed a series of word fluency tasks and were given extended periods of time to generate words. Results showed that the patients obtained significantly fewer words on two of the tasks, but no evidence of slowed retrieval was found. There was also no difference in the estimates of N and tau between patients and controls. As the patients in Study 3 sustained more minor injuries than those in Study 2, Study 4 tested patients with severe TBI. 
 In Study 4, patients with severe TBI and matched controls were given a series of word fluency tasks. Results showed that the patients generated fewer words and experienced slowed retrieval. Again, there was no difference in the estimates of N and tau between patients and controls. The results of Study 4 confirmed the hypothesis that slowed word retrieval is a consequence of TBI. Taken together, the results of this dissertation show that an underlying slowness of processing is the primary cause of problems with word retrieval in persons with TBI.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">traumatic brain injury</field><field name="subject">brain damage</field><field name="subject">psychological aspects</field><field name="subject">word retrieval</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20060830.115029</field></doc><doc><field name="title">School and personal factors associated with being a smoker</field><field name="creator">Darling, Helen Marie</field><field name="description">Most adult smokers begin smoking during adolescence; nicotine dependence can develop relatively quickly and, once established, most smokers smoke for approximately 40 years. For adolescents dependent upon nicotine, cessation interventions are not well established. It is, therefore, essential that public health interventions focus on preventing initiation and maintenance and decreasing the prevalence of youth smoking. In spite of legislation to protect New Zealand adolescents, a large proportion continues to use tobacco at least weekly. Recent surveys have shown a slight decrease in cigarette smoking prevalence, overall, but, no reduction and marked increases have been reported within some subgroups. 
 The overall aim of this research was to identify school and personal factors associated with secondary school students smoking. The specific research objectives included: a) identifying factors at the personal, family, peer, school and 'tobacco-genic' environment levels which were associated with regular and established cigarette smoking; b) describing the extent of smoke-free policy and health education programmes in secondary schools; and, c) evaluating the relations between cigarette smoking among students and potential protective factors, smoke-free policies and practices and health education programmes. 
 The research was based on data from 3,434 secondary school students from 82 schools. The multi-stage sampling procedures and data analyses ensured that the results were able to be generalised to the New Zealand secondary school student population. Smoking was more prevalent amongst girls for all measures of smoking frequency and significant differences were found for smoking prevalence between ethnic groups and school decile. 
 In terms of family influences, the smoking behaviours of parents were not associated with increased odds of smoking nor were perceived relationships between students and their parents, or exposure to SHS. In contrast, the smoking behaviour of siblings was associated with increased odds of smoking but it is likely that both student and sibling smoking are both influenced by the same processes within the family. Similarly, low levels of self-concept were not associated with increased odds for daily smoking. The smoking behaviour of a best friend was a pervasive risk factor as was a high level of disposable income, frequent episodes of unsupervised activities, and 'pro-smoking' knowledge. Being male, visiting a place of worship, and the intention to stay at school until after Year 13 reduced the odds of daily smoking among students. 
 Multilevel models were used to identify school level effects. After adjusting for student, family and school characteristics significant between-school variance in smoking prevalence remained and this suggests that there are factors, arguably beyond the immediate control of the student or family that may influence a student&#65533;s smoking behaviour. The presence of a school effect also supports the WHO concept of 'health promoting schools' in that schools can make a difference to health outcomes. Understanding how the health promoting schools model has been interpreted and implemented in NZ schools, along with critique of the implementation of the amended legislation making all schools smoke-free, would be a pertinent 'next-step' in identifying characteristics of schools which are associated with decreased tobacco use.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">smoking</field><field name="subject">tobacco use</field><field name="subject">social aspects</field><field name="subject">psychological aspects</field><field name="subject">teenagers</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20060830.120926</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The psychophysiological consequences of depressed mood-related cognitive responses</field><field name="creator">Donaldson, Bruce William</field><field name="description">A substantial amount of research has investigated the psychophysiological profiles of various mood and emotional states; however, very little research has investigated individuals&#65533; mood responses from a psychophysiological perspective. As a result, little is known about the psychophysiological reactivity of individuals to various mood-related responses, or the ability of psychophysiological measures to differentiate between response styles. Furthermore, most investigations in the area of mood-related response styles have relied on participants self-report responses of their mood reactivity, which is considered to be susceptible to demand characteristics and response bias. Psychophysiological measures are thought to offer a unique and alternative measure of mood reactivity that can corroborate, or challenge self-report findings. They are considered to be less susceptible to demand effects than self-report, and can detect subtle changes in mood reactivity activity when an overt response is not apparent. In view of this, the primary objective of this thesis was to move beyond a reliance on subjective self-report measurements of mood reactivity, and to investigate the consequences of depressed mood-related cognitive response styles from a psychophysiological perspective. As part of this investigation, this thesis aims to address a number of theoretical and practical questions relating to the use of psychophysiological measures in mood research and clinical practice. 
 The research is divided into four studies, each one focusing on a particular aspect of the investigation. 
 The aim of Study 1 was to select and trial a laboratory-based mood induction procedure (MIP) and a self-report mood measure, with the intention of developing a reliable method of inducing and measuring depressed mood. Two film clips that contained either positive or negative affective content were presented to participants. Self-report responses on the Mood Scale confirmed that the negative film clip elicited a very unpleasant mood state with high emotional arousal, and that the positive film clip elicited a mildly pleasant mood state with low emotional arousal. The positive and negative Film Clip MIPs were then used in Studies 2 and 2a, to investigate participants&#65533; psychophysiological reactivity to induced mood. 
 The aim of Studies 2 and 2a was to identify a set of psychophysiological measures that would differentiate between participants&#65533; mood states. In Study 2, the positive and negative Film Clip MIPs, from Study 1, were again presented to participants. Corrugator supercilii facial EMG activity, zygomaticus major facial EMG activity, skin conductance activity (SCA), heart rate (plethysmograph, sphygmomanometer), systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and self-report ratings on the Mood Scale were recorded. Results confirmed that participant self-reported affective responses were similar to those reported in Study 1; however, mixed results were obtained in regards to individuals&#65533; psychophysiological responses to the MIPs. Facial EMG activity and heart rate (plethysmograph) were consistent with participants&#65533; self-reported mood, whereas, SCA and systolic blood pressure were inconsistent with participants&#65533; self-reported mood. Diastolic blood pressure and heart rate (sphygmomanometer) did not differentiate between the MIPs. As the results were somewhat contradictory to expectations, it was decided to further investigate the psychophysiology of induced mood in Study 2a, using a revised set of psychophysiological measures. 
 In Study 2a, the positive and negative Film Clip MIPs were again presented to participants. Corrugator supercilii facial EMG activity, zygomaticus major facial EMG activity, SCA, heart rate (ECG), and finger temperature, were recorded along with participants&#65533; Mood Scale ratings. It was found that facial EMG activity and SCA, paralleled participant self-report as expected, and were most responsive to participants&#65533; change in mood state. Heart rate (ECG) and finger temperature did not clearly differentiate between the induced mood states. 
 The aim of Study 3 was to conduct an experimental, laboratory-based investigation, into the psychophysiological and subjective mood consequences of two cognitive response styles: self-focused depressive rumination and external-focused distraction. As in the previous study, the negative Film Clip MIP and the Mood Scale were used to induce depressed mood and to measure participants&#65533; subjective mood state. Psychophysiological reactivity was recorded by measuring participants&#65533; corrugator supercilii facial EMG, zygomaticus major facial EMG, SCA, heart rate (sphygmomanometer), systolic blood pressure, and diastolic blood pressure. Trait response style was measured using the Response Style Questionnaire (RSQ; Nolen-Hoeksema &amp; Morrow, 1991) and social desirability was measured using the Marlowe Crowne-Social Desirability Scale (MC-SDS; Crowne &amp; Marlowe, 1960). As predicted by the Response Style Theory of depression (RST), increased self-reported negative mood was found when participants responded to the induced depressed mood, using a self-focused depressive rumination response style, rather than an external-focused distraction response style. Psychophysiological activity increased over the course of the negative Film Clip MIP for all psychophysiological measures, however, only corrugator supercilii facial EMG activity clearly differentiated between the cognitive response styles, in a way predicted by individuals&#65533; self-report responses. There was no evidence of a relationship between participants&#65533; trait response style and their psychophysiological reactivity or mood responses during the experiment. However, individuals high in trait rumination reported greater depressive symptomatology, and less mood reactivity during the experiment, than those high in trait distraction. Furthermore, participants&#65533; ratings of social desirability were positively associated with their level of depressive symptomatology and trait rumination. 
 The aim of Study 4 was to conduct a pilot study to investigate the psychophysiological consequences of two further cognitive response styles: negative automatic thoughts and positive autobiographical recall. A series of twelve single-case (ABC-ABC) experiments were carried out using a procedure analogous to a clinical therapy process. Initially a depressed Story MIP was used to induce a depressed mood in participants (A). Participants were then required to respond to their depressed mood using negative self-statements (B), and positive autobiographical recall (C). Consistent with previous studies, zygomaticus major facial EMG and corrugator supercilii facial EMG clearly paralleled participants&#65533; mood reactivity throughout the experiment, whereas SCA and heart rate showed less consistent patterns of reactivity. 
 This thesis has made an important contribution to mood and psychophysiological research by presenting the first in-depth investigation into the psychophysiological consequences of how people respond to depressed mood, from both a theoretical and a clinical perspective. It is anticipated that the findings of this research will bring about further investigation into the comparative efficacy of various brief mood-related cognitive intervention techniques, which will ultimately assist scientist-practitioners in selecting suitable brief cognitive intervention techniques for helping clients ameliorate their negative mood, emotional, and cognitive states.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">mood (psychology)</field><field name="subject">cognition</field><field name="subject">psychophysiology</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20060831.114812</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Habitats and macroinvertebrate fauna of the reef-top of Rarotonga, Cook Islands : implications for fisheries and conservation management</field><field name="creator">Drumm, Darrin Jared</field><field name="description">Throughout the Pacific, many species of echinoderms and molluscs have cultural value and are harvested extensively in subsistence fisheries. Many of these species are sedentary and often associated with distinct reef-top habitats. Despite the significance of reef habitats and their fauna for fisheries and biodiversity etc, little information has been available on the distribution of habitats and their influence on the reef-top fauna in the Cook Islands. This thesis developed a novel approach to assess the status of the shallow-water reef-tops of Rarotonga, Cook Islands, to provide critical information to fisheries and conservation managers. The approach used remote sensing (aerial photography with ground truthing) to map the spatial arrangement and extent of the entire reef-top habitats accurately, and historical wind data and coastline shape to determine the windward and leeward sides of the island. The benthic habitat maps and degree of wind exposure were used to design and undertake a stratified sampling programme to assess the distribution and abundance of the epibenthic macroinvertebrate fauna of the reef-top. I quantified the distribution and abundance of the epibenthic macroinvertebrates and how they varied with habitat, assessed the effectiveness of a traditional ra&#65533;ui (marine protected area) for conserving stocks of Trochus niloticus and other invertebrates, and investigated the reproductive biology and impacts of traditional gonad harvesting on Holothuria leucospilota. 
 There were four major habitat types (rubble/rock, sand/coral matrix, algal rim and sand) identified, the most extensive being rubble/rock (45%) and sand/coral matrix (35%). The degree of exposure to winds was found to correlate with the reef development and habitat distribution. 
 The assemblage composition of each major habitat type differed significantly from every other habitat. The rubble/rock habitat had the greatest substratum heterogeneity and structural complexity, and the highest number of species and individuals. The overall abundance of the fauna was dominated by holothurians (68%) and echinoids (30%), while Trochus niloticus and Tridacna maxima accounted for the remaining 2% of the total invertebrate assemblage. Clear habitat partitioning was also found for adult and juvenile Trochus niloticus and Tridacna maxima. 
 In the traditional fishery for Holothuria leucospilota, the mature gonads of males are harvested by making an incision in the body-wall of the animal, removing the gonads and then returning the animal to the reef to allow regeneration. Monthly collections of H. leucospilota were used to describe the reproductive biology of this species. Gametogenesis and spawning were synchronous between the sexes and spawning occurred annually during summer, when water temperature and photoperiod were at their highest. Although the incision in the body-wall and gonad removal had no impact on the survival of H.leucospilota in experimental cages, their body weight, and general sheltering and feeding behaviors were affected. Gonads took at least 41 days to start regenerating, suggesting a considerable delay in the spawning of fished individuals. 
 In 1998, five Rarotongan communities re-introduced the traditional ra&#65533;ui system of resource management, prohibiting all fishing and gathering from their reefs. The performance of the Nikao ra&#65533;ui, which had been put in place to allow trochus stocks to increase, was investigated. Comparisons of macroinvertebrate assemblage composition and species density were made between three fishing treatments, i.e. fished areas adjacent to the ra&#65533;ui, within the ra&#65533;ui after two years of protection, and in the ra&#65533;ui after it had been lifted for three weeks to allow a commercial trochus harvest. Analysis of variance on the count data for the twelve most abundant species, and non-metric multi-dimensional scaling indicated that there were no differences in the microhabitat or the invertebrate assemblage composition between the three fishing treatments. However, there were significant differences between the rubble/rock and sand/coral matrix habitat types. The results on the effectiveness of the Nikao ra&#65533;ui are equivocal, due to the small sample size, and the variability between samples which was highlighted by the wide confidence intervals. 
 This study highlights the importance of habitat to the macroinvertebrate fauna of the reef-top and the need for accurate habitat maps to increase the cost-effectiveness of future resource surveys, to provide information to management, and for the design of Marine Protected Areas. The mapping and survey methods must be reliable and repeatable in terms of the limitations of time, and the availability of expertise, funding and resources. The results provide important information for fisheries and conservation managers of Rarotonga and other Pacific Islands to better design rigorous sampling programmes for monitoring the status of reef-top resources, and for evaluating and planning Marine Protected Areas.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">reef ecology</field><field name="subject">reef resources assessment and management</field><field name="subject">marine invertebrates</field><field name="subject">marine resources conservation</field><field name="subject">fishery management</field><field name="subject">marine parks and reserves</field><field name="subject">Cook Islands</field><field name="subject">Rarotonga</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20060901.134208</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Running in pain : an autoethnography of power, coercion and injury in coach-athlete relationship</field><field name="creator">Haleem, Hussain</field><field name="description">This autoethnographic study investigates the emotional and social dimensions of a coaching relationship from the athlete&#65533;s perspective. Autoethnography is an approach that draws on highly personalised biographical accounts in which authors tell stories about their lived experiences (Ellis &amp; Bochner, 2000; Richardson, 2000) in order to place the "self within a social context" (Reed-Danahay, 1997, p. 9). Consequently, through the analysis of my memories and ethnographic notes, I analyse my experiences as an Olympic marathon runner and, in particular, the challenges I faced with my coach. In the process of investigating the emotional and social dimensions of the coaching process (which I have divided into three phases), I focus specifically on the creation of (1) my 'athletic identity', (2) the power relationship that developed between my coach and myself and, (3) my early retirement from running. In order to make sense of my experiences, I draw upon theories of identity (e.g. Bradley, 1996), Foucauldian concepts on 'power' (e.g. Foucault, 1980), and the literature addressing 'premature retirement' (e.g. Sparkes 1996; 2000).

 Three species of pigmented endophytic Phaeophyceae were isolated from New Zealand macrophytes. They were distinguished based on morphological characters in culture, in combination with their distribution among different host species and symptoms associated with the infection of hosts. ITS1 nrDNA sequences confirmed the identity of two of the species as Laminariocolax macrocystis (PETERS) PETERS in BURKHARDT &amp; PETERS and Microspongium tenuissimum (HAUCK) PETERS. A new genus and species, Xiphophorocolax aotearoae gen. et sp. ined., is suggested for the third group of endophytic Phaeophyceae. Three genetic varieties of L. macrocystis as well as two varieties each of M. tenuissimum and X. aotearoae were present among the isolates. L. macrocystis and X. aotearoae constitute new records for the marine flora of the New Zealand archipelago, on genus and species level. The red algal endophyte Mikrosyphar pachymeniae LINDAUER previously described from New Zealand is possibly synonymous with Microspongium tenuissimum. 
 The prevalence of infection by Laminariocolax macrocystis was investigated in three populations of Macrocystis pyrifera along the Otago coast. Two of the populations situated inside and at the entrance of Otago Harbour showed high infection rates (average between 95 and 100%), while an offshore population was less infected (average of 35%). 
 The phylogenetic affinities of the parasitic brown alga Herpodiscus durvillaeae, an obligate endophyte of Durvillaea antarctica (Fucales, Phaeophyceae) in New Zealand, were investigated. Analyses combined nuclear encoded ribosomal and plastid encoded RuBisCO genes. Results from parsimony, distance and likelihood methods suggest a placement of this species within the order Sphacelariales. Even though H. durvillaeae shows a reduced morphology, molecular data were supported by two morphological features characteristic for the Sphacelariales: the putative presence of apical cells and the transistory blackening of the cell wall with 'Eau de Javelle'. 
 Ultrastructural sections showed evidence for a symplastic contact between the cells of the parasite H. durvillaeae and its host D. antarctica. Within the host cortex, parasite cells attack the fields of plasmodesmata connecting host cells. In these areas, parasite cells squeeze between the host cells and form secondary plasmodesmata connecting the primary plasmodesmata of the host cells with the cytoplasma of the parasite cell. 
 Moreover, despite being described as lacking pigments, H. durvillaeae possesses a rbcL gene, and its plastids show red autofluorescence in UV light, suggesting the presence of a possibly reduced, but functional photosynthetic apparatus. Vestigial walls between developing spores in the 'secondary unilocular sporangia' of H. durvillaeae confirm the identity of these sporangia as plurilocular gametangia, derived from reduced gametophytes which were entirely transformed into gametangia.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">brown algae</field><field name="subject">endophytes</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Otago</field><field name="subject">host-parasite relationships</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20060901.141241</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Towards an understanding of the effect of revival evidenced in the writings of George Whitefield and Jonathan Edwards</field><field name="creator">Jull, David</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the revivalist writings of Jonathan Edwards (1703-1758) and George Whitefield (1714-1770) for evidence that the Great Awakening altered their perspective on revival. It is principally based on primary sources written between 1736 and 1743. Six separate chapters explore their background, their understanding of revival, their efforts at propagating it, their techniques in managing the revival, their defense of revival, and their institutionalization of revival. 
 Both their understandings of revival came from their own observations of the revivals that accompanied their evangelistic efforts. Their theological background, heavily influenced by Calvin, insisted that God was responsible for both conversions and revival. 
 The thesis notes that Whitefield&#65533;s and Edwards&#65533; use of four primary techniques to propagate revival evolved as they experienced revival. Their preaching, their organization of small, religious education groups, their publishing of sermons, and their written narratives of revival all show signs of adaptation to changing circumstances. 
 Both managed revival by using small groups and publications to guide people way from inappropriate spiritual expressions. These groups and documents also provided opportunities to educate new converts about their spiritual experiences. Edwards and Whitefield had the opportunity to clarify their understanding of revival as they defended the revival against those critics who questioned their claims about God&#65533;s role in the religious events of 1735-1743. 
 Both institutionalized revival by interacting with the next generation of evangelical ministers and by making available their doctrines and their own experiences in their published narratives. This propensity to publish their reflections on revival allowed future generations access to their revival principles. 
 The overriding hypothesis of this study is that Whitefield&#65533;s and Edwards&#65533; understanding of revival grew out of their involvement in revival in the eighteenth century religious revivals of colonial North America and that their revival writings and preaching were attempts to codify and transfer the lessons they had learned about revival to future generations of Christians who might, they hoped, themselves experience a God-ordained time of revival. 
 The key conclusions of this study are that 1) Whitefield&#65533;s and Edwards&#65533; positions on revival issues developed through repeated exposures to revival, 2) Whitefield and Edwards used similar means to propagate, manage, defend, and institutionalize revival, 3) Whitefield&#65533;s sermons and journals themselves express a clear and concise theology, 4) a comparison of Whitefield&#65533;s and Edwards&#65533; theology refutes the suggestion that the lack of a uniform theology throughout the colonies negates the reality of the Great Awakening, 5) a careful study of Whitefield&#65533;s and Edwards&#65533; revival writings produces a heightened awareness of the nature of their narrative works, 6) Edwards&#65533; revival writings show a concern for worship that is too often missed in studies of his work, 7) Edwards and Whitefield were actively involved in developing, recording, and teaching the principles of authentic revival.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">George Whitefield (1714-1770)</field><field name="subject">Jonathan Edwards (1703-1758)</field><field name="subject">evangelical revival</field><field name="subject">Great Awakening</field><field name="subject">preaching</field><field name="subject">United States church history</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20060908.150022</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Visualising attribute and spatial uncertainty in choropleth maps using hierachical spatial data models</field><field name="creator">Kardos, Julian</field><field name="description">This thesis defines a novel and intuitive method to visually represent attribute uncertainty, and spatial boundary uncertainty generated from choropleth maps. Like all data, it is not possible to know exactly how far from the truth spatial data used for choropleth mapping is. When spatial data is used in a decision-making context a visual representation of data correctness may become a valuable addition. As an example, the visualisation of uncertainty is illustrated using choropleth mapping techniques superimposed on New Zealand 2001 census data, but other spatial datasets could have been employed. Both attribute and spatial uncertainty are considered, with Monte Carlo statistical simulations being used to model attribute uncertainty. 
 A visualisation technique to manage certain choropleth spatial boundary issues (i.e. the modifiable areal unit problem - MAUP) and uncertainty in attribute data is introduced, especially catering for attribute and choropleth spatial boundary uncertainty simultaneously. The new uncertainty visualisation method uses the quadtree spatial data model (SDM) in a novel manner. It is shown that by adapting the quadtree SDM to divide according to uncertainty levels possessed by attributes (associated with areal units), rather than divide on the basis of homogeneous regions (as the original quadtree design was intended), a measure of attribute and choropleth spatial boundary uncertainty can be exhibited. The variable cell size of the structure expresses uncertainty, with larger cell size indicating large uncertainty, and vice versa. The new quadtree SDM was termed the trustree. A software suite called TRUST v1.0 (The Representation of Uncertainty using Scale-unspecific Tessellations) was developed to create square trustree visualisations. 
 The visual appeal and representational accuracy of the trustree was investigated. Representative accuracy and visual appeal increased when using hexagonal tessellations instead of the quadtree&#65533;s traditional square tessellation. In particular, the Hexagonal or Rhombus (HoR) quadtree designed by Bell et al. (1989) was used to programme TRUST v1.1. Using the HoR quadtree in rhombic mode (TRUST v1.1.1) produced Orbison&#65533;s optical illusion, so it was disregarded. However, the HoR trustree (the hexagonal tessellation produced by TRUST v1.1.2) was adopted for further research and user assessment. When assessed using an Internet survey, the HoR trustree adequately displayed choropleth spatial boundary uncertainty, but not attribute uncertainty. New trustree visualisations, the value-by-area (VBA) trustree and adjacent HoR trustree were developed to help increase the expression of attribute uncertainty. Upon reassessment, the new trustree visualisations were deemed usable to express attribute uncertainty and choropleth spatial boundary uncertainty at a modest 58% usable (HoR trustree), 80% usable (VBA trustree) and 85% usable (adjacent HoR trustree). A usability test (where participants were asked to spot different levels of uncertainty) validated these results, whereby the HoR trustree achieved a 65% accuracy level and the VBA trustree achieved an 80% accuracy level. The user assessments helped to highlight that the trustree could be used in two ways, to express detail within or clutter over areal units. The HoR trustree showed (1) a level of detail (or resolution) metaphor, where more detail represented more accuracy and/or the reverse, (2) a metaphor of clutter, where the data structure output was sufficiently dense as to cover spatial information, in effect hiding uncertain areas. Further Internet survey testing showed the trustree tessellation works better when representing a metaphor of detail. Attribute and spatial uncertainty can be effectively expressed depending on the tessellation level used. 
 Overall, the new TRUST suite visualisations compare favourably with existing uncertainty visualisation techniques. Some uncertainty visualisation methods consistently performed better than the TRUST visualisations such as blinking areas, adjacent value and non-continuous cartograms. Other methods like colour saturation, image sharpness and a three-dimensional surface frequently performed with less usability. Therefore, the TRUST visualisations have found their place amongst other uncertainty visualisation methods. However, survey results showed that TRUST is a viable option for visualising two forms of uncertainty - attribute and spatial uncertainty. No other visualisation method has these capabilities. Further research could include a laboratory assessment of TRUST and also incorporating vagueness and temporal uncertainty concepts. Additionally, end-user testing could provide a valuable insight into uncertainty visualisation for everyday use. Adopting uncertainty methods to uncertainty, such as the technique presented here, into the mainstream decision making environment could be considered a fundamental objective for future investigation in spatial studies.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">geographic information systems</field><field name="subject">demographic surveys</field><field name="subject">census undercounts</field><field name="subject">2001 New Zealand Census</field><field name="subject">minorities</field><field name="subject">population maps</field><field name="subject">population statistics</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20060908.151014</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Synthesis and characterization of mitochondrially targeted superoxide dismutase and thiol peroxidase enzyme mimetics</field><field name="creator">Kelso, Geoffrey F.</field><field name="description">The production of reactive oxygen species by mitochondria is implicated in the mitochondrial dysfunction associated with a range of diseases and ageing. In contrast, reactive oxygen species produced by mitochondria are involved in redox signalling pathways necessary for modulating a number of cell processes. Mitochondrially targeted antioxidants comprised of an antioxidant moiety linked to a lipophilic triphenylphosphonium cation have recently been used to decrease reactive oxygen species-mediated oxidative damage to mitochondria and to investigate the role of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species in redox signalling. These lipophilic cations are selectively accumulated by mitochondria within cells due to the mitochondrial membrane potential. This thesis presents the synthesis and characterization of mitochondrially targeted antioxidant superoxide dismutase and thiol peroxidase mimetics. 
 A mitochondrially targeted derivative of the Mn(II) macrocycle SOD mimetic M40403 (MitoSOD) was synthesized by Mn(II) template synthesis of a chiral tetraamine component and a triphenylphosphonium derivative of 2,6-pyridinedialdehyde. Racemic tetraamine was synthesized by mono-protection of racemic diamine followed by reductive amination of glyoxal and deprotection of di-protected tetraamine but overall this was found to be less efficient than a reported method based on trityl protection. The synthesis of the triphenylphosphonium derivative of 2,6-pyridinedialdehyde involved substitution of protected 4-bromo-2,6-pyridinedialdehyde by the thiolate of 3-mercaptoproanol followed by simultaneous deprotection and alkyl bromide formation, and triphenylphosphine substitution of the thioalkyl bromide substituent. MitoSOD was found to be more lipophilic than M40403 and was kinetically stable to dissociation to Mn(II) and macrocyclic ligand at physiological pH. Pulse radiolysis kinetic studies indicated both MitoSOD and M40403 catalyse the dismutation of superoxide. Fast conductivity and spectrophotometric measurements indicated the mechanism of catalysis involved reaction of the Mn(II) centre with superoxide to give a Mn(III)-peroxide intermediate which reacted with further superoxide to give the parent Mn(II) macrocycle. MitoSOD was significantly accumulated by mitochondria and this was dependent to some extent on the mitochondrial membrane potential. In addition, MitoSOD appeared to react with a product of mitochondrial succinate respiration. 
 A mitochondrially targeted derivative of the organoselenium thiol peroxidase mimetic ebselen (Mitoebselen) was synthesized by O-alkylation of a phenolic ebselen derivative with a triphenylphosphonium derivative of an alkyl iodide. Reaction of excess triphenylphosphine with an ebselen derivative containing an alkyl iodide substituent resulted in substitution of iodide and, unexpectedly, reduction of the isoselenazole moiety to the diselenide redox form. Mitoebselen and its diselenide were both readily reduced to a selenol by an excess of the physiological thiol glutathione. Reaction of the selenol with excess peroxide generated the diselenide, possibly via reaction of unreacted selenol with Mitoebselen formed from a selenenic acid intermediate or with selenenic acid directly. Mitoebselen and its diselenide were both oxidized by excess peroxide to a selenoxide but these reactions were much slower than those between selenol and peroxides, and those between Mitoebselen or its diselenide with glutathione. Together these studies suggested cyclic pathways other than a selenolisoselenazole-selenol cycle could be involved in Mitoebselen or ebselen-catalysed thiol peroxidation.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">superoxide dismutase</field><field name="subject">thiols</field><field name="subject">mitochondrial DNA</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20060908.155846</field></doc><doc><field name="title">De bello civili, Book 1</field><field name="creator">Roche, Paul</field><field name="description">This thesis represents the first full-scale, English commentary on the opening book of Lucan&#65533;s epic poem, De Bello Ciuili, in sixty-five years. Its fundamental purpose is to explain the language and content of the Latin text of the book. The subject matter of the thesis beyond the introduction is naturally dependent upon the content of each individual line under consideration, but the following questions may help establish some of the larger issues I have prioritised throughout my response to the Latin text of book one. These questions may be variously relevant to an episode within book one of De Bello Ciuili, or else a sentence, a line, a word, a metrical issue, or a combination of these. How does it help locate the text within the genre of epic? What does it contribute to the overall meaning of the poem? What does it contribute to our understanding of epic narrative technique? What does it contribute to our understanding of Lucan&#65533;s poetic usage and technique? How does it interact with the rest of the poem (i.e. what are the structural or intratextual markers advertised and what do they contribute to the meaning of the passage under consideration or the structure of the book or poem as a whole)?

Some of these arise out of the commercial interest present in sport that links sporting success with funding, sponsorship deals and media interest. The requirement that athletes stay at peak physical function in order to be successful can, at times, be at odds with concepts of well-being and good health. The employment structure under which doctors are engaged by teams and the employment contracts which define these relationships can be the source of divided loyalty for doctors. For example, sharing health information beyond the doctor-athlete relationship may be in line with contractual obligations, but at odds with what the athlete requests. Divided loyalties also exist when athletes wish to participate in sport despite high risk of harm. Here there is a difference between what the doctor understands as the athlete&#65533;s best interest, and the athlete&#65533;s consideration of best interest. 
 This thesis adopts two strategies for examining the area of sports medicine in elite athletes in New Zealand. The first section utilizes qualitative research. Sixteen sports doctors were interviewed and the data analysed. The next section involves normative reflection. Here two issues (where a range of behaviours were exhibited by participants) selected from the data are considered and discussion is presented on how doctors should respond to these issues. An examination of the level of guidance offered to sports doctors from the Australasian College of Sports Physician&#65533;s Code of Ethics follows. The level of guidance offered is considered inadequate and the thesis ends with a call to attend to these concerns.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australasian College of Sports Physicians Code of Ethics</field><field name="subject">sports medicine</field><field name="subject">medical ethics</field><field name="subject">New Zealand contracts</field><field name="subject">compromise (law)</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20060911.150036</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The impact of economic theory on the art of clinical practice : a study of science, meaning, and health</field><field name="creator">Muir, Lauretta</field><field name="description">In being philosophically based this thesis is concerned with understanding the human condition with particular reference to matters of meaning and how these find expression in systems of government and social policy. 
 This study is based on the premise that concepts determine how the world is viewed and people use a variety of conceptual schemes to answer different classes of questions. Scientific endeavour is based in a scheme that enables questions about the material world to be answered. It cannot however answer classes of questions related to many features of human lives as its methods necessitate the development and use of abstractions and generalisations that are ill-equipped by design to determine what is important to people and what motivates and satisfies them. Therefore, the reality of any particular individual or group cannot be adequately understood in scientific terms. 
 The thesis examines the scientific conceptual framework and minimalist abstractions of the medical model and the quasi-scientific conceptual frameworks of economics and identifies their conceptual limits. It shows that if the medical model is assumed to provide a complete representation of realities in health and is uncritically used as the basis of medical practice it has the potential to overlook the patient as a person and distance medical practice from its social roots which can lead to adverse outcomes for both clinical practice and medicine itself. It also observes that the economic scheme has conceptual limits that create their own distorted representations of reality. A similar dislocation in the meaning of people&#65533;s lives occurs when abstractions are made by adopting concepts from other schemes based in science, such as the medical model, without any awareness of their conceptual limits. Further distortions occur when these other accounts are turned into economic ones. Not only is the patient as a person overlooked, so is the patient as an entity. 
 In light of these observations the thesis examines health reforms that have taken place in New Zealand, whereby the economic scheme has been given dominance in the development of public policy and set the parameters for rationality and what can acceptably be said. It shows that in not recognising features of meaning these parameters have led to health sector reforms that have had unintended and adverse consequences for clinical practice, as shown in the particular case of reforms of maternity services. Furthermore these reforms have severed the health sector from its social roots and moral frameworks and created barriers between it and government so that health sector problems that cannot be understood using economic parameters cannot be addressed in forums where public policy is developed.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">clinical medicine</field><field name="subject">health care reform</field><field name="subject">medical policy</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">economic aspects</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20060911.160405</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Precursors for schizophrenia : are schizotaxia and schizotypy related?</field><field name="creator">Whitehead, Kirsty Victoria</field><field name="description">Meehl&#65533;s (1962, 1989, 1990b) schizotypy and Tsuang et al.&#65533;s (1999b, 2000a, 2000b) schizotaxia are fundamentally different notions of the schizophrenia precursor. Both represent a categorical precursor but differ in the nature of their relationships to schizophrenia. Specifically, schizotypy is dimensional, unchanging despite the presence or remission of schizophrenia. In contrast, schizotaxia is a transitional precursor; the presence of schizophrenia signals the end of schizotaxia. There are also differences in the way in which risk is determined. Schizotypy is reflected in a variety of information processing and experiential aberrations, is typically assessed using self-report measures, and is best identified using taxometric analyses. In contrast, schizotaxia is characterised by negative symptoms of schizophrenia and neurocognitive impairment, can be assessed using standardised clinical measures, and is diagnosed at the individual case level. 
 The aim of Phase 1 of this study was to investigate the manifest structure of Meehl&#65533;s schizotypy in a sample of psychiatric patients. The aims of Phase 2 were to determine if schizotypy group membership was associated with poorer functioning and to determine the nature of the relationship between Meehl&#65533;s (1962, 1989, 1990b) schizotypy and Tsuang et al.&#65533;s (1999b, 2000a, 2000b) schizotaxia. Participants in Phase 1 were 109 psychiatric patients and all completed a self-report measure of schizotypy, the Thinking and Perceptual Style Questionnaire (TPSQ; Linscott &amp; Knight, 2004). Multivariate taxometric analyses of TPSQ subscales yielded evidence of a manifest group structure within the sample. The prevalence of the latent group, presumed to reflect schizotypy, was estimated to be 32% (SD = 8%), as yielded by MAXCOV analyses. MAXCOV analyses also yielded a mean indicator validity of 1.02; variance of 7; base rate estimates of .08; and a goodness of fit index of .98. MAMBAC analyses yielded a mean base rate of 56% (SD = 18%). 
 Twenty-nine participants from Phase 1 took part in Phase 2. Fourteen were from the schizotypy group (had a p value of .85 or higher of schizotypy group membership) and 15 from the nonschizotypy group (had a p value of .03 or lower of schizotypy group membership). Participants completed tests of attention, verbal memory, and executive functioning. Negative symptoms of schizophrenia were also rated and diagnosis was determined using a diagnostic interview. The schizotypy group was significantly impaired relative to the nonschizotypy group on neuropsychological test scores spanning domains of attention, verbal memory, and executive functioning. A current DSM-IV diagnosis was made for 71% of the schizotypy group and 43% of the nonschizotypy group. Individuals were classified as having met criteria for schizotaxia if they had a negative symptom impairment and a neuropsychological impairment in two domains. A total of 7 people of 29 met criteria for schizotaxia, 6 of these people were from the schizotypy group. There was statistical evidence that Meehl&#65533;s (1962, 1989, 1990b) schizotypy and Tsuang et al.&#65533;s (1999b, 2000a, 2000b) schizotaxia are not independent. The proposed precursors for schizophrenia may reflect the same construct, not separate entities. Limitations and implications of these results are considered.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">schizophrenia</field><field name="subject">schizotypal personality disorder</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20060829.150420</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A feasibility study of occupational exposure and acute injury outcome information collection methods for New Zealand agricultural workers</field><field name="creator">Horsburgh, Simon</field><field name="description">Background: Agricultural workers in New Zealand have high rates of occupational injury compared to most other occupational groups. They are also over-represented in work-related fatal injury statistics. While it is recognised that the personal and social costs of occupational injuries to agricultural workers are considerable, the ability to develop and evaluate evidence-based injury control strategies for this group has been limited by the lack of quality information on occupational exposures and injury events. 
 Aim: The aim of this thesis was to develop and pilot a comprehensive occupational exposure and acute injury outcome data collection system for agricultural workers which will provide an evidence base for a public health approach to acute occupational injury control within the agricultural sector of New Zealand. The thesis objectives were therefore to: 
 * Develop study methods to collect occupational exposure and injury outcome information. 
 * Assess the likely validity of these study methods. 
 * Determine the feasibility of implementing the study methods. 
 * Suggest modifications to the study methods to enhance their validity and feasibility. 
 Methods: Pastoral farms in the Waitaki region of New Zealand were identified using a database of New Zealand farm owners. The owners and workers on these farms were contacted and asked to participate. Participants were required to complete an Initial Questionnaire which included items on farm and personal characteristics, the farm environment, training, safety perceptions and attitudes and safety behaviour. Participants were then monitored for six months. During the monitoring period each participant completed a monthly log of their work activities during the preceding week. Any work-related injuries to workers on participating farms were also recorded and reported monthly. Participants who were injured were followed up for an interview to obtain detailed injury event information. At the end of the monitoring period a second Questionnaire was administered to assess change during the study. Participants were asked about any occupational injury events during the study as part of one of the monthly logs and the second Questionnaire to provide a comparison measure to the monthly reports. A random third of participating farms were visited at the end of the study to assess the validity of participants&#65533; reports on the farm environment. 
 Results: Sixty-two farms were recruited into the study, a recruitment rate of 24%. This resulted in 82 study participants. Fifty-seven farms and 72 participants completed the study, resulting in retention rates of 92% and 88% respectively. Return of study items was high, with the lowest observed level of return being 92%. Levels of response error were low in most of the study items, with exceptions being the recording of the hours spent handling animals (37%) and total hours worked (22%). Most postal items (over 68%) were returned before a reminder call was made. 
 Participants&#65533; reports about the farm environment closely matched the observations made during the visits, with little evidence of significant misreporting. The validity of reported injury events during the study could not be determined, as the two methods of capturing injury events identified different events. 
 Conclusions: Within the limitations of the study, most of the study methods appeared to be feasible and have acceptable validity. The low recruitment rate and issues with validating the capture of injury events indicated that modifications to the study design were necessary to achieve acceptable validity and feasibility, however. Recommendations were made on how feasibility and validity might be improved.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">agricultural laborers</field><field name="subject">wounds and injuries</field><field name="subject">industrial accidents</field><field name="subject">medical statistics</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20060831.110516</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Small bacteriocins produced by Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sanguis</field><field name="creator">Hale, John D. F.</field><field name="description">Dental caries is the most common bacterial disease of humans and occurs when oral bacteria produce acids, following their fermentation of dietary carbohydrates. This acid can then cause a localised demineralisation of the tooth surface. A group of seven species of bacteria, collectively known as the mutans streptococci, have been predominantly implicated in the onset of dental caries. In particular, Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sobrinus have been shown to be the main aetiological agents of this disease in humans. Most attempts to control the microbial component of caries target these bacteria. 
 The past 50 years has provided considerable information about the pathogenesis of dental caries, the likely route and time of transmission of cariogenic bacteria to susceptible hosts and possible ways of either treating or controlling the onset of this disease. In regards to the latter, many techniques (such as the use of tooth brushes, mouth washes, dental floss and tooth paste) for the control of plaque build-up exist and the examples listed are generally part of a daily routine. However, these techniques need to be applied regularly, and as such only highly-motivated individuals generally experience improved oral health. Therefore, the search for more effective less labour-intensive approaches continues. One area of research is into the potential application of small ribosomally-synthesised antimicrobial peptides, known as bacteriocins. Bacteriocins generally inhibit closely-related species that occupy the same ecological niche. Their relatively-specific targeting, plus the fact that many are remarkably heat and chemically-stable molecules, makes them excellent candidates for possible anti-caries applications. 
 Numerous bacteriocins produced by the lactic acid bacteria have now been identified. Most can be broadly categorised into one of four main classes, of which Class I, the lantibiotics and Class II, the small (&lt;10 kDa) non-modified peptides, contain the most examples. Many screens for anti-mutans streptococcal (MS) bacteriocins have been carried out and it appears that the best source of anti-MS bacteriocins are the mutans streptococci themselves. Research in this laboratory has identified examples of anti-mutans streptococcal bacteriocins produced by both mutans streptococci and non-mutans streptococci. The present study investigated the anti-MS inhibitors produced by two streptococcal strains, S. mutans N and Streptococcus sanguis K11. During the course of this study a third strain, S. mutans UA159, was also studied for its bacteriocinogenic properties. 
 Although S. sanguis K11 produces anti-mutans streptococcal inhibitory activity, this appears only effective against Streptococcus rattus. In addition however, the inhibitory activity of this strain is also directed against all tested strains of Streptococcus agalactiae and ca. 50% of Streptococcus pyogenes. In the present study a 5069 Da novel inhibitory agent (sanguicin K11) was characterised and shown responsible for this unusual inhibitory spectrum. Through reverse genetics the sanK11 locus was identified and shown to encode a Class II type bacteriocin, the first shown to be produced by S. sanguis. Following screens of additional S. sanguis, sanK11 was shown to be present only in strains producing the same type of inhibitory pattern (P-type) as strain K11. The cysteine residues at positions 7 and 38 of the sanguicin K11 propeptide were shown to form a disulphide bridge essential for sanguicin K11 inhibitory activity. 
 S. mutans N and eight other S. mutans strains have been found to have what appears to be the same inhibitory spectrum, which includes members of the mutans streptococci and several other oral streptococcal species. One strain (UA140) of the eight has previously been shown to produce the lantibiotic mutacin I and the non-lantibiotic mutacin IV. S. mutans N was known to produce the non-lantibiotic mutacin N. The current study set out to investigate how two strains, apparently producing completely different bacteriocins could have the same inhibitory spectrum. Reverse genetics identified the mutacin N structural gene (mutN) and mutagenesis studies showed that this bacteriocin was responsible only for the inhibitory activity against mutans streptococci. Further sequencing around the mutN locus identified a second bacteriocin-like locus (mutO) adjacent to mutN. mutO was also identified to have anti-mutans streptococcal inhibitory activity and because of the close proximity of mutO and mutN and given the homology they share with other known two-peptide bacteriocins it seemed probable that mutacins O and N are components of a new member of this special class of bacteriocins (Class IIb, the two peptide bacteriocins) in which the optimal inhibitory activity is dependent on the co-operative activity of the two peptides. 
 Further investigations of strain N examined the expression of mutacins O and N. During a search for a suitable heterologous non-mutacinogenic S. mutans strain to act as an expression host, the genome reference strain, S. mutans UA159 was given consideration. However, contrary to previous reports, this strain was found to exhibit bacteriocin-like inhibitory activity. During a follow-up investigation, strain UA159 was found to inhibit 84 strains representing 11 different species of bacteria, but no inhibition of mutans streptococci was detected. The locus (nlmAB) encoding the two-peptide bacteriocin mutacin IV was identified within the UA159 genome. Using genetic dissection of nlmA and nlmB, the contribution of each peptide was examined and it was found that only the NlmA* propeptide appears to be active, raising doubts as to whether mutacin IV is a bona fide two-peptide bacteriocin. Deletion of the entire nlmAB locus created a mutant strain that exhibited a loss of inhibitory activity against the same 64 strains as was found for the nlmA mutant. A BLASTP search for the consensus leader sequence that precedes the propeptide of Class II bacteriocins, identified ORFs encoding 9 more putative bacteriocin-like peptides. Further genetic dissection identified the SMU.1914c locus as being responsible for the inhibitory activity against a further 15 strains not already sensitive to mutacin IV. SMU.1914c was renamed mutacin V. However, it appears that another as yet unidentified mutacin(s) is also produced by strain UA159 given that three indicator strains still remained sensitive to a double mutant [UA[Delta](1914/NlmAB)] in which both the mutacin IV and putative mutacin V loci were inactivated. 
 Export of Class II bacteriocins has been found to occur by either a SEC-dependent system or via a dedicated peptide ATP Binding Cassette (ABC) transporter. Three potential ABC transporter ORFs were identified in S. mutans UA159. Two (comA and cslA) had the characteristic accessory factor ORF (comB and cslB respectively) located adjacent to the main ABC transporter ORF, while the third ORF763 appeared to lack this. Mutagenesis of each of these five ORFS was carried out and confirmed cslAB to be the ABC transporter involved in the export of the competence stimulating factor, while the function of ORF763 could not be established in this study. Mutagenesis of either comA or comB resulted in a complete cessation of bacteriocin production by the respective mutant strains. Historically, comA and comB is the nomenclature used for loci encoding the exporter of the competence inducing factors in streptococci. In light of this new information, comA and comB were renamed nlmT and nlmE respectively, to account for the newly defined role of this ABC transporter. 
 The present study investigated four bacteriocins two of which (sanguicin K11 and mutacin ON) appear to have some potential for application to anti-caries control, and the others (mutacins IV and V) being shown to be produced by the genome reference strain (UA159). All three mutacins were shown to be exported from their respective producer cells by the NlmTE ABC transporter, while sanguicin K11 is predicted to be exported by a peptide ABC transporter located adjacent to sanK11. 
 Bacteriocins may yet provide a novel alternative for the treatment and control of dental caries. In their favour is that fact that they have relatively narrow defined inhibitory spectra and thus are unlikely to produce widespread changes to plaque ecosystems. Potential uses include as topical agents where bacteriocin preparations could be incorporated into dentrifices such as toothpastes or mouthwashes. Alternatively, streptococci producing anti-mutans streptococcal bacteriocins could be implanted into the oral cavity in strain replacement therapy strategies. There are pros and cons to each technique and the most effective anti-caries control appears more likely to result from "cocktail therapy" where bacteriocins are combined with a number of other anti-mutans streptococcal agents to achieve long-lasting protection against mutans streptococcus proliferation.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Streptococcus mutans</field><field name="subject">Streptococcus sanguis</field><field name="subject">bacteriocins</field><field name="subject">dental caries</field><field name="subject">dental plaque</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20060905.144149</field></doc><doc><field name="title">"Lest we lose our Eden" : Jessie Kesson and the question of gender</field><field name="creator">Anderson, Elizabeth Joan</field><field name="description">My doctoral thesis focuses on the twentieth-century Scottish writer, Jessie Kesson, examining the effects of the cultural construction of gender from a feminist psychoanalytic perspective. 
 Although my primary focus is on the detrimental effects traditional gender roles have on girls and women, recently published studies claiming that 'masculinity' is in a state of crisis are of particular value to my work. The reasons contemporary critics offer for this 'crisis in masculinity' vary widely. There are those who are convinced that women are to blame for abandoning their traditional roles as wives and mothers and moving too far into areas of society that are traditionally 'male'. This, they believe, results in a 'feminised' society that has an adverse effect on the development and well-being of boys and men. Those who support this argument generally believe that social, emotional and psychological distinctions between the genders are biologically inherent rather than socially constructed, and would prefer to see gender positions polarised rather than assimilated. At the other end of the scale are those who believe that the behaviours associated with traditional 'masculinity' are outmoded, fostering a form of emotional distrophy that is responsible for the increase in male suicide and autistic-like behaviours. Those who support this argument believe that males should develop a new set of behavioural traits more closely aligned to those traditionally thought of as 'feminine': traits like spontaneity, expressiveness, empathy and compassion. 
 I have found the latter arguments exciting on two counts: firstly because an increasing number of male critics are joining female critics in acknowledging that many of the traits and behaviours traditionally associated with 'masculinity' are life-denying for both sexes; secondly, and most importantly, because these critics are echoing the findings of the feminist psychoanalytic critic, Jessica Benjamin, whose work I have found so stimulating. But, where critics have pointed to the problem ('masculine' behaviour) and recommended that it be modified to something more closely resembling 'feminine' behaviour, Benjamin has not only identified the source of the problem, she has developed a revised theory of human development, 'Intersubjectivity', which offers a positive and transformative approach to human behaviour. I examine Benjamin&#65533;s theory closely in Chapter Two, and make use of it in succeeding chapters. 
 In May 2000, financed by the Bamforth Scholarship fund (with help from the Humanities Division of the University of Otago), I attended a conference at the University of St Andrews entitled 'Scotland: The Gendered Nation', which gave me a wider view of the concerns of contemporary Scottish writers and scholars. The paper I presented at the conference, "That great brute of a bunion!": the construction of masculinity in Jessie Kesson&#65533;s Glitter of Mica&#65533;, was published in the Spring 2001 issue of Scottish Studies Review. Following the conference I spent the rest of May in Scotland finding out more about Kesson and her writing under the generous tutelage of Kesson&#65533;s biographer, Dr Isobel (Tait) Murray, from the University of Aberdeen. Kesson wrote many plays for the BBC, and I was able to read Dr Murray&#65533;s copies of some of these unpublished works in the security of the Kings College Library, along with back copies of North-East Review to which Kesson contributed. In Edinburgh I visited the National Library of Scotland which holds back copies of The Scots Magazine containing pertinent articles by Kesson and her contemporaries. Then I travelled to those parts of North-East Scotland which feature most precisely in Kesson&#65533;s life and writing. My Scottish month was invaluable for its insight into the critical literary climate of Scotland, and for allowing me to reach Jessie Kesson imaginatively: through the boarded-up windows of the Orphanage at Skene; by the ruined Cathedral at Elgin; at the top of Our Lady&#65533;s Lane; and on the steps of her cottar house at Westertown Farm. [SEE FOOTNOTE] It was a privilege to trace Kesson&#65533;s footsteps and then to return to the other side of the world with a much keener sense of her 'place'. I would like to think this has carried over into my work, the structure of which is as follows: 
 Chapter One gives a brief history of Jessie Kesson&#65533;s life and writing. Chapter Two focuses on Jessica Benjamin the feminist psychoanalytic critic whose work provides the main theoretical framework for my thesis. Chapter Three considers the expression of female sexuality in the novella Where the Apple Ripens, and the way society conspires to have it diminish rather than enhance a sense of female self-hood. Where the Apple Ripens is not Kesson&#65533;s first published work but, because it introduces the central concerns of my thesis through the experiences of an adolescent girl, I have chosen to begin with it rather than with The White Bird Passes and to work towards increasingly complex gender relations in succeeding chapters. 
 In Chapter Four, The White Bird Passes, I look at the way Kesson depicts girls and women as instruments of male sexuality, controlled by a nervous patriarchy whose institutions (family, education, church) take away the promise of her female characters. 
 Chapter Five is centred on The Glitter of Mica, and considers the consequences of a masculinity constructed around the destruction of 'the Mother'. 
 Chapter Six considers the fate of the anonymous young woman in Another Time, Another Place, and examines the conventions of the social order that deny her self-definition. 
 Chapter Seven also examines the social conventions that shape and limit the lives of Kesson&#65533;s female characters - this time in a selection of Kesson&#65533;s short stories and poems. 
 In Chapter Eight I look at selected writers from the eighteenth to the twentieth-century whose work, in diverse and often contradictory ways, has contributed to an interrogation of gender in Scottish literature. This is not an historical and systematic survey of gender relations in Scotland; it is not even an historical and systematic survey of gender questions in Scottish literature. Rather, it is an impressionistic account of such matters in some selected Scottish literature - selected in part to cover some highly influential figures, and in part from Jessie Kesson&#65533;s more immediate context: feminine, rural, the North East. There is a place for such historical and systematic work, of course, and I hope that someone will do it. All I can hope for is that I may have provided some beginning but more importantly, that my work in this chapter will sharpen, further, an understanding of Jessie Kesson. 
 I begin with the life and work of the poet, Robert Burns. As well as featuring in Kesson&#65533;s Glitter of Mica, Burns and his legacy are matters of influence in the gendered ideal of 'Scottishness' for both laymen and writers at home and abroad. Following Burns, I contrast the unconscious gender ideology which permeates Neil Gunn&#65533;s writing with the progressive awareness of gender issues that characterises the work of Lewis Grassic Gibbon and aligns the latter with Kesson&#65533;s. I then examine the idealised landscapes and sentimentalised characters of the Kailyard era and the hostile response of the anti-Kailyard writers. This leads into an examination of Hugh MacDiarmid&#65533;s poem, A Drunk Man Looks at the Thistle. MacDiarmid, like Burns, was monumental on the Scottish literary scene and his efforts to rekindle the spirit of the primitive Scot through literature have made him influential with a smaller but equally significant group. What is of particular relevance to my work is that the ideal of 'Scottishness' fostered by writers such as Burns and MacDiarmid is heavily dependent on prescribed gender positions which promote the exploitation of women while rendering them subservient to men and politically powerless. It is from within this environment of gender-based Scottishness that Jessie Kesson and other women writers, were writing and arguing. Therefore, lastly, in Chapter Eight, I concentrate on those women writers whose work has the most relevance to the time, place and ideological content of Kesson&#65533;s writing: Violet Jacob, Catherine Carswell, Lorna Moon, Willa Muir and Nan Shepherd. The writing of all of these women is concerned with psychic well-being centred on human relations and/or self-determination and, of the five, the writings of Willa Muir and Nan Shepherd are considered more fully because of the particular contribution they make to my examination of Jessie Kesson: Willa Muir commented, both directly and indirectly, on gender matters. Nan Shepherd, quite apart from being a friend of many years to Jessie Kesson, wrote novels in which gender issues are entirely central.

In deciding between possible management options, one of the most important pieces of information required by population managers is the likely population status under possible management actions. Population dynamic models are the basic tool used in deriving this information. These models elucidate the complex processes underlying the population dynamics, and address the possible consequences/merits of management actions. These models are needed to guide the population towards desired/chosen management goals, and therefore allow managers to make informed decisions between alternative management actions. 
 The reliability that can be placed on inferences drawn from a model about the fate of a population is undoubtedly dependent on how realistically the model represents the dynamic process of the population. The realistic representation of population characteristics in models has proved to be somewhat of a thorn in the side of population biologists. This thesis focuses in particular on ways to represent environmental stochasticity and density dependence in population models. 
 Various approaches that are used in building environmental stochasticity into population models are reviewed. The most common approach represents the environmental variation by changes to demographic parameters that are assumed to follow a simple statistical distribution. For this purpose, a distribution is often selected on the basis of expert opinion, previous practice, and convenience. This thesis assesses the effect of this subjective choice of distribution on the model predictions, and develops some objective criteria for that selection based on ecological and statistical acceptability. The more commonly used distributions are compared as to their suitability, and some recommendations are made. 
 Density dependence is usually represented in population models by specifying one or more of the vital rates as a function of population density. For a number of reasons, a population-specific function cannot usually be selected based on data. The thesis develops some ecologically-motivated criteria for identifying possible function(s) that could be used for a given population by matching functional properties to population characteristics when they are known. It also identifies a series of properties that should be present in a general function which could be suitable for modelling a population when relevant population characteristics are unknown. The suitability of functions that are commonly chosen for such purposes is assessed on this basis. 
 I also evaluate the effect of the choice of a function on the resulting population trajectories. The case where the density dependence of one demographic rate is influenced by the density dependence of another is considered in some detail, as in some situations it can be modelled with little information in a relatively function-insensitive way. 
 The findings of this research will help in embedding characteristics of animal populations into population dynamics models more realistically.

C.</field><field name="description">This thesis studies the scattering properties of different types of imperfections in large Arctic and Antarctic ice sheets. Such irregularities include cracks, pressure ridges and both open and refrozen leads. The scattering by a transition region between sea ice and a very thick ice shelf, for example as is found in the Ross Sea in Antarctica, is also treated. 
 Methods of solution are based on applications of Green&#65533;s theorem to the appropriate situation, which leads to either a single integral equation or a pair of coupled integral equations to be solved at the boundary between the ice and the sea water. Those equations over a finite interval are solved using numerical quadrature, while those over semi-infinite ranges are solved using the Wiener-Hopf method. Results calculated using different techniques are able to be checked against each other, giving us great confidence in their accuracy. In particular, the scattering by three ice sheets of different thicknesses is confirmed analytically by mode-matching coupled with the residue calculus technique. 
 The scattering by the single irregularities is investigated partly for its own sake, and partly with the aim of using it to treat the scattering when large numbers of features are included in a single ice sheet. The principal objective of doing this is to observe the change in the general amounts of reflection and transmission as the background ice thickness is changed. There is enough variation in our results for us to conclude that there is definite potential for using the change in an incident wave spectrum after passing through a given ice field to estimate the background ice thickness.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">gravity waves</field><field name="subject">ice mechanics</field><field name="subject">mathematical models</field><field name="subject">Arctic Regions</field><field name="subject">Antarctica</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20060907.120444</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Biomechanical properties of arteries and veins</field><field name="creator">Cartwright, Virginia Lucille</field><field name="description">Saphenous veins are widely used as graft material in coronary artery bypass surgery. Biomechanical testing may help identify veins with the optimum chance of longevity. In this thesis, the author has constructed an experimental apparatus to measure circumferential and axial stress-strain data for such arteries and veins. Three different experimental techniques were used to obtain the dimensions of the vessels during pressure-diameter tests; the traditional method of photographic and direct measurement of the external dimensions along with the assumption of incompressibility to approximate inner dimensions; second the use of intravascular ultrasound to obtain the inner and outer dimensions of the vessels; and third the use of intravascular ultrasound for internal dimensions and photography for the outer dimensions. 
 Three forms of mathematical expression were fitted to the circumferential and axial stress-strain data. The sensitivity of the resulting material parameters was investigated with regard to conversion and reference data variations, and data from repeated experiments, experiments fitting more than one axial strain, and experiments testing the variation in elastic properties were compared. 
 The combination of the ultrasound experimental technique and exponential form of mathematical expression was found to be the most robust. Using this combination, a significant difference between material parameters of pig arteries and human saphenous veins was found . While the data indicate that material parameters of healthy and diseased veins may also differ significantly, the number of healthy veins in this study was not sufficient to be conclusive.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">veins</field><field name="subject">arteries</field><field name="subject">physiology</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20060908.145011</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Lexical approaches to backoff in statistical parsing</field><field name="creator">Lakeland, Corrin</field><field name="description">This thesis develops a new method for predicting probabilities in a statistical parser so that more sophisticated probabilistic grammars can be used. A statistical parser uses a probabilistic grammar derived from a training corpus of hand-parsed sentences. The grammar is represented as a set of constructions - in a simple case these might be context-free rules. The probability of each construction in the grammar is then estimated by counting its relative frequency in the corpus. 
 A crucial problem when building a probabilistic grammar is to select an appropriate level of granularity for describing the constructions being learned. The more constructions we include in our grammar, the more sophisticated a model of the language we produce. However, if too many different constructions are included, then our corpus is unlikely to contain reliable information about the relative frequency of many constructions. 
 In existing statistical parsers two main approaches have been taken to choosing an appropriate granularity. In a non-lexicalised parser constructions are specified as structures involving particular parts-of-speech, thereby abstracting over individual words. Thus, in the training corpus two syntactic structures involving the same parts-of-speech but different words would be treated as two instances of the same event. In a lexicalised grammar the assumption is that the individual words in a sentence carry information about its syntactic analysis over and above what is carried by its part-of-speech tags. Lexicalised grammars have the potential to provide extremely detailed syntactic analyses; however, Zipf&#65533;s law makes it hard for such grammars to be learned. 
 In this thesis, we propose a method for optimising the trade-off between informative and learnable constructions in statistical parsing. We implement a grammar which works at a level of granularity in between single words and parts-of-speech, by grouping words together using unsupervised clustering based on bigram statistics. We begin by implementing a statistical parser to serve as the basis for our experiments. The parser, based on that of Michael Collins (1999), contains a number of new features of general interest. We then implement a model of word clustering, which we believe is the first to deliver vector-based word representations for an arbitrarily large lexicon. Finally, we describe a series of experiments in which the statistical parser is trained using categories based on these word representations.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">parsing (computer grammar)</field><field name="subject">computational linguistics</field><field name="subject">natural language processing (computer science)</field><field name="subject">linguistics</field><field name="subject">statistical methods</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20060913.134736</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A good woman : silencing the self, rumination and depression in romantic relationships</field><field name="creator">Fernando, Ruwani Kumari</field><field name="description">"Rumination" and "Silencing the Self" have both been theorised to explain women&#65533;s greater vulnerability to depression. Rumination (Nolen-Hoeksema, e.g., 1987, 1991) refers to a passive focus on mood and symptoms, while Silencing the Self (Jack, 1991) refers to the socially-based belief that, broadly speaking, one should actively suppress one&#65533;s negative emotions and thoughts within romantic relationships. This thesis proposes that frequent suppression of negative emotional material within romantic relationships (self-silencing) makes that material more likely to be a target for rumination, resulting in greater depressed mood and depressive symptoms. 
 It seems paradoxical that the more one tries to suppress one&#65533;s thoughts, the more one thinks about them. Wenzlaff and Luxton (2003) have demonstrated that frequent suppression may make material more accessible and a more likely target of rumination. Study 1 was a pilot investigation. It was found that self-silencing (the broad construct) and thought suppression (a narrower construct) were related, and that both were positively correlated with rumination. Furthermore, thought suppression contributed to the relationship between self-silencing and rumination for women. 
 It was hypothesised that the more women suppress their negative feelings in romantic relationships (what Jack, 1991, describes as "Silencing the Self"), the more they will ruminate about these feelings and experience symptoms of depression. In Studies 2 and 3, the correlations among rumination, self-silencing and depression in adults and high school students were investigated. There were positive correlations among all the measured variables for adults and teenage girls, supporting the hypotheses. Regression analyses showed that for female adults and teenagers, rumination and self-silencing made unique, additive contributions to the prediction of depressive symptoms. 
 In Studies 4 and 5, the causal relationship among self-silencing, rumination and depressed mood was investigated. Participants were asked either to write about a sad event that had happened in their relationships, or a typical (neutral) event. In Study 4, participants were also instructed to write either factually about these events, or to write in a ruminative way about them. Participants&#65533; chronic tendencies to self-silence were measured and they were classed as "high" or "low" self-silencers based on a median split. Female participants who chronically self-silenced more frequently and who ruminated experienced the most dramatic decrease in mood. In Study 5 participants wrote factually or suppressed their feelings about sad or neutral events and their tendency to ruminate was measured. Participants were divided into "high" and "low" ruminators based on a median split of their rumination scores. There was no support for the alternative hypothesis that chronic ruminators who suppressed would report depressed mood. 
 Study 6 confirmed that in women, the combination of both chronic self-silencing in romantic relationships and acute rumination resulted in more severe symptoms of depression. Participants were e-mailed daily for one month about their self-silencing, rumination and negative mood. Chronic self-silencing, rumination and depressive symptoms were measured at the start and end of the month. Again, the combination of chronic self-silencing and acute rumination emerged as a better predictor of depressive symptoms than either variable alone. 
 The six studies reported in this thesis support the hypothesis that self-silencing and rumination together explain short term negative mood as well as depressive symptoms even after one month. These studies explain why certain women are more likely to experience depressed mood in the context of romantic relationships. In particular, the combination of being a high self-silencer and ruminating makes one especially vulnerable to depressed mood and depressive symptoms. 
 Clinically, there are already interventions targeted at rumination that are effective in reducing distress. However, the current research demonstrates that self-silencing may also be a promising target for intervention. Self-silencing is based on a wider understanding of the social context of depression. By targeting self-silencing, as well as rumination, depression may be more effectively treated.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">self psychology</field><field name="subject">self-denial</field><field name="subject">silence</field><field name="subject">depression</field><field name="subject">interpersonal communication</field><field name="subject">interpersonal relations</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20060829.122313</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Of scarecrows and straw men : asylum in Aoteroa New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Robertson, Julie</field><field name="description">Asylum seekers have become the primary symbols of - as well as participants in - contemporary struggles over geo-political, intellectual and moral terrain. By moving place, by their mere presence in western industrial states, by demanding their refugee status claims be examined, by exposing themselves to all the techniques of scrutiny and evaluation in the presentation of their claims, asylum seekers displace traditional western ways of feeling at 'home,' and of knowing about and acting in the world. In doing so, they reveal the extent to which the legal system of rights upon which the international refugee regime is based is a messy zone of contested demands, refracted by the varying material circumstances and political power of participants. This thesis looks at asylum in Aotearoa New Zealand from the perspective of those most involved; asylum seekers, lawyers, adjudicators, members of non-government organisations and medical professionals. Situated mid-way between abstract human rights talk and the details of individual claims, it presents refugee status determination as a complex negotiation through culturally-laden frameworks of understanding and operation that are as prevalent as they are often camouflaged.

The research investigated what students learnt about solving linear equations and examined the role of activities in this learning. 
 The investigation of learning in the classroom was guided by the principles of naturalistic enquiry. A longitudinal study was used to investigate students&#65533; learning during a unit of work that that made extensive use of activities and contexts. The longitudinal design of the study allowed the development of algebraic thinking to be investigated. The ideas of both Piaget and Vygotsky suggest that it is necessary to study the process of change in order to understand the thinking of students. A group of four students, two girls and two boys, were studied for twenty-seven lessons with each student interviewed individually within six days of each lesson, using the technique of stimulated recall. All lessons and interviews were recorded for subsequent transcription and analysis. 
 Learning to solve equations formally, using inverse operations, proved to be difficult for all the students. For two of them, their poor understandings of arithmetic structure and inverse operations were impediments that prevented them from doing more than attempt to follow procedures. Two of the students did succeed in using inverse operations to solve equations, but were still reasoning arithmetically. There was little evidence in the data that any of the students got to the point of regarding equations as objects to act on. They consistently focussed on the arithmetic procedures required for inverse operations. Even by the end of the topic the most able student, like the others, was still struggling to write algebraic statements. One of the most striking features of the results was the slow progress of the students. For at least two of the students, lack of prerequisite numeracy skills provided a good explanation of why this was so. However for the other two, poor numeracy did not appear to be a reason. The findings are, however, perhaps not too surprising. For children learning about arithmetic, the change from a process to an object view, from counting strategies to part/whole strategies, seems a particularly difficult transition to make. To move from a process to an object view of equations appears to be a similarly difficult transition. 
 The way in which the students made use of the contexts showed that the activities did not directly facilitate the students to develop an understanding of formal solution processes. The students did not usually make use of the contexts when solving equations, working at the abstract symbolic level instead. Although it was hoped that, by engaging students in meaningful activities, the students would construct understandings of formal solution processes, this did not occur. None of the activities used in the study provided a metaphor for the formal method of solving equations. It is suggested that, for a context to be of great value for teaching a mathematical concept, the physical activity should act as a metaphor for the intended mathematical activity.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">algebra</field><field name="subject">study and teaching</field><field name="subject">activity programs</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20061016.161725</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Paradigms of inflammation : interactions between calcium-binding proteins and the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE)</field><field name="creator">Lo, Alexandra Siu Lok</field><field name="description">The receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily. The result of RAGE-ligand interactions augments the proinflammatory mechanisms acting in chronic inflammatory diseases. RAGE recognises a wide range of ligands that have no apparent structural similarities. It is unclear what controls this promiscuity of RAGE. The extracellular domain of RAGE has two potential glycosylation sites. It is speculated that N-linked glycosylation may have significant impact on ligand recognition, especially of S100 calcium binding protein ligands. Two objectives of this thesis were to establish whether S100A9 acts as a ligand for RAGE and to investigate whether glycosylation of RAGE has any influence on ligand recognition. These were achieved by generating two forms of RAGE. HEK 293 cells were transfected to express full-length, membrane-bound RAGE or a secreted form comprising the extracellular domain of RAGE. Site-directed mutagenesis of RAGE showed that asparagine at position 25 is the pre-dominant N-linked glycosylation site. The carbohydrate added to asparagine 25 was further modified to a non-sialylated carboxylated N-linked glycan, specifically recognised by monoclonal antibody GB 3.1. Binding studies showed that different RAGE ligands have individual requirements for glycosylation of the receptor. Binding of AGE-modified AGE-BSA or of S100B to RAGE occured independent of N-linked glycosylation of the receptor. RAGE also binds the S100 protein, MRP-14 (S100A9). In contrast to AGE-BSA or S100B, the non-sialylated carboxylated N-glycan expressed on RAGE is crucial for binding to MRP-14. However, RAGE produced in tunicamycin containing medium and thus lacking N-linked glycosylation, shows strong binding to MRP-14. It was concluded that two forms of binding are involved: the first mechanism relies on the non-sialylated carboxylated N-glycan attached to RAGE and acts in a "tethering" fashion. The second mechanism involves a conformational change of RAGE, which results in exposure of a binding site(s) and a more conventional receptor-ligand interaction. 
 Another objective for this thesis is to study the expression of RAGE and its alternatively spliced variants. PCR analysis has revealed several variants of RAGE that result from alternative splicing mechanisms. The variant proteins are soluble due to a lack of membrane localising sequence. PCR results confirmed the presence of transcripts encoding for spliced variants of RAGE in several tumour cell lines. Among these were transcripts that should encode a soluble form of sRAGE 2. Furthermore, it was shown that sRAGE 2 transcript can be present in forms that contain the ligand-binding V-domain of RAGE or that are N-truncated and lack the V-domain. This is the first report of a soluble, N-truncated sRAGE 2 variant. 
 The results in this thesis add to our knowledge of RAGE biology. MRP-14 (S100A9) is identified as a new ligand. The control of MRP-14/RAGE interaction relies on N-linked glycosylation of the receptor and further modification of the carbohydrate. "Tethering" or stronger receptor-ligand interactions are suggested as mechanisms for controlling RAGE recognition of multiple ligands. Soluble RAGE variants that lack or contain V-domain binding regions, and hence sites for glycosylation were produced. These have the capacity to compete with membrane-bound receptor for available ligand. The control of the expression of soluble RAGE variants, in concert with the control of various modification to carbohydrate expressed on the receptor, adds a level of complexity to ligand specificity. This may ultimately result in different paradigms of the inflammatory process.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">inflammation</field><field name="subject">calcium-binding proteins</field><field name="subject">immunoglobulins</field><field name="subject">glycoproteins</field><field name="subject">glycosylation</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20061016.163427</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Aeronautical decision making : experience, training and behaviour</field><field name="creator">Batt, Richard</field><field name="description">Decision making is fundamental to all aspects of flying operations. The results that flow from poor aeronautical decision making can be both swift and devastating. 
 The work of this thesis uses data from a variety of sources to investigate the following aspects of aeronautical decision making; accident and incident case histories and pilot decision making, case-based versus rule-based pilot decision training, pilot behaviours in the face of adverse weather.
 The first part of thesis uses survey data to gain a better understanding of the role of accident and incident case histories in aviation safety and training. Anecdotal evidence suggests that exposure to case-based information can leave a lasting impression on a pilot and significantly influence their flying behaviour. To investigate this aspect more formally, information was obtained from a survey of 138 pilots. A questionnaire was then distributed to pilots worldwide and responses were received from 409 pilots, from all areas of aviation. The combined experience of pilots who responded was over 700,000 hours flying time. 
 The second part of the thesis uses experimental data to compare the effectiveness of aviation safety training using case-based material or rule-based material. Two experiments were carried out, based on the two areas that account for the majority of fatal general aviation accidents: flight into adverse weather and low flying. A total of 114 participants took part in the experimental studies. 
 The third part of the thesis is based on a set of 491 aviation accident and incident reports drawn from the Australian Transport Safety Bureau occurrence database. The study compares three groups of pilots who differed in their response to adverse weather conditions, as demonstrated by the following behaviours; VFR flight into IMC, a weather-related precautionary landing, some other significant weather avoidance action.
 A number of common themes emerged from the three parts of the thesis. There is strong support for the importance of case-based material in aviation safety and training. However, the results also suggest that aeronautical decision making can be best understood in terms of a model that combines both case-based and rule-based reasoning. Rule-based material provides a basic framework of standard procedures and recommended practices, particularly for novices, while case-based material adds detail and salience to the framework, particularly in the form of affective markers linked to particular case histories. 
 One important aspect of the results can be summed up by the adage that 'a safe pilot is a proactive pilot'. That is, it is imperative for a pilot to take control of the situation before the situation takes control of them. The results also emphasise the dynamic nature of aeronautical decision making. A pilot may make a series of good decisions, but that is no automatic protection against a subsequent poor decision putting the safety of the flight at risk. Hence, it is critical that a pilot does not fly to the limit of their abilities, or let past success breed complacency.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">aeronautics</field><field name="subject">decision making</field><field name="subject">training of air pilots</field><field name="subject">flight training</field><field name="subject">psychological aspects</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20061016.164438</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reversible deformation for computer graphics</field><field name="creator">Mason, David</field><field name="description">Since the introduction of Free Form Deformation (FFD) by Sederberg and Parry in 1986, a great deal of research has been performed in the area of space deformation for 3D shape modelling.

Subsequently, the aim of this study was to generate insight into the climate created by New Zealand national rowing coaches in an elite men&#65533;s training programme. In particular, the participants&#65533; (i.e. coaches, athletes and administrators) interpretation of this climate was sought, with specific attention to the factors which enabled and constrained its development. 
 This study relied upon ethnographic research methods using in-depth interviews, reflexive journals and observations to acquire a 'thick description' (Geertz, 1973) of the behaviour of the administrators, coaches and athletes in the programme and how that behaviour was interpreted. Data were collected over a five month period, as the athletes prepared for the upcoming Olympic trials. The participants in the study were two administrators, three coaches and eleven athletes. 
 The data were primarily analysed using concepts from grounded theory (Strauss &amp; Corbin, 1990) and, in light of the prevalence of structural and agential factors in the creation of the climate, Giddens&#65533; (1979, 1984) structuration theory. Hence, two of the three discussion chapters are principally organised around the modalities of structuration theory, namely interpretative schemes and norms (Giddens, 1979). The third discussion chapter focuses on the concept of power. In this chapter I draw upon the work of Bourdieu (1989), Foucault (1977), Giddens (1984), Nyberg (1981) and Shilling (1991) to help explain the power dynamics in the training programme. 
 Most significantly, it was found that all participants relied heavily upon their previous experience to interpret what it meant to be involved in the elite programme as well as how they were 'supposed' to act. Whilst each participant had an idea of how they were meant to behave, they also acted in ways which were dictated by the rowing community and the traditions in the sport that were considered to be normative practices. In addition, the participants also had expectations of each other&#65533;s behaviour. Often however, these were not congruent with the actual behaviours, resulting in a degree of frustration. Frustration also stemmed from the power dynamic which existed between the members of the programme. Although the coaches&#65533; role enabled them to exercise their power when working with the athletes, the athletes also exercised their power by sometimes defying the coaches&#65533; orders. Additionally, the administrators drew upon their authority to ensure their particular agenda was met, often at the expense of the coaches and athletes. This, not surprisingly, had implications on the climate of the programme as it affected the athletes&#65533; ability to trust those leading the programme which, in turn, affected their desire to train hard. The resulting climate was characterised by a degree of apathy on the part of the athletes which undoubtedly had consequences on their ability to support the programme and excel within it. 
 This research extends previous work in the coaching science community by examining the various layers of social interaction within the sporting environment. It highlights the interrelated, interdependent and sometimes problematic nature of relationships that construct and influence the climate of a training programme. The findings of this research support the importance of climate and raise the possibility it has on athlete performance.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">rowing</field><field name="subject">coaching</field><field name="subject">training</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20061018.165626</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Semantic processing in Parkinson's disease</field><field name="creator">Saunders, Vickie Ellen</field><field name="description">Parkinson&#65533;s disease is a neurodegenerative disorder, which is typically characterised in terms of its debilitating effects on motor function. However, ubiquitous neuropsychological deficits are also an integral feature of the progression of this disease. This thesis investigated these cognitive deficits as they manifest in language, with the overarching goal being to elucidate the word-finding problems that are associated with Parkinson&#65533;s disease. Making semantic judgements and identifying semantic relations are two processes that are particularly germane to word-finding. Therefore, the present thesis examined: 1) the ability of people with Parkinson&#65533;s disease to make judgements about semantic categories, and 2) the integrity of associative semantic networks in Parkinson&#65533;s disease. In the first series of studies, Cups and Bowls, a novel semantic categorisation task was used to investigate the ability of people with Parkinson&#65533;s disease to consistently categorise common kitchen items across a number of trials. The Parkinson&#65533;s group was impaired relative to an age-matched control group on this task. This inconsistent categorisation was particularly apparent for the less typical category exemplars at the category boundaries, suggesting that the Parkinson&#65533;s group had less salient or less elaborated semantic categories, which particularly compromised categorisation of the less typical category exemplars. This finding is discussed in terms of selective attention deficits and inappropriate weightings of semantic features. 
 In the second series of studies, Verbal Memory, the structure of the semantic network and access to the semantic system were further investigated using a verbal memory task, which required participants to recall word lists. These word lists consisted of semantically associated words and were designed to elicit false recall of another, non-presented, close semantic associate (the critical lure). The results of this second series of studies, particularly the fact that the Parkinson&#65533;s group recalled more of the false critical lures than the control group, suggested an intact semantic network in Parkinson&#65533;s disease and normal saliency of semantic categories. The potentiated false recall effect in the Parkinson&#65533;s group is discussed in terms of poor modulation of attention in Parkinson&#65533;s disease, both as the result of an executive deficit leading to poor controlled processing and in terms of a dopamine-modulated decrease in the signal-to-noise ratio leading to impaired automatic processing. Taken together, the results reported in the present thesis suggest that basal ganglia pathology and striatofrontal deafferentation in Parkinson&#65533;s disease do not diminish the integrity of semantic memory, but do compromise operation of semantic memory due to impaired modulation of activation/inhibition mechanisms. This finding of a selective attention deficit has implications for word-finding, suggesting that the word-finding difficulties associated with Parkinson&#65533;s disease are the result of impaired lexical access. In particular, retrieval of specific lexical items from semantic memory is impeded because of failure to modulate activation/inhibition mechanisms effectively for the target word to be distinguished from close semantic associates. An intact semantic checking mechanism in anterior language cortex prevents the production of semantic paraphasias, and results in the tip-of-the-tongue word-finding problems displayed by some people with Parkinson&#65533;s disease.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Parkinson's disease</field><field name="subject">speech disorders</field><field name="subject">semantics</field><field name="subject">psycholinguistics</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20061024.112547</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Functional diversity and ecosystem-level processes in a short-tussock grassland</field><field name="creator">Mason, Norman</field><field name="description">Increased functional diversity has been linked to an increase in ecosystem level processes (ELPs), such as productivity, ecosystem reliability and invasion resistance. However, there has been no exact definition of functional diversity and it is not known which indices are appropriate for its measurement. Consequently, continuous indices have rarely been applied in examination of relationships between functional diversity and ELPs and little is known of the mechanisms linking functional diversity to ELPs. This thesis begins by providing an exact definition of functional diversity, identifying its primary components and devising appropriate continuous indices for the measurement of these components. These indices are used to examine relationships between functional diversity and three ELPs - biomass production, the reliability of biomass production and invasion resistance. Initially these examinations are conducted using a mechanistic community assembly and dynamic model. This model is based on physiological and morphological character data for species occurring in the short-tussock grassland communities of the Luggate field experiment, in the southern South Island, New Zealand. Finally, relationships between functional diversity, mean annual community cover and the reliability of cover are examined in the Luggate field experiment. 
 Functional composition (i.e. the actual functional characters of the species within a community) appeared to exercise the greatest influence on ecosystem reliability in the community assembly and dynamic model. However, there was evidence that functional diversity increased the reliability of productivity via the co-variance effect. Functional composition also exercised the greatest influence over mean annual productivity in the model, almost completely accounting for the negative relationship between functional diversity and mean annual productivity. These results are respectively analogous to the positive and negative selection effects seen in species richness / ELP relationships. Both functional diversity and functional composition influenced community invasion resistance in the model. Here, increased functional diversity acted to increase community resistance to invasion. In the Luggate field experiment, neither functional diversity nor functional composition was related to mean annual cover, though species richness was positively related to it. Increased functional diversity acted to increase the reliability of cover. However, this did not appear to occur via the co-variance effect, but as a result of increased functional diversity increasing consistency in the species composition of experimental plots through time. 
 These results demonstrate that studies examining functional diversity must account for the effects of species identity. A framework is proposed to accommodate selection effects associated with functional diversity / ELP relationships. The usefulness of the co-variance effect as a testable mechanism linking functional diversity to ecosystem reliability in the field is questionable, as there is no objective way of measuring it.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">grassland ecology</field><field name="subject">New Zealand tussockgrass</field><field name="subject">Central Otago District</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20061024.114054</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The influence of contextual factors on revision strategies : the case of four Malaysian native speakers of English in a mainstream E.S.L. classroom</field><field name="creator">Mallan, Vijay Kumar</field><field name="description">This case study explored the revision strategies of four Malaysian native speakers of English when they composed aloud while writing an argumentative essay. Think aloud verbal protocols were analysed using the grounded theory approach in conjunction with written texts. 
 The findings suggest that contextual factors influenced classroom practices. The contextual factors included a teacher who was not provided with adequate training, administrative policies which did not provide support for the development of writers based on their abilities, writing instruction which viewed revision as a process of error correction and public assessment practices which were non-transparent. These classroom practices influenced the participants&#65533; beliefs about revision. These beliefs affected the quality of their essays as judged by Malaysian public examiners. Additionally, the findings suggest a mismatch between classroom instruction and public examination. 
 Suggestions are made to address these concerns by considering the theoretical underpinnings of the cognitive process, socio-cultural and community of practice models of writing and learning. These include instruction on revision strategies, considering alternative assessment practices, providing formative feedback, ability streaming, focussing on critical reading skills and providing adequate support to the teacher.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">English language</field><field name="subject">study and teaching</field><field name="subject">Malay speakers</field><field name="subject">foreign speakers</field><field name="subject">ability testing</field><field name="subject">errors of usage</field><field name="subject">composition and exercises</field><field name="subject">second language acquisition</field><field name="subject">composition (language arts)</field><field name="subject">context (linguistics)</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20061024.115955</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Raffaello Squarise (1856-1945) : the colonial career of an Italian maestro</field><field name="creator">Murray, David</field><field name="description">This work examines the life of Raffaello Squarise (1856-1945), an Italian maestro who was a leading musician in the city of Dunedin, New Zealand, from 1889 until his retirement in 1933. Squarise worked as a professional in a predominantly amateur musical environment, and this thesis demonstrates his widely-felt presence and discernible influence in Dunedin&#65533;s cultural life, through his activities as a violinist, teacher, conductor, and composer. Furthermore, it illustrates the nature of the active musical culture in Dunedin, through Squarise&#65533;s participation in established local practices and the contrast provided by the &#65533;otherness&#65533; of his Italian ethnicity. The thesis shows that a two-way adaptive process took place between Squarise and the Dunedin community, as each engaged with the unfamiliar culture of the other. The success of Squarise&#65533;s musical career in the antipodes, it is argued, was based upon his willingness to adapt to the cultural, intellectual, and musical environment of his adopted home. 
 The method used in this study is that of interpretative biography: it conveys the experience of the individual while emphasizing context through the subject&#65533;s interaction with his environment. The sources of the research are mainly archival, and include Squarise&#65533;s personal papers, newspapers, the archives of local music organizations, and music ephemera. These are augmented by interviews undertaken with some of the few people (nearly sixty years since his death) who knew Squarise. The thesis is a study of the public more than the private man, but the sources are extensive enough to provide a thorough representation of Squarise&#65533;s professional activities.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Rafaello Squarise (1856-1945)</field><field name="subject">New Zealand musicians</field><field name="subject">New Zealand composers</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20061024.140003</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A critical analysis of the relationships between nursing, medicine and the government in New Zealand 1984-2001</field><field name="creator">Miles, Mary Alice</field><field name="description">This thesis concerns an investigation of the tripartite arrangements between the government, the nursing and the medical sectors in New Zealand over the period 1984 to 2001 with a particular focus on primary health care. The start point is the commencement of the health reforms instituted by the Fourth New Zealand Labour Government of 1984. The thesis falls within a framework of critical inquiry, specifically, the methodology of depth hermeneutics (Thompson, 1990), a development of critical theory. 
 The effects of political and economic policies and the methodologies of neo-liberal market reform are examined together with the concept of collaboration as an ideological symbolic form, typical of enterprise culture. 
 The limitations of economic models such as public choice theory, agency theory and managerialism are examined from the point of view of government strategies and their effects on the relationships between the nursing and medical professions. 
 The influence of American health care policies and their partial introduction into primary health care in New Zealand is traversed in some detail, together with the experiences of health reform in several other countries. 
 Post election 1999, the thesis considers the effect of change of political direction consequent upon the election of a Labour Coalition government and concludes that the removal of the neo-liberal ethic by Labour may terminate entrepreneurial opportunities in the nursing profession. The thesis considers the effects of a change to Third Way political direction on national health care policy and on the medical and nursing professions. The data is derived from various texts and transcripts of interviews with 12 health professionals and health commentators. 
 The histories and current relationships between the nursing and medical professions are examined in relation to their claims to be scientific discourses and it is argued that the issue of lack of recognition as a scientific discourse is at the root of nursing&#65533;s perceived inferiority to medicine. This is further expanded in a discussion at the end of the thesis where the structure of the two professions is compared and critiqued. A conclusion is drawn that a potential for action exists to remedy the deficient structure of nursing. The thesis argues that this is the major issue which maintains nursing in the primary sector in a perceived position of inferiority to medicine. 
 The thesis also concludes that the role of government in this triangular relationship is one of manipulation to bring about necessary fundamental change in the delivery of health services at the lowest possible cost without materially strengthening the autonomy of the nursing or the medical professions.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">medical policy</field><field name="subject">health services administration</field><field name="subject">nursing</field><field name="subject">nurse administrators</field><field name="subject">New Zealand government policy</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20061024.145605</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dislocation: deinstitutionalisation in the lives of families of people with an intellectual disability</field><field name="creator">Mirfin-Veitch, Brigit</field><field name="description">This thesis is based on a research project that explored the deinstitutionalisation and eventual closure of a large residential facility for people with an intellectual disability. The thesis is focused on family experiences of deinstitutionalisation in order to understand how families interacted with this major process of social change, and pays specific attention to the role of adult siblings within this context. 
 Unstructured interviews were held with thirty-five families who had family members with an intellectual disability who were being resettled from an institution to alternative disability support services. Families were interviewed at three specific phases during the deinstitutionalisation process: prior to the resettlement of their family member; 1-3 months following resettlement; and one year after resettlement. In keeping with the constructivist paradigm that underpinned this qualitative study, repeated contact with families enabled me to develop some insights into how families made decisions relevant to their family members&#65533; transitions from the institutional environment. 
 The study findings highlight the complexity and heterogeneity of families. While families who participated in this study were found to have shared a similar journey toward institutionalisation, their responses and reactions to deinstitutionalisation and the decision-making associated with such a process were more diverse. My analysis presents the notion that taking a constructivist approach to theorising can facilitate an understanding of how families are influenced in their decision-making with regards to the resettlement of a family member with an intellectual disability. That is, we may be able to gain greater understanding of families&#65533; perceptions of their family members who have an intellectual disability and, subsequently, the decisions that families make regarding the care of that person by exploring the meanings they assign to their world. Ascertaining how families come to construct their understandings of disability is, in my view, critical to responding appropriately to families&#65533; needs within the context of disability support and service provision.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">people with mental disabilities</field><field name="subject">deinstitutionalization</field><field name="subject">community mental health services</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20061024.151035</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The influence of cognitive styles on the interaction with a language instruction CD-ROM : a case study of Malaysian ESL learners</field><field name="creator">Ng, Lee-Luan</field><field name="description">Computer technology has been introduced into the field of language education for more than three decades. However, how individual learners interact with language learning multimedia programmes in different ways is not yet understood. A possible explanation is related to the learners&#65533; variables. The purpose of this study is to investigate the impact of cognitive style, one of these variables, on the language learning process. The participants of this study were a group of ESL university students from Malaysia, who interacted with a language instruction CD-ROM. This study focuses on investigating the interaction process from the students&#65533; perspective. 
 Riding&#65533;s Cognitive Style Analysis, a computer software that measures individual&#65533;s cognitive style, was used to assist in identifying and categorizing students&#65533; cognitive style. Thirty students&#65533; cognitive style was measured before each student spent an average of three hours interacting with a language instruction CD-ROM. This study adopts the case study approach. The primary method of collecting data involved semi-structured interviews with students that focused on their experiences and preferences while interacting with language instruction CD-ROM. Factors that affected the interaction process were then examined to detect whether they were linked to the differences of students&#65533; cognitive orientation. 
 The findings of this study reflect the mixed results that previous researchers have found regarding the effect of cognitive style on students&#65533; language learning experiences. Although responses toward the content, graphics and vocabulary items did partially reflect their cognitive orientation, cognitive style was not the only factor that influenced these students&#65533; behaviours or preferences as they interacted with the language instruction CD-ROM. The study found factors that were not linked to the students&#65533; cognitive styles, yet these also influenced the interaction process. These non-cognitive-style factors consisted of students&#65533; language learning motivation, social presence, and their conception of language learning and cultural influence, which resulted in teacher-centeredness. As a result of these findings, theoretical, research and pedagogical implications are discussed. Recommendations and limitations of the study are also presented.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">English language</field><field name="subject">study and teaching</field><field name="subject">Malaysian students</field><field name="subject">computer-assisted instruction</field><field name="subject">Malaysian speakers</field><field name="subject">foreign speakers</field><field name="subject">cognitive styles</field><field name="subject">psychology of learning</field><field name="subject">educational technology</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20061025.115945</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A classical field treatment of colliding Bose-Einstein condensates</field><field name="creator">Norrie, Adam Anson</field><field name="description">In this thesis we develop a fully quantum-mechanical treatment of collisions between distinct atomic Bose-Einstein condensate wavepackets, with particular emphasis on the incoherently scattered atoms that form s-wave haloes around the condensate wavepackets. Previous theoretical treatments of these systems have been unable to account simultaneously for both the evolution of the halo and the depletion of the condensates, and were therefore restricted to the small scattering limit. Our approach uses the truncated Wigner method, a particular example of the classical field methods familiar from quantum optics. The atomic field is restricted to a low-energy subspace of single-particle states, and the method is applicable even to highly-scattered systems. 
 We present a comprehensive derivation of the truncated Wigner method for ultracold bosonic fields, and discuss in detail the validity regime of the Wigner truncation for inhomogeneous multimode systems. The method gives rise to a set of coupled stochastic differential equations that describe the evolution of a single realisation of the atomic field, and have a form similar to that of the well known Gross-Pitaevskii equation, but with the important difference that the stochastic differential equations include well prescribed quantum fluctuations. To propagate our systems we develop algorithms that allow for highly efficient numerical evolution of realistic experimental collisions. 
 By investigating individual trajectories of the colliding system, we find that the scattering halo is composed of many distinct highly-populated phase grains separated by large numbers of vortices, a behaviour we label quantum turbulence. We develop a spatial averaging method for approximately calculating quantum correlation functions from a single trajectory, and calculate various properties of the halo. Based on these results, we propose a mechanism to explain the observed features of scattering halo formation. We find by using an appropriately extended truncated Wigner approach that three-body recombination events have negligible effect on the collisions. 
 Using an ensemble of trajectories we calculate correlation functions of a particular collisional system to give a rigorous characterisation of the quantum statistics of the field, and obtain results that are remarkably similar to those obtained using single trajectory spatial averaging. For global field quantities, such as the total coherent population, we find that accurate estimates can be achieved using just two trajectories, a result we use to efficiently explore the dependence of the system on key physical parameters. 
 Finally, we apply the truncated Wigner method to collisions between condensates in differing hyperfine states, whose (single-trajectory and ensemble) behaviour we find is qualitatively similar to that of single-component collisions.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bose-Einstein condensation</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20061025.121803</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Aspects of primary education in Samoa : exploring student, parent and teacher perspectives</field><field name="creator">Pereira, Janet Aileen</field><field name="description">This thesis is a qualitative study into aspects of primary education in Samoa. Using student, parent and teacher interview material, I investigate local perspectives on why education is important, what children should learn, how children learn, and what constitutes 'good' teaching. I also look at local perspectives on the place of exams and physical discipline. Fieldwork included classroom observations in rural and urban settings. The thesis documents how children approach learning at school, how teachers go about their work, and how teachers and students interact. 
 This is primarily an ethnographic study and, as such, focuses on local theories and meanings. However, several broader theoretical areas emerge as important. In the thesis I look at: a) the interdependence between different aspects of school (i.e. curriculum, teaching methods, assessment practices, material constraints, etc.); b) the relationship between primary education and the wider society; and c) the increasing impact of globalisation on education. The thesis challenges the belief that patterns of interaction at school undermine primary socialisation. It also challenges the idea that primary education is an alien Western institution. Formal education has been eagerly embraced, co-opted, and reshaped to ensure consistency with local perspectives and practices. 
 Increasingly, global flows impact on education in Samoa. This has created tensions between educational policy and teaching practice. Education policies are profoundly influenced by Western ideologies and practices. These reflect fundamentally different ways of thinking about children, their relationships with adults, teaching, and learning. By contrast, teaching practices in Samoa are consistent with local beliefs, values and understandings, and the material realities of a small, fiscally constrained Pacific nation. Policy initiatives are often met with inertia and resistance. The thesis raises issues as to the role of education in maintaining the status quo versus education as an agent of change. It also points to the increasingly difficulty task of defining what is a relevant education and how this is best achieved.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Samoa</field><field name="subject">primary education</field><field name="subject">teacher-student relationships</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20061025.141215</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Molecular and cellular biology of FGF2 in human ovarian follicles</field><field name="creator">Quennell, Janette Henrietta</field><field name="description">Ovaries maintain and produce functional female gametes, oocytes, for fertilisation. Oocytes develop inside cellular assemblies, the ovarian follicles, before birth and can reside there for up to 50 years in the human. Despite recent inroads, the precise mechanisms of initial follicle recruitment and growth remain unclear. Although the pituitary gonadotrophins play a role in this developmental process, locally produced factors have been implicated strongly in initiation of follicle growth. It is known that fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) is a powerful mitogen for follicular granulosa cells in culture and initial studies undertaken in this project were successful in detecting FGF2 gene expression in ovarian biopsies from fertile healthy women. To further elucidate which cells were expressing FGF2, laser microdissection was employed to isolate differentially staged follicle populations. Real-time RT-PCR was used to quantify mRNA in relation to follicle development. Decreasing levels of FGF2 expression were detected as follicles developed. Non-radioactive in situ hybridisation confirmed FGF2 mRNA localisation in granulosa cells of preantral follicles. FGF2 protein localisation was assessed with immunohistochemistry; two primary antibodies raised against different fragments of human FGF2 were used. Both antibodies detected FGF2 in the oocyte cytoplasm of putative non-growing follicles, whereas only one of the antibodies showed additional reactivity to the basement membrane region of these same follicles. These results suggest different isoforms of FGF2 may localise specifically to different cellular sites. 
 Follicle stimulating hormone receptor (FSHR) gene expression was also investigated in follicles using laser microdissection, real-time RT-PCR and in situ hybridisation. FSHR mRNA was detected in all follicle populations, including the smallest putative non-growing follicles. Disparity to other published works was attributed to the position of primer annealing, and thus the ability to detect alternatively spliced transcripts. 
 In conclusion, the work presented here provides evidence that FGF2 and FSHR are present in small follicles and that their actions may be stimulatory or inhibitory to initial follicle recruitment.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ovaries</field><field name="subject">epithelium</field><field name="subject">microbiology</field><field name="subject">cytology</field><field name="subject">fibroblast growth factors</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20061025.142115</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Growth, structure, and desalination of refreezing cracks in sea ice</field><field name="creator">Petrich, Christian</field><field name="description">The aim of this study is to characterise the structure of refrozen cracks, and to deduce the details of their formation. Surveys and experiments are conducted on straight-sided, linear, refrozen cracks of width 80 mm to 340 mm in land-fast first-year sea ice in McMurdo Sound, Antarctica. Refreezing of cracks is simulated analytically, and with a numerical fluid dynamics model of brine movement in the porous sea ice and in the ocean. Systematic arch-shaped patterns of inclusions, upstream-growing crystals, and two-dimensional variations in salinity are identified in completely and partially refrozen, natural cracks, and in artificial cracks. 
 Using a two-dimensional thermistor array, a relationship between the development of the sea ice structure and the temperature records is found, which identifies the transition from the porous, skeletal layer to consolidated ice in artificial cracks. A two-dimensional analytical model is developed that predicts the measured thickness of consolidated ice in refreezing cracks for this study and for the studies of others. From a heat balance within the refreezing cracks, it is concluded that some of the experiments were conducted in the presence of a negative ocean heat flux. A two-dimensional thermistor array beneath the ice-water interface of a refreezing crack provides evidence for sporadic, cold temperature, advective events at night. 
 A two-dimensional, numerical fluid dynamics model based on the finite volume method is developed to simulate desalination and fluid flow in refreezing cracks. This requires a permeability-porosity relationship for sea ice, which is deduced from data of other groups, combined with the numerical model. To make comparisons among data sets, an analytical approximation is derived for the relationship between connected pore space and total pore space of a random porous medium, based on a Monte Carlo model that is adapted to the crystal structure of sea ice. The permeability-porosity relationship derived in this study is in good agreement with permeability functions published recently. 
 The refreezing of cracks simulated with the numerical fluid dynamics model is consistent with experiments and with the analytical model. In addition, the numerical model simulates the high porosity, arch-shaped freezing front and inclusion structure. Supercooling of the liquid is found to cause excessive heat loss in the simulation. Since a large oceanic heat flux was not observed in the experimental heat balance of refreezing slots, it is suggested that this indicates platelet ice formation or frazil ice formation at the vertical crack interface in Antarctic experiments.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">sea ice</field><field name="subject">Antarctica</field><field name="subject">McMurdo Sound</field><field name="subject">fluid dynamics</field><field name="subject">Monte Carlo method</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20061025.143344</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Invertebrate diversity and vegetation heterogeneity : plant-invertebrate relationships in indigenous New Zealand grasslands</field><field name="creator">Rate, Stephen R.</field><field name="description">Spatial heterogeneity of the environment, as measured by floral diversity, composition and structure, is known to influence the distribution and diversity of invertebrates. Heterogeneity brought about by anthropogenic disturbance may be a threat to invertebrate diversity. This thesis investigates the impacts of vegetation heterogeneity at a range of scales on the diversity of invertebrate populations in modified high-altitude indigenous grasslands on the Rock and Pillar Range, Central Otago. 
 Invertebrates were sampled in and on the edges of snow tussock fragments to assess whether species richness increased systematically with fragment area. Invertebrate composition was poorly related to fragment area, plant composition and environmental variables. Taxon richness, abundance and/or diversity for three invertebrate groups increased as fragment area decreased, perhaps reflecting an influx of species from the surrounding matrix. For snow tussock leaf invertebrates in autumn, richness and abundance were at least two times lower in tussocks exposed to the wind than those in the centre of fragments, suggesting selection of habitat may be based on microclimatic characteristics. 
 Invertebrates were sampled from the bases of tussocks after they were clipped to simulate three levels of vertebrate grazing. Invertebrate community composition differed between sites and sampling dates but was unaffected by clipping treatment. At the higher altitude site invertebrate abundance was 1.45 times greater and Shannon-Wiener diversity (H&#65533;) 1.22 times lower than at the lower altitude site. The latter sampling date had higher abundance (2.12 times) and taxon richness (1.14 times) than the earlier date. 
 Pitfall-trapped invertebrates in cushionfield, herbfield and snow tussock differed in community composition and often by taxon richness, abundance and diversity. Across habitats, plant composition, plant diversity and some environmental variables were correlated with invertebrate variables, but could not be separated from vegetation type. 
 The invertebrates collected in the course of the study are listed. Four Phyla, eight Classes, 24 orders and over 300 taxa were recorded. Almost all taxa are endemic and many have limited distributions and/or are undescribed. A species list is provided with collection altitude, method and habitat type. 
 Invertebrate assemblages from sites differing in altitude, vegetation type and level of habitat modification on the Rock and Pillar Range are compared. Sites differed in species composition and rank orders of abundance and richness. At lower elevations, invertebrate richness was at least 25% less, and standardised trap abundance at least 44% less, than that at the highest elevation. Richness and abundance of exotic invertebrates decreased with increasing altitude. 
 This thesis highlights several points concerning the study of grassland invertebrates and heterogeneity on the Rock and Pillar Range. First, there are differences in invertebrate assemblages at a range of scales. Conserving invertebrate diversity will therefore require altitudinal sequences and different habitat types, including disturbed areas. At high elevations, tussock habitat may be disproportionately important due to its relative rarity. Second, the effects of disturbance on invertebrates were only visible at large spatial scales. Third, there is a paucity of research on New Zealand invertebrates, especially in regard to terrestrial disturbance, which has resulted in a shortfall of biological, distributional, taxonomic and ecological knowledge.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">invertebrates</field><field name="subject">invertebrate populations</field><field name="subject">grassland</field><field name="subject">population biology</field><field name="subject">Rock and Pillar Range</field><field name="subject">sampling (statistics)</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20061025.144447</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Intimate partner violence : gender symmetry and the victim perpetrator overlap</field><field name="creator">Robertson, Kirsten Jane</field><field name="description">This study addressed substantial limitations in the literature pertaining to intimate partner violence (IPV). In particular, I addressed the gender symmetry debate, and identified factors associated with the dynamics of violent relationships by examining the correlates related to perpetrating and suffering IPV for both men and women. Finally, I examined attitudes towards IPV, communication behaviour, and conflict management techniques as a function of abuse history. Participants were recruited from three samples of the New Zealand population (student, general, and incarcerated). The inclusion of an incarcerated sample enabled the examination of more severe, frequent and injurious violence than is typically experienced within the student and general samples. 
 There were three phases to the study. The first phase explored incidence rates and psychological correlates of IPV. As expected, the incidence of IPV was highest within the incarcerated sample (Chapter 5). Of greater significance, the incidence of IPV was similar for males and females, with the majority of violence being bi-directional (Chapters 4 &amp; 5). Moreover, the psychological correlates associated with IPV were similar for perpetrators and victims, and males and females (Chapters 4 &amp; 5). 
 Due to the bi-directional nature of IPV, analyses presented in Chapters 4 and 5 were limited by the categorisation of participants as both perpetrators and victims. In Chapter 6, I overcame this limitation. The attitudes of victims were examined separately to individuals experiencing bi-directional violence. Validating the findings of Chapters 4 and 5, the attitudes and behaviours of victims and perpetrators were similar. These included being more hostile and negative towards others and ones&#65533; partner, being more controlling, and reporting more communication problems. I also further explored gender symmetry in IPV. Male and female IPV was found to be similar in frequency, severity, and similarly associated with control. However, the type of acts perpetrated differed across gender. 
 During the second and third phase of the study, I further examined participants&#65533; communication behaviour (Chapter 7), conflict behaviour, and attitudes (Chapter 8). Findings revealed that perpetrators and victims employed less facilitative and polite linguistic devices (Chapter 7) and reported fewer skills for dealing with conflict (Chapter 8) than did other individuals. An examination of attitudes towards IPV revealed males and females had similar attitudes and were more condoning of female, than male-perpetrated IPV. Moreover, individuals with a history of IPV were the most condoning of violence. Additionally, a number of correlates associated with experiencing IPV were also associated with attitudes condoning IPV (Chapter 8). 
 Overall, the findings revealed IPV to be bi-directional and gender symmetrical. Male and female IPV was similar in incidence, severity, and injury. Furthermore, the psychological correlates associated with IPV were similar for men and women, and perpetrators and victims. Individuals with a history of IPV were more controlling, hostile towards others, more condoning of IPV, employed less positive communication styles, and lacked skills for dealing with conflict. In light of these findings, suggestions are offered for violence prevention initiatives in the discussion sections of each chapter and in the final chapter (Chapter 9).</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">marital violence</field><field name="subject">female offenders</field><field name="subject">psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20061025.151154</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sleep, alertness, performance and fatigue management in extended duration and irregular night shift workers</field><field name="creator">Purnell, Melissa T.</field><field name="description">Extended duration and irregularly planned overnight shifts are becoming frequent features of current working time arrangements. However, there is great concern about the detrimental effect that these shifts are likely to have on the sleep, performance and fatigue levels of workers. To date, the empirical evidence regarding the effects of extended and irregular overnight shifts is sparse and workers have rarely been followed up longer term to assess possible changes over time. Because these types of overnight shifts are being introduced into transport settings such as aviation and shipping where safe and productive operations are paramount, there is a real imperative to examine and trial workplace-based methods aimed at counteracting night shift related fatigue and performance deficits. Taking short duration naps on the nightshift at work is one potential countermeasure that has shown promise in the laboratory but has yet to be examined in any real-world setting under conditions of extended duration or irregular night work. This thesis takes up these issues in a series of four empirical workplace-based studies. 
 The impact of the introduction of regularly planned 12 h day and overnight shifts was examined on three occasions via questionnaire in a group of aircraft maintenance engineers, once before the change, and twice after the change from 8 h shifts. The results showed that high levels of acute fatigue on the 12 h night shifts and high chronic fatigue levels were common, and were strongly associated with poor overall job performance, poor safety of job performance, and longer recovery times, effects that persisted over time. Of major concern was the finding that over half of the engineers reported having nodded off while driving home from their extended overnight shifts. The impact of irregularly planned 8 h overnight shifts worked by cargo handlers in a shipping container terminal was also examined via self-report questionnaire. The findings revealed significant detrimental impacts on sleep, fatigue levels and performance at work. High fatigue levels were strongly associated with poor self-rated performance output and safety of performance at work on the overnight shifts. 
 The primary focus of this thesis was to evaluate the effect of a scheduled 20 min nap opportunity taken in these two fully operational workplaces during the night shift on sleep, performance and alertness. Sleep was achieved by 50 to 59% of workers. Speed of performance in 24 male aircraft maintenance engineers on a vigilance task was significantly faster at the end of a 12 h overnight shift that had contained sleep during the nap compared to the control condition. There was no such effect of the nap on the performance of 22 cargo handlers working impromptu 8 h shifts in a shipping container terminal. However, the duration of sleep obtained by the 8 h workers was shorter in comparison and was likely to have been undermined by the high noise levels around the nap facility and time pressures related to the organisation of work. Actigraphy data recorded from all subjects showed that subsequent daytime sleep was not disrupted by the night shift nap opportunity. Overall, the most interesting findings were that simply being tired and presented with a sleep opportunity during the night shift did not guarantee either sleep, or recovery but that sleep, as opposed to rest, was necessary for the benefits to performance to be fully realised. 
 These findings have shown for the first time that management of fatigue associated with extended duration night work can be achieved in some instances by the use of a short duration nap taken in the workplace on the night shift. However, operationalizing in-situ napping on the night shift has a range of organisational influences that must be considered for the potential of such a strategy to be fully harnessed.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">sleep deprivation</field><field name="subject">shift systems</field><field name="subject">employees</field><field name="subject">health and hygiene</field><field name="subject">fatigue</field><field name="subject">attention</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20061030.085607</field></doc><doc><field name="title">False memories produced by children and adults in the DRM paradigm</field><field name="creator">Sugrue, Katrina Joan</field><field name="description">The primary objective of the present thesis was to investigate factors that influence the creation of false memories using the Deese-Roediger-McDermott (DRM) paradigm. The experimental research addressed the effect of age, list length, and list content on the magnitude of the DRM illusion with a view to testing assumptions derived from activation-monitoring theory and Fuzzy Trace Theory. In the first experiment, I wanted to determine whether the DRM paradigm is appropriate for use with New Zealand English-speaking adults. In addition, Experiment 1 was designed to assess the effect of prior recall on recognition performance. To answer these questions, I assigned half of the participants to a recall-plus-recognition condition and the remaining participants to a recognition-only condition. Rates of false recall and recognition were comparable to those reported in the literature, which suggested that the task is suitable for use with New Zealand adults. Furthermore, prior recall enhanced correct recognition but it did not affect false recognition. In Experiment 2, I examined how manipulations of list-length affected children and adults' susceptibility to the DRM illusion. Ten-year-olds and adults studied eight lists of either 7 or 14 words. In the 14-word condition, adults falsely recalled more critical targets than children; however, in the 7-word condition, there was no age difference in false recall. In addition, adults falsely recognised a greater proportion of critical targets than children, however, this effect was not dependent on the length of the study list. In Experiments 3A and 3B, I examined whether presenting highly familiar study materials would enhance children's susceptibility to false memories. Ten-year-old children and adults studied four standard DRM lists, four new lists that centred on 'child-friendly' concepts, such as birthday and school (CF lists), and four lists derived from child word-association norms. In both experiments, there was no age difference in rates of false recall. In addition, presenting material that was deemed more developmentally appropriate did not enhance children's susceptibility to false memories relative to adults. In Experiment 4, I introduced a post-recall phase to examine why the DRM illusion is less likely to occur when short lists are presented and when the materials are child-friendly. During the post-recall phase, participants were asked to report any other words that they had thought of during the presentation or recall of the study lists. Thinking about the target word, but remembering that it had not been presented, could not account for decreased levels of false recall in the short-list condition. Similarly, with the CF lists, it appeared that the list items were less likely to activate the critical target for both children and adults. In the final three experiments, I explored the assumptions outlined in activation-monitoring theory and fuzzy-trace theory to determine which model provided the best account of the findings obtained to date. To explore the activation-monitoring account, children and adults completed word association tasks. To explore fuzzy-trace theory, children and adults were given a gist extraction task where they had to identify the critical targets associated with each list. Collectively, the results of the present thesis fit more comfortably within an activation-monitoring framework than they do within the fuzzy-trace framework. Although the precise mechanisms underlying the DRM illusion have yet to be elucidated, the present findings suggest that gist extraction, activation processes, and source monitoring each play a substantial role in mediating false memory levels.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">false memory syndrome</field><field name="subject">memory in children</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20060523.162905</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Values in space and time : a framework for understanding and linking multiple cultural values in landscapes</field><field name="creator">Stephenson, Janet</field><field name="description">When new development threatens a valued landscape it is not just the physical landscape that is being affected, but the collective memories, meanings and identities that the landscape holds. Planning theory and practice currently offer relatively little guidance as to how to address meaning and value, particularly at a landscape scale. 
 Recent literature from a variety of disciplines has stressed the need to develop holistic models of understanding landscape. Particular emphasis has been laid on the absence of integration of disciplinary approaches, and the need to involve communities in defining what is important and distinctive about their own landscapes. 
 The thesis sets out to develop a conceptual framework to assist in understanding multiple cultural values in landscapes. Although the primary focus of the research is to address the perceived shortcomings in planning theory and practice, its potential relevance to inter-disciplinary work also forms a major component of the research approach. 
 Values in landscapes include those expressed by associated communities and those identified through a variety of disciplinary approaches. Using case studies, the research explores the nature and range of landscape values as expressed by those with special associations with particular landscapes. It also examines the nature of the meanings and values ascribed by disciplines with an interest in landscape, and how various disciplines model landscape so as to convey these values. 
 Analysis of these findings generates a landscape framework consisting of two related models. The Cultural Values Model offers a conceptual structure with which to consider the surface and embedded values of landscapes in terms of forms, practices and relationships. The Dimensional Landscape Model provides a structured way of linking expressed values to the landscape, using dimensional concepts of nodes, networks, spaces, webs and layers. 
 The landscape framework is found to be useful not only for generating a comprehensive picture of key landscape values, but also in offering an integrated approach that has utility both for planners and for other landscape-related disciplines.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">space and time</field><field name="subject">geographical perception</field><field name="subject">human geography</field><field name="subject">New Zealand landscape</field><field name="subject">social aspects</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20061030.154114</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Discursive analysis of a television advertising campaign : obliged to be healthy</field><field name="creator">Jardine, Andrew</field><field name="description">This thesis describes and demonstrates the use of discourse analysis as a means of facilitating critical awareness and stimulating research practice within a consumer research context. In a generic sense, discourse analysis applies to a range of semiotic methods for studying text (including talk, writing and visual images), where the objective is to gain insight into both the meanings of a text and what it signifies. Emphasis is placed on the constructive use of language, where texts of various kinds are said to construct our social world. Two approaches to discourse analysis are detailed. 
 Firstly, Foucauldian discourse analysis is shown to operate more generally and globally as a social and cultural resource that underpins many human endeavours and activities. Under this approach, discourses are seen as resources that interact with one another. Foucauldian discourse analysis is therefore quite a different enterprise from the finer-grained investigation of talk and texts that is undertaken in discourse analysis and discursive psychology. Instead, discourses are treated as being dynamic in nature, having the ability to mutate over time, and gain dominance in certain settings and cultural locations. Discourse analysis under this approach facilitates critical awareness because it seeks to uncover the ways in which such discourses produce, maintain and constrain people within particular positions and relationships. 
 Secondly, a discursive psychological approach to discourse analysis focuses on the strategic use of discourse within a particular piece of text, where interaction and the acknowledgement of such interaction by the researcher underscores the importance of language and the ways that people purposefully and strategically use language to achieve particular outcomes or goals. A discursive psychological approach focuses upon discursive practices and constructions, rather than cognitive-perceptual processes. A discourse analytic approach is therefore able to potentially redefine and stimulate current research practice. Psychological phenomena that might have traditionally been framed and studied as 'cognitive' and 'internal' processes can be recast as particular situated discursive accomplishments that people are able to draw upon. Because analysis is not subject to what may be termed 'cognitive reductionism' (where attempts to explain social events and processes are made entirely by reference to events and structures in the mental processes of individuals), a discursive analytic approach suggests new insights into current research practice. 
 The specific context for analysis within this thesis is provided by an advertising campaign for Xenical, a pharmaceutical product promoted as a treatment for obesity. Xenical was one of the first prescription medications to be marketed directly to consumers in New Zealand via the use of direct-to-consumer advertising (DTCA), a relatively recent form of marketing communication. The Xenical advertising campaign created both controversy and high awareness for the product. Contributing to this controversy was the overt use of DTCA itself, which critics suggest influences patient demand, encourages the use of expensive and sometimes unnecessary medications and in effect, 'creates' disease. As argued here, positioning obesity as a disease in effect justifies (warrants) the pharmaceutical industry&#65533;s efforts to offer medical solutions. 
 In addition to the use of DTCA, the nature of the Xenical advertisements was also controversial. Critics suggested that the Xenical advertisements were based upon negative emotions, associating the state of being overweight with feelings of sadness, shame and embarrassment. These 'emotions' become a key subject in the current study. But in this thesis, rather than viewing such emotions as internal and mental phenomena, the use of discourse analysis focuses on the socio-cultural nature of emotions. Discourse analysis is concerned with uncovering the ways in which bodily sensations are rendered into language and what the subsequent implications for the speaker might be as a result. 
 Using the advertising campaign for Xenical as context then, discourse analysis is used as a research approach to examine the television advertisements from multiple perspectives. Analysis includes the study of the casting tapes that were used by the advertising agency as source material to inform the creative strategy for the advertisements. In addition, one of the Xenical advertisements is deconstructed in greater detail, outlining the effects of visual and aural discourses that weave together to convey meaning within the advertisement. Analysis is informed by interviews conducted with the creative director of the advertisements as well as the marketing manger for Xenical. Discourse analysis allows us to examine the ways in which the producers of an advertisement purposefully (although perhaps unknowingly) create particular effects for strategic reasons, and how advertisements may be subsequently read as a consequence. The final analysis is based on a reader-response to the advertising campaign. Analysis focuses on the &#65533;emotional&#65533; talk contained within a particular interview, and how talk functions as performance. Rather than treating emotional talk as a description or reflection of inner psychological worlds, discourse analysis examines participant talk in terms of its content and meanings and how participants use such talk to construct their worlds. Although often overlooked within traditional forms of consumer research, the importance of representing social interaction through detailed interview transcripts is demonstrated, underscoring the analysis provided. Results suggest that the language of description and the methods of data capture that are typically utilised within consumer research are not able to provide an accurate account of the external world. This is because the only way we can know our world is always going to be mediated by and through language, and as a consequence, the meanings and interpretations available to us are never going to be transparent or neutral representations. 
 The findings suggested in this thesis are intended as a starting point for subsequent research into the study of language in use and human meaning making within advertising and consumer research environments. Because consumer research has borrowed heavily from the social sciences and particularly from psychology, then it is important that researchers within the discipline re-examine many of the psychological topics that we commonly take for granted by considering the way such talk and text is used in action. Discourse analysis provides a research approach that enables such a re-examination.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">television advertising</field><field name="subject">advertising campaigns</field><field name="subject">health products</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20061101.114209</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Speaking selves : dialogue and identity in Milton&#65533;s major poems</field><field name="creator">Liebert, Elisabeth Mary</field><field name="description">In his Dialogue on the State of a Christian Man (1597), William Perkins articulated the popular early-modern understanding that the individual is a "double person" organised under "spiritual" and "temporal" regiments. In the one, he is a person "under Christ" and must endeavour to become Christ-like; in the other, he is a person "in respect of" others and bound to fulfil his duties towards them. This early-modern self, governed by relationships and the obligations they entail, was profoundly vulnerable to the formative influence of speech, for relationships themselves were in part created and sustained through social dialogue. Similarly, the individual could hope to become "a person...under Christ" only by hearing spiritual speech - Scripture preached or read, or the "secret soule-whisperings" of the Spirit. The capacity of speech to effect real and lasting change in the auditor was a commonplace in seventeenth-century England: the conscious crafting of identity, dramatised by Stephen Greenblatt in Renaissance Self-Fashioning, occurred daily in domestic and social transactions, in the exchange of civilities, the use of apostrophe, and strategies of praise. It happened when friends or strangers met, when host greeted guest, or the signatory to a letter penned vocatives that defined his addressee. It lacked a sense of high drama but was nonetheless calculated and effective. 
 Speaking Selves proposes that examining the impact of speech upon the "double person" not only contributes to our understanding of selfhood in the seventeenth century, but also, and more importantly, leads to new insights into some of that century&#65533;s greatest literary artefacts: Paradise Lost, Paradise Regained, and Samson Agonistes. The first chapter turns to conduct manuals and conversion narratives, to speech-act theory and discourse analysis, and draws out those verbal strategies that contributed to the organisation of social and spiritual selves. Chapter 2 turns to Paradise Lost and traces the Father&#65533;s gradual revelation to the Son, through apostrophe, how he is to reflect, how enact the divine being whose visible and verbal expression he is. Chapter 3 discusses advice on address behaviour in seventeenth-century marriage treatises; it reveals the positive contribution of generous apostrophe and verbal mirroring to Adam and Eve&#65533;s Edenic marriage. The conversational dyads in heaven and prelapsarian Eden enact positive identities for their collocutors. Satan, however, begetting himself by diabolical speech-act, discovers the ability of words to dismantle the identity of others. Chapter 4 traces the development of his deceptive strategies, drawing attention to his wilful misrepresentation of social identity as a means to pervert the spiritual identity of his collocutor. The final chapter explores the reorganisation of the complex social-spiritual person in the postlapsarian world. We watch the protagonist of Samson discriminate between the many voices that attempt to impose upon him their own understanding of selfhood. Drawing on spiritual autobiographies as structurally and thematically analogous to Milton&#65533;s drama, this final chapter traces the inward plot of Samson as its fallen hero redefines identity and rediscovers the "intimate impulse" of the Spirit that alone can complete the reorganisation of the spiritual self.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">John Milton (1608-1674)</field><field name="subject">dialogue in literature</field><field name="subject">identity (psychology) in literature</field><field name="subject">self in literature</field><field name="subject">religion in literature</field><field name="subject">Christianity in literature</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20061106.160106</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The emergence of the representational mind</field><field name="creator">Walker, Rebecca</field><field name="description">Theory of mind has been described in philosophical and psychological literature as "folk psychology", and is the tacit understanding that our behaviour is driven by our thoughts, desires and beliefs (Wellman, Cross, &amp; Watson, 2001). Children are widely considered to have attained theory of mind understanding when they are able to pass the test of false belief understanding devised by Wimmer and Perner (1983), at around 4 years of age. There are many theories as to how a child comes to hold a folk psychology, including innate modularism (Leslie, 1987, 1988, 1994), theory change (Gopnik &amp; Wellman 1992), developing representational understanding (Perner, 1991, 1995, 2000), and experiential understanding developed in a socio-linguisitic context (Nelson, 1996). In addition, theory of mind has been linked to the development of symbolic understanding (Deloache &amp; Smith, 1999; Perner, 1991), pretend play (Leslie, 1987; Taylor &amp; Carlson, 1997; Youngblade &amp; Dunn, 1993), language (Astington &amp; Jenkins, 1999; Nelson, 1996; Olson, 1988) and executive function (e.g. Hughes, 1998a; Kochanska et al., 1996; Reed et al., 1984). The present study sought to bring together these diverse findings and to attempt to provide an integrated account of the emergence of theory of mind understanding during the preschool years. Sixty-four New Zealand children were assessed on their mental state understanding, deceptive abilities, symbolic functioning, language, and executive skills, when they were aged 30, 36, 42 and 48 months of age. 
 There were a number of key findings in the present study. Language was a powerful predictor of false belief performance both within and across time, and was also related to many of the other variables included in the study. Performance on the scale model test of symbolic functioning was related across time to children&#65533;s concurrent and later false belief understanding. Scale model performance was also intertwined in a bidirectional relationship with language, and language appeared to play an increasingly important role in mediating the relationship with false belief understanding across time. False belief understanding and scale model performance were also related within and across time to executive function. There was evidence to suggest that the importance of working memory was due to its role in conflict inhibition. Although deception has sometimes been posited to be a precocious manifestation of theory of mind (Chandler, Fritz, &amp; Hala, 1989), in the present study deceptive ability lagged false belief understanding. Furthermore, false belief understanding was related to children&#65533;s subsequent (but not earlier) responses to a protagonist&#65533;s intention. This supports the hypothesis that false belief understanding allows a qualitative change in the execution of deception, whereby children can move from simple physical strategies to more sophisticated mentalist strategies. Overall, the present study provides some evidence to suggest that symbolic functioning, language, and later theory of mind may form part of a single developing skill set of symbolic representation. In dynamic interaction with social understanding, and supported by cognitive abilities such as executive function, and the socio-linguistic context, it is argued that understanding of one&#65533;s own and other minds emerges. Children&#65533;s ability to solve the false belief problem at 4 years of age is presented as a milestone on a developmental continuum of social understanding.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cognition in children</field><field name="subject">thought and thinking</field><field name="subject">philosophy of mind</field><field name="subject">ethnopsychology</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20061106.161621</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Similarities and differences in New Zealand school uniforms : issues of identity</field><field name="creator">Webster, Elaine Irene</field><field name="description">Dress and appearance constitute the visual realm in the dialectic of identity construction and are powerful communicators in this process, since dress and appearance are the symbolic means by which we locate ourselves and others through interaction within social contexts. Dress is used to differentiate and create boundaries for group belonging and exclusion, and in the uniform has been understood to have a capacity to suppress individuality and to identify the wearer with objectives beyond the self. Adolescence is a time of intense identity work and in New Zealand coincides with secondary schooling during which school uniforms are usually worn. Is freedom in dress necessary for development of personal identity? 
 The effects of same-dressing on identity development in adolescence were investigated in the context of the history, practice, and meanings of school uniform in New Zealand secondary schools. This was investigated through a nationwide survey, analysis of selected school photographs and records, interviews with students, review of legal and bureaucratic structures supporting the practice, and review of the literature of school uniforms, and education and social history of New Zealand. A combination of qualitative and quantitative methods contributed to analysis of both dress practices in wider New Zealand contexts, and more personal use of dress in the formation of personal identity. Analysis of school uniforms as mechanisms of power, constituting both the student and the self, drew on symbolic interactionist theory and on Foucault&#65533;s later interpretations of power, while also linking material culture and social structures. 
 New Zealand has a strong and continuing tradition of school uniform in secondary schools, yet this practice is characterised by change, variety, and differences, challenging the sameness which uniforms are supposed to embody. Meanings and functions of uniforms have changed considerably over the twentieth century, evolving through extreme and diverse expressions of the expectations of social, political, and education systems towards their young people, and mediated in turn by students themselves. While school uniforms both manifest and mediate the power of the school over the bodies of children, the power embodied in uniforms is not always and only a repressive power, but is also a generative, productive power. Students described uniforms as a form of shelter and protection, embodying belonging and participation in the school and a projected future of success and engagement in adult society and work. Uniforms also maintained a breadth of possibilities consistent with a fluid class system and egalitarian ideals of New Zealand society. 
 While students believed self-expression essential for the formation of a self, they believed this need could be met through the use of minor differences in uniforms, while uniforms allowed them to retain the advantages of group belonging. Schools allowing some personal expression effectively strengthened the sense of belonging and participation, by maintaining the individual in positive relation to the group. The interaction that creates a self consists in symbols, involving meanings, appearances, and communication: differences and similarities from part of these complex interactions.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">high school students</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">uniforms</field><field name="subject">clothing and dress</field><field name="subject">social aspects</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20061108.143726</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Refining an entrepreneurial orientation and its impact on driving markets behaviours</field><field name="creator">Zortea, Elisabeth</field><field name="description">Firms adopting an entrepreneurial orientation (EO) can be described as firms that take risks, are proactive in pursuing opportunities, compete aggressively with their industry rivals, launch products that change market boundaries and market behaviour, and grant employees autonomy to facilitate the generation of such radical innovation. Although an EO has been widely investigated in entrepreneurship research, only a few attempts have been undertaken to refine and broaden the EO construct since its development in the early 1980s. The two characteristics competitive aggressiveness and autonomy have only recently been added to an EO. This thesis argues that more components should be incorporated to achieve a more comprehensive EO construct: opportunity recognition, growth commitment and organisational learning. 
 The current thesis suggests that an EO, as it is currently acknowledged in the literature, is in need of further refinement. More specifically, a detailed examination of the construct reveals several inconsistencies such as equivocal EO definitions (actual entrepreneurial behaviours and practices vs. propensities to act entrepreneurially), ambiguous EO components and poorly operationalised scales. Furthermore, the psychometric properties of an EO have not been clearly specified (unidimensional vs. multidimensional, formative vs. reflexive). Due to these discrepancies, this thesis calls for a clearer and more comprehensive discussion of an EO along with a more valid EO scale. 
 One of the consequences of an EO as presented in this thesis is that of driving markets. A firm&#65533;s ability to drive markets is considered a vital means with which to achieve firm success and long-term survival. Firms that drive markets engage in radical innovation, shape the needs of current and future customers, and change the market structure they are operating in. Unfortunately, however, firms often focus too closely on current customers and their needs, competitors and market conditions - that is, are market-driven. Instead of altering the composition of a market and/or the behaviours of market players, market-driven firms work within the confines of their markets, promoting incremental innovation rather than radical innovation. 
 Despite the importance of driving markets behaviours for firm success, there is little theoretical and empirical evidence to support how driving markets behaviours can be achieved. In order to address this gap, this thesis calls upon an EO as one possible antecedent of driving markets behaviours. Thus, following the development of an improved EO construct, this thesis then moves to establish a theoretical framework that describes an EO and its impact on driving markets/market-driven behaviours. To help establish an EO&#65533;s predictive validity, the framework is further enriched by adding a market orientation (MO), thereby comparing and contrasting both an EO and a MO in relation to driving markets and market-driven behaviours 
 The data used for this research is based upon a study of 836 New Zealand firms. Confirmatory factor analysis is used to test for unidimensionality and to set up stable measurement models for all constructs in question. Structural equation modeling is then applied to examine an EO&#65533;s psychometric properties and the relationship between an EO, a MO and driving markets/market-driven behaviours. The findings indicate that an EO is a multidimensional and formative construct, yet with only four contributing dimensions (R&amp;D, proactiveness, autonomy, and growth commitment). It is further shown that an EO has a very strong direct impact on driving markets behaviours and also influences such behaviours considerably more than a MO. The same can be said about an EO&#65533;s effect on market-driven behaviours. 
 A MO&#65533;s direct impact on driving markets/market-driven behaviours is somewhat diminished by the suppressive negative effects of the responsiveness dimension of the MO construct, particularly on driving markets behaviours. Subsequent analysis shows that unlike an EO, a MO does not lead to driving markets behaviours, but rather to market-driven behaviours. In contrast, an EO is found to represent a more balanced approach, since it triggers both driving markets and market-driven behaviours.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">entrepreneurship</field><field name="subject">marketing</field><field name="subject">management</field><field name="subject">New Zealand case studies</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20061108.145532</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Te mana Maori : Te tatari i nga korero parau</field><field name="creator">Hokowhitu, Brendan J.</field><field name="description">This thesis has three primary objectives: to deconstruct the genealogical representation of Maori as a physical, unintelligent and savage people, to examine the role that education, and particularly physical education has played in perpetuating these representations by channelling Maori into physical curriculum areas, and to provide a functional kaupapa Maori philosophy of health and physical education.
	Postmodern theory underpins this theses because it encourages the search for multiple truths. In the colonial context, specifically, it provides an ideal tool by which to deconstruct the supposedly objective and preordained single truths of the colonisers. As I demonstrate, these single truths proved to be politically motivated and false. I also employ a Foucauldian understanding of European history to describe how European bourgeois nationalism and normalisation mutated into biopower, where the normalised Self was able to control, limit, describe and kill the Other.
	Travellers, missionaries and settlers transposed biopower from Europe to colonial New Zealand. Later, descriptions of the Other - or rather the juxtapositioning of the Self next to depictions of the primitive/anti Other - by anthropologists and historians aided this process. For the benefit of enlightened liberals, colonisation in New Zealand required a specific rhetoric to recast ruthless aspects of the process as mere anomalies on the road to Utopia. The modernist Western world validated colonisation under the guises of humanism and progress: the savage, primitive, pre-philosophical Maori provided the perfect contrast against the civilised, mature, philosophical Self. This genealogical representation formed the basis for Pakeha and Maori relations - and continues to do so.
	Representations of Maori as intrinsically unintelligent and physical, framed politically motivated educational policy. Initially, racist educational directives channelled Maori into physical vocations to provide labour for untamed rural New Zealand. In the 1960&#65533;s and &#65533;70&#65533;s, racially biased intelligence test were employed to debiltate Maori students by streaming them into non-academic classes. Later, the so-called empowering rhetoric of the neo-colonial era informed curricula by promoting diluted and sanitised versions of tikanga Maori such as Taha Maori, its physical education offshoot Te Reo Kori, and the current New Zealand Health and Physical Education Curriculum. Promoted under the liberal banner of biculturalism, these initiatives primarily benefited Pakeha and further misrepresented Maori culture as simplistic and irrelevent to contemporary society.
	Deconstructing grand narratives encourages researchers to construct knowledge outside such totalising truths. Thus, the theoretical approach and historical disseminations outlined above provide the foundations for part two of this thesis, which is a contribution towards Maori knowledge. Employing an interpretivist, indepth interviewing and collaborative narrative epistemology, I constructed korero with kaumatua and pakeke. These focus on health and physical education from a Maori position. Subsequent discussion examines certain aspects of each korero, to form a functional Maori philosophy of physical activity delineated by hauora, a Maori notion of holistic health. The discussion also outlines a number of issues surrounding the incorporation of tikanga Maori into mainstream education.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">deconstruction</field><field name="subject">acculturation</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">sports</field><field name="subject">education</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20061214.144753</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Bragg scattering of a solitary-wave condensate and of a Cooper paired Fermi gas</field><field name="creator">Challis, Katharine Jane</field><field name="description">In this thesis we develop Bragg scattering as a tool for probing and manipulating ultra-cold atoms. Our approach is based on a mean-field treatment of degenerate quantum gases. Bose-Einstein condensates are described by the Gross-Pitaevskii equation and degenerate Fermi gases are described by the Bogoliubov-de-Gennes equations. Our work is presented in three inter-related topics. 
 In Part I we investigate Bose-Einstein condensation in a time-averaged orbiting potential trap by deriving solitary-wave dynamical eigenstates of the system. We invoke the quadratic average approximation in which the dynamic effects of the time-dependent potential can be described simply, even when accounting for atomic collisions. By deriving the transformation to the translating frame, dynamical eigenstates of the system are defined and those states are solitary-wave solutions in the laboratory frame, with a particular circular centre-of-mass motion independent of the strength of the collisional interactions. Our treatment in the translating frame is more general than previous treatments that use the rotating frame to define system eigenstates, as the use of the rotating frame restricts eigenstates to those that are cylindrically symmetric about their centre of mass. 
 In Part II we describe Bragg spectroscopy of a condensate with solitary-wave motion. Our approach is based on a momentum space two-bin approximation, derived by Blakie et al. [Journal of Physics B 33:3961, 2000] to describe Bragg scattering of a stationary condensate. To provide an analytic treatment of Bragg scattering of a solitary-wave condensate we use the translating frame, in which the time dependence of the system is described entirely by a time-dependent optical potential. We derive a simplified treatment of the two-bin approximation that provides a physical interpretation of the Bragg spectrum of a solitary-wave condensate. Our methods are applied to Bragg spectroscopy of a condensate in a time-averaged orbiting potential trap, which accelerates as a solitary wave as derived in Part I. The time-averaged orbiting potential trap system is ideal for testing our approximate analytic methods because the micromotion velocity is large compared to the condensate momentum width. 
 In Part III we present a theoretical treatment of Bragg scattering of an ultra-cold Fermi gas. We give the first non-perturbative numerical calculations of the dynamic behaviour of a degenerate Fermi gas subjected to an optical Bragg grating. We observe first order Bragg scattering, familiar from Bragg scattering of stationary Bose-Einstein condensates, and at lower Bragg frequencies we predict scattering of Cooper pairs into a correlated spherical shell of atoms. Correlated-pair scattering is associated with formation of a grating in the pair potential. We give an analytic treatment of Bragg scattering of a homogeneous Fermi gas, and develop a model that reproduces the key features of the correlated-pair Bragg scattering. We discuss the effect of either a trapping potential or finite temperature on the correlated-pair Bragg scattering.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bose-Einstein condensation</field><field name="subject">Electron gas</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20061127.160615</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Regulation of the epithelial sodium channel (ENac) by ubiquitination</field><field name="creator">Wiemuth, Dominik</field><field name="description">The epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) is the central component of the sodium absorption pathway in epithelia. It is critical for sodium homeostasis and blood pressure control, which is demonstrated by rare genetic disorders such as Liddle&#65533;s syndrome and pseudohypoaldosteronism type I, that are associated with hyper- and hypotension, respectively. 
 ENaC is mainly regulated by mechanisms that control the expression of active channels at the cell surface. Ubiquitin ligases of the Nedd4-like family, such as Nedd4 and Nedd4-2 decrease epithelial sodium absorption by binding to and targeting ENaC for endocytosis and degradation. This is most likely achieved by catalyzing the ubiquitination of ENaC. Conversely the serum- and glucocorticoid regulated kinase (SGK) increases ENaC activity. This effect is partly mediated by the interaction of SGK with the ubiquitin ligases Nedd4 and Nedd4-2. SGK is able to bind to both Nedd4 and Nedd4-2, however only Nedd4-2 is phosphorylated by SGK. The phosphorylation of Nedd4-2 inhibits its interaction with ENaC, thus reducing ENaC ubiquitination, thereby increasing surface expression and sodium absorption. 
 Nedd4-like proteins interact with ENaC via their WW-domains. These domains bind PY-motifs (PPXY) present in ENaC subunits. Nedd4 and Nedd4-2 both have four highly similar WW-domains. Previous studies have shown that interaction between Nedd4 and ENaC is mainly mediated by WW-domain 3. SGK also has a PY-motif; therefore it was analyzed whether the WW-domains of Nedd4 and Nedd4-2 mediate binding to SGK. Here, it is shown that single or tandem WW-domains of Nedd4 and Nedd4-2 mediate binding to SGK and that, despite their high similarity, different WW-domains of Nedd4 and Nedd4-2 are involved. These data also suggest that WW-domains 2 and 3 of Nedd4-2 mediate the interaction with SGK in a concerted manner, and that in vitro the phosphorylation of SGK at serine residue 422 increases its affinity for the WW-domains of Nedd4-2. 
 The stimulatory effect of SGK on ENaC activity is partly mediated via Nedd4-2 and will decrease if competition between Nedd4 and Nedd4-2 for binding to SGK occurs. Here it is shown that Nedd4 and Nedd4-2 are located in the same subcellular compartment and that they compete for binding to SGK. 
 Besides its function in the proteasomal degradation pathway ubiquitination is involved in the regulation of membrane protein trafficking, including their endocytosis. ENaC was shown previously to be ubiquitinated. Here, we provide evidence that ENaC can be ubiquitinated differentially depending on its cellular location. Channels residing in the plasma membrane are multiubiquitinated and we suggest that this serves as an internalization signal for ENaC and a control for further trafficking. Cytosolic ENaC is mainly polyubiquitinated, and therefore probably targeted for proteasomal degradation. However, mono- and multiubiquitination of ENaC located within the cytosol is very likely to occur as well. In addition, it is shown that both proteasomal and lysosomal pathways are involved in the regulation of ENaC.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">sodium channels</field><field name="subject">ubiquitin</field><field name="subject">blood pressure regulation</field><field name="subject">epithelium</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20061127.162243</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The evolution of fruit traits in Coprosma and the subtribe Coprosminae</field><field name="creator">Markey, Adrienne Selina</field><field name="description">The flora of New Zealand has evolved largely in the absence of terrestrial mammals, the predominant frugivore guilds being birds and reptiles. The evolution of divergent fruit traits in New Zealand may be a consequence of different selection pressure by these two guilds, and two contrasting putative dispersal syndromes have been proposed for New Zealand fleshy fruited plants. Coprosma (Rubiaceae: subtribe Coprosminae) is a speciose and morphologically diverse genus, which is distributed throughout the South Pacific and which also produces variably coloured drupes. It was selected as a model genus to investigate the evolution of fruit traits within this context. For this purpose, a molecular phylogeny for the subtribe Coprosminae and Coprosma was inferred using parsimony, likelihood and split decomposition analysis on sequences from the 16rps intron of cpDNA and ETS and ITS region of nrDNA. Up to 32 species were included in the subtribal analyses, whilst 53 species of Coprosma were used in subgeneric studies. The basis for the variety of fruit colours seen in New Zealand was determined using histology and pigment extractions. To test the assumption that fruit traits among species evolved in concert under selection from frugivore guilds, fruit shape, size and nutrient composition were determined in order to test predictions that these would co-vary with fruit colour. 
 In the Coprosminae, fleshy drupes have arisen from dry fruited schizocarps and with two possible reversals to semi-dry drupes. Within Coprosma, fruit colour was found to be evolutionarily labile and varied both among and within lineages, particularly within two main groups where fruit colour had shifted from orange to blue and white, or red, pink and black colours respectively. The evolution of novel (non-orange) fruit colours was restricted to New Zealand, as was the small-leaved, divaricate growth form, the combination of which has been associated with a putative reptile dispersal syndrome. Several trans-oceanic dispersals out of New Zealand were also inferred from the phylogeny, these extending into Australia, New Guinea and Hawai&#65533;i. In these instances, fruit colour did not appear change markedly after establishment in a new country. Within New Zealand, fruit sizes were found to vary with colour as predicted, although the majority of species produced small (&lt; 8 mm), elliptical fruits. There was no clear association between fruit colour and fruit nutrient composition. It would appear that these small, succulent, carbohydrate-rich and lipid-poor fruits cater to a wide range of generalist frugivores. 
 The variety of fruit colours in Coprosma stemmed from qualitative and quantitative differences in carotenoid and anthocyanin composition. The genetic basis for the control of these pathways is currently unknown, but it is assumed that a few regulatory genes can control a substantial amount of phenotypic variation. Considering the evolutionary history of Coprosma, it would appear that a history of recent and rapid speciation, hybridisation and reticulate evolution may have increased the tempo of fruit colour evolution in the genus.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Coprosma</field><field name="subject">Rubiaceae</field><field name="subject">New Zealand ecology</field><field name="subject">plant phylogeny</field><field name="subject">fruit genetics</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20061206.160155</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Lateral hip pain : an anatomical and clinical study</field><field name="creator">Woodley, Stephanie Jane</field><field name="description">Lateral hip pain (LHP), characterised by non-specific symptoms in the region of the greater trochanter, is a condition frequently encountered by physiotherapists and other health professionals. However, the pathogenesis of LHP is not well understood. Although pathology of the gluteal tendons and their associated bursae have long been implicated in the cause of this problem, trochanteric bursitis has emerged as the primary clinical diagnosis. In order to determine a differential diagnosis, clinicians are reliant on information collated from the patient history and physical examination, yet the validity of many of the tests used to diagnose LHP has not been established. Abnormalities of the gluteal bursae may give rise to LHP and therefore to ensure precision of clinical assessment and treatment techniques, knowledge of bursal morphology is essential. However, a review of the literature revealed that there are no complete morphological accounts of all the bursae in this area. Therefore, the main purposes of this study were (a) to determine the morphology of the bursae associated with the greater trochanter and (b) to examine the physiotherapy and radiological diagnoses of LHP, and the validity of selected tests used in the diagnosis of LHP. 
 In the anatomical study, the bursae deep to each of the layered gluteal tendons were examined in 21 embalmed human hips (9 male, 12 female; mean age 79 years, SD 9.4 years) using macro-dissection and histological techniques. Morphological associations, size, positions and histological characteristics of the bursae were recorded. A total of 121 bursae were identified in ten different locations, with an average of six bursae per hip. Variation was evident, but it was typical that at least two bursae were found deep to gluteus maximus (GMax) and the fascia lata, and gluteus medius (GMed). In approximately two-thirds of specimens a single bursa was situated deep to the tendon of gluteus minimus (GMin). All of these bursae demonstrated a synovial lining, which was predominantly areolar in type. This study revealed that numerous bursae are intimately associated with the greater trochanter, and provides new morphological detail which is of significance when considering clinical and biomechanical models of LHP. 
 A clinical study was undertaken whereby 40 consecutive patients (37 female, 3 male; mean age 54.4 years, SD 9.5 years) with unilateral LHP were recruited prospectively. Each eligible participant underwent a standardised physiotherapy assessment followed by a magnetic resonance (MR) imaging study of the pelvis and both hips. The MR images were analysed in random order by three radiologists blinded to clinical findings and symptomatic side, and the intra-and inter-observer reliability for image analysis was examined using the kappa statistic. To determine the validity of selected clinical tests as evaluated against MR imaging, sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative likelihood ratios (LRs) were calculated, and the chi-squared test was used to determine association. As demonstrated by MR imaging, GMed tendon pathology, bursitis, osteoarthritis (OA) and gluteal muscle atrophy are all associated with the report of LHP. Interestingly, these various pathologies were identified in asymptomatic as well as symptomatic limbs. However, while bursitis was equally prevalent in symptomatic and asymptomatic hips, GMed tendon pathology and OA were observed more frequently on the symptomatic side. Furthermore, muscle atrophy which predominantly affected GMin, was specific to symptomatic hips. 
 Large variation was evident in the strength of agreement between radiologists and there was little agreement between physiotherapy and radiological diagnoses of pathology. Physiotherapists frequently diagnosed trochanteric bursitis as a cause of LHP and while palpation was identified as the most provocative test for reproducing patients complaint of LHP, it was not shown to be a valid technique. Instead, the outcomes pertaining to the validity of the clinical tests indicate that attention should be focused towards the assessment and treatment of gluteal tendon pathology. The two tests that appeared to be most useful for diagnosing gluteal tendon pathology were pain reproduction with passive hip abduction and resisted testing of GMed and GMin. While these findings demonstrate that various pathologies are associated with the report of LHP, they also highlight some problems associated with the use of MR imaging as a reference standard. Before further clinical validation studies of LHP are undertaken in larger populations, it is recommended that verification of MR imaging outcomes are performed against surgical and histological findings.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">hip joint</field><field name="subject">diseases</field><field name="subject">pathophysiology</field><field name="subject">pain diagnosis.</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20061206.162321</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A defence of non-introspective simulationism</field><field name="creator">Ogle, Peter</field><field name="description">This thesis is a defence of non-introspective simulationism.

The thesis is in three parts; the first states non-introspective simulationism, the second surveys some relevant empirical findings and shows how simulationism explains (or at least accomodates) these, and the third compares simulationism with rival theories. 
 The two main claims of non-introspecitve simulationism (as defended) are: simulation is central to the acquisition of interpretational beliefs. Introspection has no role whatever. 
 Further central claims are: beliefs about our own currently intended behaviours are acquired by practical reasoning. Other interpretational beliefs are, in various ways, the product of simulation. Simulation requires little if any machinery not already required for practical reasoning. Knowledge of our own psychological states is acquired after and as a result of knowledge of others&#65533;.

The location of New Zealand at the edge of the Southern Ocean provides a natural laboratory for studying ocean processes in a variety of oceanic conditions. 
 A time series of a surface transect across the Otago Continental Shelf was undertaken between April 2002 and January 2005 to measure the organic complexation of iron, hydrographic parameters and macronutrient concentrations. The study area contains three distinct water masses: 1) neritic water; 2) the Southland Current, derived from the Subtropical Surface Water (STW); 3) Subantarctic Surface Water (SASW). Hydrological measurements outlined the positions of the three water masses as being fixed within predictable boundaries. Variations in nutrient concentrations in the study area indicated that SASW is the predominant source of nitrate and phosphate to the shelf. Dissolved iron concentrations dropped sharply seaward from several nanomolar to sub-nanomolar levels. The dissolved iron was fully complexed with strong organic ligands in all three water masses, and the ligand concentrations also showed a slightly seaward decreasing trend. Trends in dissolved iron and the iron-binding ligand concentrations related to season were only obvious in neritic waters. Concentration maxima occurred during late spring and summer months, and concentration minima occurred in the middle of each year (winter months). Dissolved iron concentration was low (~0.1 nM) in SASW year round. Data from the present study are in support of that the SASW as a whole is classified as a high nitrate low chlorophyll (HNLC) water body and has an iron-limited phytoplankton population. 
 East of the New Zealand landmass, the Subtropical Convergence (STC) is topographically locked to the Chatham Rise. This is a dynamic region of enhanced primary production (Bradford-Grieve et al., 1997), which separates macronutrient-depleted STW from macronutrient-replete SASW. Dissolved iron concentrations were low (~0.1-0.2 nM) in SASW, while elevated dissolved iron concentrations were observed at the north flank of the Chatham Rise. The iron data imply that the regional currents may be an important vehicle for transporting the elevated iron across the front. Total dissolved iron-binding ligand concentrations were consistently higher (~0.5 nM) in the STW and STC waters than in SASW. The discrepancy in the ligand concentrations between STW and SASW may reflect a different contribution to the ligand pool from the local planktonic community. 
 The organic complexation of iron in the oligotrophic subtropical water columns in the Tasman Sea was also studied and comparison of waters to the north and south of the Tasman front were reported. The iron speciation data imply the potential biological origin for the iron-binding ligands, and the difference in ligand concentrations across the Tasman Front may represent slight differences in algal biomass. 
 A limited investigation to examine the production of natural organic iron-binding ligands by the Southern Ocean phytoplankton Phaeocystis antarctica was undertaken in laboratory culture experiments. Release of nanomolar levels of a strong iron-binding ligand was detected by cathodic stripping voltammetry (CSV) even under relatively high iron concentrations (&gt; 1nM). The estimated iron binding strength for the ligands was similar to those observed in the open ocean. Moreover, the kinetic data suggested the presence of another weaker ligand class, which had a higher Fe concentration (&gt;2 nM) and was not detectable by the CSV ligand titration technique. 
 Our field observations and culture experiment results suggest that the Fe-binding ligands are biologically produced. It appears algae engineer their environment to make Fe more available/accessible for longer by producing these ligands. Therefore, the organic speciation of Fe plays a very important role in the sustained nutrition of ocean primary productivity and must be accounted for in geochemical modelling.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">seawater</field><field name="subject">iron content</field><field name="subject">analysis</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070117.091325</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Hobbesian theory of primitive state formation</field><field name="creator">Williamson, Graham Scott</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the question of how primitive states form. The first part of the thesis defines a state. I then analyse Hobbes&#65533;s Theory of the Commonwealth by Acquisition (TCA), expounded in Leviathan. I conclude that this theory fails as an answer to the question of how primitive states form as it suffers from at least five major flaws. I go on to explain, modify and correct Hobbes&#65533;s TCA through techniques that have been used in modern critiques of Hobbes&#65533;s Theory of the Commonwealth by Institution. The result is the strongest possible answer that Hobbes can give to the question of how primitive states form. I conclude that his attempt fails as even if the technical aspects of his theory can be fixed, the overall problem of empirical falsification occurs. 
 I then put forward my own theory, based on the modified Hobbesian theory. The major innovation is the replacement of individuals with groups in the Hobbesian State of Nature. This move answers the problem of empirical falsification, at least initially. The theory also helps to explain several of the more technical problems with Hobbes&#65533;s theory. The resulting theory is a Hobbesian theory of primitive state formation. 
 The next step in the thesis is to match the Hobbesian theory of primitive state formation to the empirical evidence of primitive state formation, represented by anthropology. I analyse the anthropological literature and put forward that at least one recent research program in anthropology matches my Hobbesian theory of primitive state formation. 
 I conclude that Hobbesian theory, based on the TCA can be successfully modernised into a plausible answer to the question of how primitive states formed.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">primitive states</field><field name="subject">political anthropology</field><field name="subject">natural law</field><field name="subject">nature and civilization</field><field name="subject">Thomas Hobbes (1588-1679)</field><field name="subject">Leviathan</field><field name="subject">political science</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070117.155354</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The genetic and conservation consequences of species translocations in New Zealand saddlebacks and robins</field><field name="creator">Taylor, Sabrina S.</field><field name="description">Species translocations result in demographic bottlenecks that may produce inbreeding depression and reduce genetic variation through random sampling and drift, an outcome that could decrease long-term fitness and adaptive potential of many New Zealand species. Despite considerable evidence for costs associated with inbreeding and reduced genetic variation, some species have recovered from a small number of individuals and are thriving, perhaps via high growth rates, differential survival of heterozygous individuals or inbreeding avoidance. I examined the genetic consequences of species translocations in saddlebacks (Philesturnus carunculatus) with additional data provided for robins (Petroica australis) where possible. I first assessed whether contemporary genetic variation represented historical levels or a decline following demographic bottlenecks. I then examined whether sequential demographic bottlenecks caused sequential genetic bottlenecks and reviewed whether populations founded with a small number of birds were likely to go extinct. This analysis was followed by an investigation of two mechanisms that may maintain or reduce fitness costs, differential survival of heterozygous individuals and mate choice to avoid genetically similar individuals. 
 Evidence from museum specimens suggests that low levels of genetic variation in contemporary saddlebacks is no different to historical genetic variation in the only source population, Big South Cape Island. An ancient founding event to Big South Cape Island is probably the cause of severe genetic bottlenecking rather than the demographic bottleneck caused by rats in the 1960s. In robins, genetic variation decreased slightly between museum and contemporary samples suggesting that recent population declines and habitat fragmentation have caused reductions in current levels of genetic variation. 
 Serial demographic bottlenecks caused by sequential translocations of saddlebacks did not appear to decrease genetic variation. Loss of genetic variation due to random sampling was probably minimized because the low level of genetic variation remaining in the species was probably represented in the number of birds translocated to new islands. Models assessing future loss of genetic variation via drift showed that high growth rates combined with high carrying capacity on large islands would probably maintain existing genetic variation. In contrast, low carrying capacity on small islands would probably result in considerable loss of genetic variation over time. Saddleback populations on small islands may require occasional immigrants to maintain long-term genetic variation. 
 Saddleback and robin populations established with a small number of founders did not have an increased risk of failure, suggesting that inbreeding was not substantial enough to prevent populations from growing and recovering. However, modelling showed that translocated saddleback and robin populations grow exponentially even when egg failure rates (a measure of inbreeding depression) are extremely high. Although inbreeding depression may be considerable, populations may be judged healthy simply because they show strong growth rates. Discounting the problem of inbreeding depression may be premature especially under novel circumstances such as environmental change or disease. 
 Finally, two mechanisms proposed to avoid or delay the costs of inbreeding depression and loss of genetic variation do not appear to be important in saddlebacks or robins. Heterozygosity was not related to survivorship in saddlebacks that successfully founded new populations, and neither saddlebacks nor robins chose genetically dissimilar mates to avoid inbreeding. 
 In conclusion, most saddleback populations should not require genetic management, although populations on small islands will probably need occasional immigrants. In robins, large, unfragmented populations should be protected where possible.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">introduced birds</field><field name="subject">New Zealand robin</field><field name="subject">Creadion carunculatus</field><field name="subject">habitat</field><field name="subject">South Island (N.Z.)</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070118.101358</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Habitat selection in translocated bird populations : the case study of Stewart Island robin and South Island saddleback in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Michel, Pascale</field><field name="description">The choice of a place to live and reproduce is crucial for species&#65533; survival in providing them with adequate resources and shelter from predators or climatic conditions. Determining habitat suitability in endangered species is important for the success of translocation as a conservation tool. In addition, understanding mechanisms (source/sink system versus ecological traps) that drive habitat selection in translocated animals may be critical to population viability. In New Zealand, where ecosystems are highly vulnerable to extinction, habitat restoration on predator-free off-shore islands is an important recovery tool. Therefore, there is a need to understand the relationship between the establishment of the translocated populations and the characteristics of their new environment. 
 Previous research indicated that re-introduced populations of Stewart Island robin (Petroica australis rakiura - Toutouwai) and South Island saddleback (Philesternus carunculatus carunculatus - Tieke) on Ulva Island (Stewart Island), New Zealand, showed preferences for coastal habitats that were characterized by low-lying dense vegetation and open ground cover. In this study, we further investigated territorial establishment in these two populations since re-introduction and looked at how birds utilised the landscape. I hypothesised that sites colonised soon after re-introduction were of high quality and later on, birds moved into unsuitable habitats. I defined habitat quality at a micro-scale in terms of vegetation structure, nest characteristics and food availability. I modeled bird presence and nesting success in relation to habitat components to determine factors in the environment that influenced breeding site selection and contributed to successful nesting in these two species. I discussed results in comparison to similar bird-habitat models developed for the South Island saddleback population on Motuara Island (Marlborough Sounds) and examined explanatory variables in each model. 
 Translocated birds in the three studied populations first established territories in coastal scrub, and in the following years moved into larger coastal forest stands. Although vegetation structure was the primary variable explaining site selection in these populations, vegetation composition should still be considered important as it dictated the suitability of nesting substrate and the availability of food items. There was no evidence that first-colonised areas were more suitable habitats, and I concluded that these cases could not be used as examples of ecological traps. Instead, results suggested that with increased density robins and saddlebacks on Ulva have more recently settled in sites less suitable to nesting and foraging, thus underlying a source/sink structure. However, the sparse distribution of food items on Motuara contributed to a lack of territorial behavior and environmental effect on breeding success; therefore a source/sink system could not be confirmed in this population. I recommended that future translocation sites give preference to mixed-size stands with broadleaved species that are characterised by dense canopy below 4 m height and with suitable cavities in live trees. Lastly, due to robins&#65533; and saddlebacks&#65533; attraction to conspecifics and their territorial behavior, resources evenly distributed across the landscape could also increase their survival and reproductive success.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">introduced birds</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Ulva Island (N.Z.)</field><field name="subject">Stewart Island robin</field><field name="subject">South Island saddleback</field><field name="subject">Creadion carunculatus</field><field name="subject">habitat selection</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070118.143501</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modelling the population dynamics and viability analysis of franciscana (Pontoporia blainvillei) and Hector&#65533;s dolphins (Cephalorhynchus hectori) under the effects of bycatch in fisheries, parameter uncertainty and stochasticity</field><field name="creator">Secchi, Eduardo Resende</field><field name="description">Incidental mortality in fisheries, especially gillnets, is one of the most important causes of decline of many species of cetaceans around the globe. Local populations of franciscana, Pontoporia blainvillei, and Hector&#65533;s dolphins, Cephalorhynchus hectori, have been subject to high levels of mortality in gillnets for several decades. This is due to a combination of extensive overlap in distribution of these coastal dolphins and large numbers of fishing nets. 
 Stage-specific population dynamic models (without environmental stochasticity) suggest that both species have a low potential for population growth of approximately 0.2% (95% CI: -3.7% to 4.2%) to 3.4% (95% CI: 1.6% to 6.4%) for franciscana and 0.85% (95% CI: -1.0% to 2.6%) for Hector&#65533;s dolphins. Although the two species have similar population growth rates, they result from different life history strategies. Franciscana has a relatively low adult survival rate (0.86; SD = 0.016) which is compensated by a relatively high reproductive potential. The latter is a combination of early reproduction and high fecundity. Hector&#65533;s dolphin has a low reproductive potential, which is a combination of late reproduction and low fecundity, which is probably compensated by a relatively high adult survival rate (0.92; SD = 0.02) Apparent differences in growth rate among franciscana populations are possibly due to a combination of varying population-specific reproductive potential and, in some populations, inaccuracy in parameter estimates. Inaccuracy in estimating natural survival rates is also a cause for the low growth rate of Hector&#65533;s dolphins. 
 The estimated low population growth rates of these species are insufficient to compensate for current levels of fishing-related mortality in some local populations, especially when environmental and/or demographic stochasticity is considered. Under these circumstances Banks Peninsula population would have a negative mean population growth rate of 0.54% (95% CI: -2.2% to 0.9%) and would decrease below its initial size in approximately 74% of the simulations. Stochasticity alone would decrease considerably the probability of the Banks Peninsula population to grow and recover from past and current high bycatch levels. Effects of stochasticity were also high for one of the franciscana stocks (i.e. stock from Franciscana Management Area II). In other areas (e.g. West Coast of the South Island; franciscana stock from FMA I) fishing effort and bycatch mortality rate seem not to be impeding population growth. Even in a stochastic environment and under current levels of fishing effort, the West Coast population and the franciscana stock from FMA I would grow at a positive rate of 0.32% (95% CI: -1.2% to 1.8%) and 3.1% (95% CI: 2.2 to 7.2%), respectively. Parameter uncertainty does not change the conclusion that immediate and extreme limitations on fishing practice and effort are necessary to increase the chances of recovery for some local populations/stocks. 
 Fishing effort in New Zealand is regulated by a quota system. The quota system, the low number of fishing boats and the relatively low overlap between fishing nets and dolphins are probably the reasons for the positive population growth of Hector&#65533;s dolphins from the West Coast of the South Island. On the other hand, not even the Marine Mammal Sanctuary is sufficient to avoid negative mean population growth rate of Hector&#65533;s dolphins under current levels of fishing effort off Banks Peninsula. In Brazil, Uruguay and Argentina, where franciscana occurs, gillnet fisheries are not regulated. In some areas, faced with a declining fish stocks, fishermen have increased fishing effort to compensate for reduced catches, and the bycatch of franciscana has increased as a consequence. Strategies aiming at the conservation of these two species are likely to benefit other components of the ecosystem. Especially in the case of franciscana, reducing fishing effort is likely to promote the recovery of depleted fish stocks.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">La Plata dolphin</field><field name="subject">Hector's dolphin</field><field name="subject">bycatches (fisheries)</field><field name="subject">population ecology</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070118.162020</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Academics&#65533; experiences of Performance-Based Research Funding (PBRF) : governmentality and subjection</field><field name="creator">Ashcroft, Craig</field><field name="description">In 2002 New Zealand&#65533;s government set out to "accelerate" the nation&#65533;s "transformation into a knowledge society" (Ministry of Education, 2002a, p. 16). Underpinning the development of this so-called 'knowledge society' was a new approach in the way tertiary education was funded. This included introducing a new contestable model of research funding called Performance-Based Research Funding (PBRF). The research reported here was conducted at a critical juncture in the ongoing development and implementation of PBRF because it captures the experiences of fifteen academics as they encounter PBRF and the Quality Evaluation exercise for the first time. Their experiences of the inaugural 2003 Quality Evaluation exercise were examined using a discourse analysis approach informed by Michel Foucault&#65533;s (1926-1984) ideas of 'subjection' and 'governmentality'. 'Subjection' occurs when individuals shape their identities by responding to the multiple discourses that are available to them at any particular time and within any historical context (Foucault, 1969). 'Governmentality' refers to a particular instrument, technique or activity that guides and shapes conduct by producing a compliant human subject capable of supporting the interests and objectives of the state (Foucault, 1994a). In the case of academics this might mean conforming to PBRF policies and practices and participating in the development and transformation of a new 'knowledge society'. 
 In this thesis I examine the potential for PBRF to reshape and redirect the nature of research and suggest that some assessment elements of the 2003 Quality Evaluation were flawed and, as a result, a number of participants in this study were now making decisions about their research that appeared contrary to their best interests. I also investigate PBRF as a field of compliance and argue that the Quality Evaluation exercise represents a technology of government that targets the activities and practices of New Zealand&#65533;s research academics with the effect of manifesting a more docile and compliant academic subject. I then question PBRF&#65533;s impact on the career aspirations and opportunities of academics and claim that the PBRF Quality Evaluation framework has already shifted from being a mechanism for distributing funds for research to one that identifies and rewards the most 'talented' researchers via institutional appointments and promotions. Finally, I interrogate the pursuit and practice of academic freedom and argue that as a consequence of PBRF, a number of participants in this study have positioned themselves in ways that could diminish and constrain their traditional rights to academic freedom. 
 PBRF has the potential to locate academics within a new status-driven hierarchy of professional validation whereby the Quality Evaluation exercise will purportedly measure, evaluate and reward the most 'talented' researchers and the 'best' research. In this thesis I argue that the PBRF Quality Evaluation framework operates as a form of disciplinary power exercised as part of an international trend of intensifying audit and assessment practices in higher education. In this sense, I claim that PBRF exists as an instrument of governmentality capable of constituting a new type of academic subject by significantly shifting the way academics will have to think and conduct their professional selves in relation to their work and research.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">New Zealand Ministry of Education</field><field name="subject">Tertiary education strategy 2002/07</field><field name="subject">discourse analysis</field><field name="subject">Michel Foucault (1926-1984)</field><field name="subject">philosophy</field><field name="subject">education</field><field name="subject">college teachers</field><field name="subject">Government aid to higher education</field><field name="subject">higher education and state</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070125.162438</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Experiments with Bose-Einstein condensates in optical lattices and cold collisions of ultracold atoms</field><field name="creator">Mellish, Angela Susan</field><field name="description">The experimental realisation of Bose-Einstein condensation in 1995 opened up a wealth of opportunities for probing quantum states of matter. The development of many tools used to manipulate such ultracold samples and the rapid progress on understanding these systems will ultimately lead to great technological advances. The work described in this thesis contributes to this worldwide effort and here we present experiments which investigate the properties and behaviour of ultracold atoms. 
 In the first experiments presented here, we have studied features of Bose-Einstein condensates loaded into an optical lattice formed by the interference of two laser beams. By altering the phase of the lattice at the Bragg condition, we investigate the effect of the phase shift on the dressed-atom states. We find that by applying a +(-)[pi]/2 phase shift after a [pi]/2 (3[pi]/2) lattice pulse, we are able to quickly and precisely load the ground and first excited eigenstates of the lattice. In another experiment, we use a periodically pulsed stationary optical lattice and a tightly-confined Bose-Einstein condensate to investigate the nonlinear kicked harmonic oscillator at quantum anti-resonance. We observe periodic behaviour in the energy of the condensate, however we show that the nonlinearity is not strong enough to enter the predicted chaotic regime. In addition, the amplitude of the energy oscillations damps to an average value and we relate this to dephasing of the coupling across the finite momentum width of the condensate. 
 In the second series of experiments, we use a double-well magnetic collider to investigate cold collisions between ultracold atoms. By creating two ultracold clouds in a double-well magnetic trap and then transforming the trap to a single well, we accelerate the clouds together to initiate a collision between them. We describe in detail the analysis method that we use to extract the partial-wave phase shifts from the matter-wave interference patterns associated with the scattered atoms. We then implement a two-photon pulse, which is applied prior to the collision to convert one of the clouds to a different spin state. This enables the study of scattering between distinguishable states which exhibited anti-symmetric p-wave scattering via the interference with the s- and d-waves previously observed for indistinguishable states. We find the position of the d-wave shape resonance and compare our data to a coupled-channels model.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bose-Einstein condensation</field><field name="subject">photonics</field><field name="subject">laser cooling</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070126.100723</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modified liposomes as adjuvants</field><field name="creator">White, Karen Louise</field><field name="description">Despite the progress in elucidating antigens for both therapeutic and prophylactic vaccines, safety concerns over current vaccine delivery vehicles and adjuvants has limited the development of new vaccines. In particular, there is an urgent need for effective vaccines capable of stimulating cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses against intracellular pathogens or tumor cells. Liposomes are under investigation as a particulate vaccine delivery system with the required safety profile and demonstrated ability to target antigens to dendritic cells (DC), the cells of the immune system responsible for initiating effective and long lasting CTL immune responses. Unmodified liposomes however, are inherently non-immunogenic and thus not capable of stimulating activation of DC, which is a necessary step in immune activation. In this thesis the use of modified liposomes to more efficiently target vaccine antigens to DC and then activate the DC sufficiently to initiate down-stream immune responses was investigated. 
 In the first approach to liposome modification, mannosylated phospholipids were incorporated within the liposome bilayer to target C-type lectins on DC. Incorporation of mono- or tri-mannosylated phospholipids within liposomes was found to be an effective means of attaching mannose-containing ligands to the liposome surface without compromising the integrity of the liposome structure. The uptake of tri-mannose-containing liposomes was enhanced in human monocyte derived DC (MoDC) compared to both unmodified liposomes and mono-mannose-containing liposomes. In contrast, neither mono- nor tri-mannose-containing liposomes were taken up by murine bone marrow derived DC (BMDC) to a greater extent than unmodified liposomes. This finding may reflect the differences in ligand specificity for C-type lectins on DC derived from different mammalian species. It was also found in these studies that increased uptake of liposomal antigens by DC does not necessarily result in increased DC activation, as evidenced by a lack of up-regulation of DC surface activation markers and ability to stimulate T cell proliferation. 
 The second approach to liposome modification involved the incorporation of lipid core peptides (LCPs) into the liposome structure. LCPs alone were demonstrated to be able to stimulate DC and subsequent CD8+ T cell activation in vitro. LCP-based vaccines were also able to stimulate effective cytotoxic immune responses in vivo, and protect against tumor challenge, but only if administered in alum with CD4 help. Liposomes containing LCPs were able to stimulate greater DC activation and subsequent CD8+ T cell proliferation in vitro compared with unmodified liposomes. In the in vivo studies however, LCP-containing liposomes were not able to stimulate a cytotoxic immune response or protect against tumor challenge as effectively as LCP administered in alum. 
 In the final approach to liposome modification, inclusion of the adjuvant Quil A was investigated for its ability to increase the immunogenicity of LCP-containing liposomes. It was found that small amounts of Quil A could be incorporated into liposomes without compromising the liposome bilayer. The inclusion of as little as 2% Quil A was able to stimulate DC activation and subsequent T cell proliferation in in vitro studies. In addition, immunisation of mice with LCP-containing liposomes with incorporated Quil A was found to stimulate an in vivo CTL immune response comparable to LCPs administered under optimal vaccine conditions. 
 In conclusion, the work presented in this thesis demonstrates that modified liposomes are a useful vaccine delivery system for the initiation of in vivo cytotoxic and prophylactic immune responses.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">immunological adjuvants</field><field name="subject">vaccines</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070126.131417</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fine mapping and characterisation of an autoimmune diabetes locus, insulin dependent diabetes 21, (Idd21) on mouse chromosome-18</field><field name="creator">Hollis-Moffatt, Jade Elissa</field><field name="description">Autoimmune disease is comprised of a wide variety of disorders characterised by a loss of self-tolerance towards a target organ or systemic region leading to its eventual destruction. Type 1 diabetes (T1D), autoimmune thyroid disease (AITD) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are debilitating organ-specific disorders. These disorders arise from a combination of genetic factors and environmental triggers. A greater level of basic understanding of these disorders is required to delay and/or prevent their effects. Numerous autoimmune susceptibility loci have been implicated in the development of these disorders, but only a few causative genes have been identified. The aim of this project was to use comparative mapping between the human and mouse genomes to provide a greater understanding of the human autoimmune susceptibility locus, IDDM6, shown to be involved in a number of autoimmune disease conditions. 
 Hall et al., (2003) previously demonstrated that the mouse autoimmune diabetes locus, Idd21, on distal mouse chr18 contains orthology to human IDDM6, IDDM10, IDDM18 and rat Iddm3. As part of this project the Idd21 locus was fine mapped using the congenic mapping technique. Beginning with the consomic mouse strain, NOD.ABHChr18 (90Mb of Biozzi/ABH-derived diabetes-resistant chr18 introgressed onto a non-obese diabetic (NOD) genetic background), 13 NOD.ABHIdd21 congenic mouse strains were established. The diabetes incidences of these congenic mouse strains were statistically compared stepwise along mouse chr18 and Idd21 was fine mapped to at least four independent autoimmune diabetes loci. Idd21.1 and Idd21.2 were located on distal mouse chr18 in regions orthologous to human IDDM6 and rat Iddm3 and Idd21.3a/b and Idd21.4 were located on proximal mouse chr18 in regions orthologous to human IDDM18 and IDDM10 respectively. Candidate genes of notable interest include Map3k8, Spink5, Cd14, Dcc, Smad4 and 7, Miz1, Nfatc1 and Cd226. 
 Idd21.1 was further fine mapped. Beginning with the NOD.ABHD18Mit8-D18Mit214[(75-85.1Mb)] (Idd21.1) congenic strain (containing at least 10.1Mb of distal chr18 Biozzi/ABH diabetes-resistant DNA introgressed onto a NOD genetic background), seven subcongenic mouse strains were created. The diabetes incidence of these subcongenic mouse strains were statistically compared stepwise along mouse chr18 and Idd21.1 was fine mapped to at least three independent autoimmune diabetes loci; Idd21.11 (72.6-76.1Mb), Idd21.12a/b (75-76.1Mb and 80.6-81.4Mb) and Idd21.13 (84.8-85.1Mb). Candidate genes of interest in these regions include Dcc, Smad4 and 7, Miz1, Nfatc1, and Cd226. 
 Functional characterisation of the Idd21.1 locus was performed by adoptively transferring splenocytes from female NOD or NOD.ABHIdd21.1 mice into cohorts of severe combined immune deficient (scid) female mice, NOD/LtSz.Prkdc[scid] and NOD/LtSz.Prkdc[scid].ABHIdd21.1. There were two notable findings from this work. Firstly, NOD.ABHIdd21.1 splenocytes are not as effective as NOD at transferring diabetes to either NOD/LtSz.Prkdc[scid] (P = 0.0004) or NOD/LtSz.Prkdc[scid].ABHIdd21.1 (P = 0.0178), suggesting that Idd21.1 acquired immune cells are not as diabetogenic as NOD. Secondly, NOD/LtSz.Prkdc[scid].ABHIdd21.1 mice are more resistant to autoimmune attack than NOD/LtSz.Prkdc[scid] when injected with either NOD (P = 0.0015) or NOD.ABHIdd21.1 splenocytes (P = 0.0014), suggesting that Idd21.1 either acts by altering the intrinsic resistance of beta-cells to autoimmune attack or due to changes in the innate immune system. 
 Other NOD-based models of autoimmune disease, spontaneous and experimental autoimmune thyroiditis and spontaneous colitis, were also investigated to determine whether Idd21.1 is a common autoimmune disease locus. When bred onto the NOD.Cg-H2[h4] (thyroiditis model) genetic background Idd21.1 was demonstrated to increase the development of thyroiditis and reduce the incidence of insulitis in spontaneous (untreated) but not experimental (NaI-induced) NOD.Cg-H2[h4] mice. When bred onto the NOD.Cg-Il10[tm1Cgn] (colitis) genetic background Idd21.1 was demonstrated to inhibit the development of rectal prolapse in breeding female NOD.Cg-Il10[tm1Cgn] mice. 
 Data from this thesis demonstrate that the IDDM6 orthologous region in mouse, Idd21.1, contains several loci that influence autoimmune diabetes, thyroiditis and colitis in NOD-based mouse models. These findings are consistent with previous knowledge that IDDM6 is a common autoimmune susceptibility locus.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">autoimmune diseases</field><field name="subject">diabetes</field><field name="subject">genetic aspects</field><field name="subject">molecular aspects</field><field name="subject">gene mapping</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070130.151657</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Biodiversity along a gradient of modification : plant invertebrates and reptile diversity in mid-altitude tall tussock (Chionochloa rigida) grasslands, eastern Central Otago, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Dixon, Katherine Marguerite</field><field name="description">This thesis set out to examine the soils, plants, lichens, invertebrates and common skinks along a gradient of habitat modification. This gradient was represented by ten study sites, of varying management histories, in a mid altitude tall tussock (Chionochloa spp.) grassland in eastern Central Otago. One extreme of the gradient was represented by intact tall tussock plants with a high density of inter tussock vegetation. The other extreme was represented by intensively managed exotic pasture. 
 Native plants, invertebrates and reptiles were present along the entire gradient of modification and there was a clear threshold in the diversity of native plants along the gradient. This threshold was reached after the management practice of ploughing was applied to a site. Sites that had not been ploughed were found to be similar in their native plant diversity, and all unploughed sites had significantly higher native plant diversity than unploughed sites. 
 There was considerable variation in the abundance of individual plant and Coleoptera species along the modification gradient. The most intensively modified sites had the lowest plant diversity, the lowest abundance and diversity of Orthoptera, as well as the lowest abundance of common skinks. Sites with low levels of modification contained a higher abundance of common skinks, and, native forbs, lichens and bryophytes than the more intensively modified sites. 
 With regard to individual plant and Coleoptera species recorded, there were generally not clear thresholds for their presence and absence along the modification gradient. Rather, there was a gradual turnover for most species along the gradient such that the plant and Coleoptera community at opposing ends of the gradient had less species in common sites of similar modification levels. 
 A high proportion of the Coleoptera species observed were present in all sites, suggesting that disturbance has selected for an adaptive generalist life trait, and that the species remaining comprise the resilient portion of the Coleoptera fauna. The relationship between Coleoptera communities and the gradient of modification was scale dependent, with the strongest relationship being observed at the largest scale measured. 
 The hypothesis that faunal diversity and abundance would be best predicted by the structural diversity of the vegetation rather than by plant species diversity was tested. Structural diversity was strongly correlated (p &lt; 0.01) with Coleoptera diversity, and Coleoptera abundance whereas plant species diversity was not. However, plant species diversity was a stronger correlate of common skink abundance than plant structural diversity. The structural diversity of the vegetation has the potential to be measured remotely and could be a correlate for faunal diversity and abundance when undertaking landscape scale studies. 
 This thesis demonstrates that native biota exists within the agricultural environment of the mid-altitude tall tussock (Chionochloa rigida) grasslands of eastern Central Otago despite intensive modification in some areas. The findings suggest that it is possible to integrate the objectives of agriculture and the conservation of some faunal groups especially for the more resilient species. However, this study also indicates that relatively unmodified sites are valuable reservoirs of biodiversity in the mid altitude zone and it is recommended that the limited number of lightly modified sites that remain in the mid altitude zone be conserved.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chionochloa rigida</field><field name="subject">grassland ecology</field><field name="subject">tussockgrass</field><field name="subject">skinks</field><field name="subject">beetles</field><field name="subject">orthoptera</field><field name="subject">herbs</field><field name="subject">lichens</field><field name="subject">bryophytes</field><field name="subject">habitat modification</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Central Otago District</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070130.154858</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The development of medical students&#65533; communication skills throughout training : a longitudinal study</field><field name="creator">Brown, Nicola</field><field name="description">There is ample evidence that clinical communication skills deteriorate in medical students without specific training, but are improved by training. However, little is known about how well-equipped students are to communicate with patients on entering medical school, and there is limited evidence about whether all students improve with tuition in communication skills. This thesis describes a longitudinal study into these issues at the University of Otago&#65533;s Medical School. It was hypothesised that the majority of participants would demonstrate significant improvement in communication skills over their first two phases of specific tuition in communication. However, a small minority of participants were expected to fail to develop adequate skills in communication over this time, and the researcher wished to investigate whether any of the variables measured at baseline (demographic characteristics, personal qualities, academic abilities, and demonstrated interaction and interview observation skills) would predict those participants who developed superior communication skills, or who failed to demonstrate sufficient improvement by the end of eighteen months of medical education. 
 Participants were 232 new entrants to the Otago Medical School programme, who were evaluated at three time points over the first eighteen months of their medical training. After completing a range of baseline measures (including a pre-training videotaped interview with a simulated patient role-played by an actor), participants completed two phases of communication skills training and, at the end of each phase, undertook a further videotaped interview. Interviews were marked by trained raters, using a novel assessment tool, the Brown-Peace Interview Marking Schedule, developed specifically for this purpose. Actors and participants themselves also evaluated each interview. 
 Results showed that there was considerable variation in participants&#65533; abilities to perform the pre-training interview, indicating that the communication skills required in a clinical setting were not present in the majority of participants before training. Analysis of participant performance over time indicated that, while certain skills improved with training (e.g., receptive listening skills, non-verbal expression, and degree of structure in the interview) others did not improve significantly (e.g., responsiveness to the patient&#65533;s needs). As a group, participants benefited from the training, but a small sub-group of participants exhibited significant deficits in communication, even after two phases of communication skills training. It was easier to predict those participants who would develop superior communication skills than those who would continue to experience difficulties with simulated interviews. However, a small number of qualities (such as lack of familiarity with the English language, and high levels of personal qualities such as aloofness) were useful predictors of poor performance in the videotaped interviews. 
 Further research could clarify whether the same personal qualities influence student performance in later interviews, once students have had more experiential training and opportunities to practise interviewing in a range of settings. In terms of the practical implications of the research findings, a number of issues are highlighted, such as the range of skills required of those who teach and evaluate communication skills. Recommendations are made regarding the timing, content and implementation of communication skills training for medical students.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">medical students</field><field name="subject">medical education</field><field name="subject">communication in medicine</field><field name="subject">study and teaching</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070130.160535</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Shared factors in autobiographical memory and theory of mind development</field><field name="creator">Pinder, Kirsty</field><field name="description">When humans use the mental states (e.g., beliefs, intentions) and the emotional states of others to predict or explain another person&#65533;s behaviour, they have demonstrated their theory of mind understanding. Theory of mind is "one of the quintessential abilities that makes us human" (Baron-Cohen, 2000, p. 3). Emotion understanding has been considered by some to be an aspect of theory of mind understanding. There are several theories proposed to explain the development of theory of mind, from changes in representational abilities (Perner, 1991), to having an innate domain specific module (Fodor, 1992; Leslie, 1994), to social linguistic influences (Nelson et al., 2003). One facet of theory of mind understanding, understanding false belief, has been consistently found to develop at around 3 or 4 years of age (e.g., Wimmer &amp; Perner, 1983). Another cognitive ability that develops at the approximately the same time is that of autobiographical memory. Autobiographical memory has been defined as "memory for information and events pertaining to the self" (Howe &amp; Courage, 1993, p. 306). There are also several theories explaining the onset of autobiographical memory. Two similar theories by Perner (1991) and Welch-Ross (1995) proposed that until a child possesses dual representational abilities (or theory of mind), they cannot form autobiographical memories. Nelson (1993) and Fivush (2001) have both proposed that autobiographical memory is developed through shared narratives with more experienced others (e.g., parents). There are several factors that have been found to contribute to theory of mind, emotion understanding, and autobiographical memory. Language abilities have been related to all three cognitive abilities (e.g., Slade &amp; Ruffman, 2005; Dunn &amp; Cutting, 1999; Harley &amp; Reese, 1999). Factors such as maternal talk, gender of the child, and the number of siblings the child has, have all been related to at least two of these abilities. In the current study, I addressed the relation between theory of mind understanding, emotion understanding, and autobiographical memory in three studies. The first study investigated the relations between language, theory of mind, emotion understanding, and mother-child talk about past events in 61 children at three 6- month intervals from 42- to 54- months of age. The second study also investigated these factors and the children&#65533;s pretense in 59 children at 48- months of age. In the second study, the mother&#65533;s theory of mind and emotion understanding were also measured. In the third study, I investigated the relations between theory of mind, emotion understanding and early memory recall in 73 adults, with an average age of 20 years. One key finding was that, despite theoretical predictions, there was no clear relation between theory of mind understanding and autobiographical memory in either children or adults. Results showed that theory of mind and emotion understanding are related but distinct abilities. The number of siblings, or the gender of the participants were not strongly related to theory of mind, autobiographical memory, or emotion understanding. Language abilities and maternal talk were the strongest factors related to the development of theory of mind, autobiographical memory and emotion understanding.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">autobiographical memory</field><field name="subject">philosophy of mind</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070131.145223</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Experiments with Bose-Einstein condensates in optical potentials</field><field name="creator">Geursen, Reece Wim</field><field name="description">We present a detailed experimental investigation into Bose-Einstein condensates loaded into a one-dimensional optical standing wave at the Bragg condition. 
 The main emphasis of this thesis is the experimental and theoretical investigation into Bragg spectroscopy performed on circularly accelerating Bose-Einstein condensates. The condensate undergoes circular micromotion in a magnetic time-averaged orbiting potential trap and the effect of this motion on the Bragg spectrum is analysed. A simple frequency modulation model is used to interpret the observed complex structure, and broadening effects are considered using numerical solutions to the Gross-Pitaevskii equation.

The research addressed three main questions. First, at what age does the boundary of childhood amnesia occur in adults, and what is the shape of the boundary? Second, is it possible for children to verbally express preverbal aspects of their memories after a 6-year delay? Third, is maternal narrative style during early childhood related to the age of adolescents&#65533; earliest autobiographical memories? 
 In Experiment 1A, I examined whether the way in which we ask adults to sample their memories alters estimates of the offset of childhood amnesia. Independent groups of adults were asked to describe and date one memory from any time in their lives associated with each of six cue words (Lifespan Condition), one childhood memory associated with each of six cue words (Childhood Condition), or their earliest memory associated with each of six cue words (Cued Earliest Condition). A fourth group of adults was asked to describe and date their six earliest memories (Uncued Earliest Condition). As predicted, participants in the Cued Earliest and Uncued Earliest Conditions reported earlier memories than participants in the Childhood Condition, who in turn reported earlier memories than participants in the Lifespan Condition. Consistent with prior research, when adults were asked to report their earliest memories, with or without the use of cue words, the mean age of the earliest memory reported was between 3 and 4 years. 
 In Experiment 1B, I examined the distribution of the early memories reported by six individual adults by asking them to report all the memories that they could recall from each year of childhood, until they had reported at least their 20 earliest memories. When the number of memories recalled was plotted as a function of age at event, the distributions looked like step functions, with the step occurring at ages 4-6 years. Participants also reported some early memories for events that occurred before this age. 
 In Experiment 2, I examined children&#65533;s and parents&#65533; verbal and non-verbal recall for a specific event - the Magic Shrinking Machine - after a 6-year delay. The children were aged 27-51 months when they originally played with the machine. After a 6-year delay, nine of 46 children and 26 of 42 parents verbally recalled the event. There were no age-related differences in the amount or accuracy of the information that participants reported about the event. When children&#65533;s reports were compared to their task-relevant vocabulary measured at the time of the event, there were just two instances in which a child used a word to describe the event that had not been part of his or her productive vocabulary at the time of the event. Children showed no non-verbal recall of the event, relative to a group of age-matched controls. 
 In Experiment 3, I tested the hypothesis that the way that parents talk about the past with their children during early childhood will influence the age of these children&#65533;s earliest autobiographical memories when they are older. Conversations about past events between 17 mother-child dyads were recorded on multiple occasions between the children&#65533;s 2nd and 4th birthdays. When these children were between the ages of 12-13 years, they were asked to describe their earliest autobiographical memory. Adolescents whose mothers used a greater ratio of elaborations to repetitions when discussing the past with their child during early childhood had earlier first memories than did adolescents whose mothers used a smaller ratio of elaborations to repetitions. 
 The present findings on adults&#65533; earliest memories are consistent with a two-stage model of childhood amnesia. Theories that draw on multiple cognitive developments provide a more complete account of childhood amnesia than theories that focus on a single developmental milestone. I propose that neurological maturation and language acquisition set the stage for subsequent language-related developments that contribute to the emergence of autobiographical memory and, ultimately, the offset of childhood amnesia.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">amnesia</field><field name="subject">memory in children</field><field name="subject">cognition in children</field><field name="subject">parent and child</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070201.112748</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Westminster confession of faith and the cessation of special revelation</field><field name="creator">Milne, Garnet Howard</field><field name="description">The Westminster Confession of Faith (WCF), drawn up in London in the 1640s, has been one of the most influential confessions in the history of Reformed theology. It has occupied a very significant place in the life of a great many Protestant churches since the seventeenth century, and continues to serve as a chief subordinate standard in several major denominations today. 
 In the opening chapter of the Confession, the divines of Westminster included a clause which implied that there would no longer be any supernatural revelation from God for showing humankind the way of salvation. Means by which God had once communicated the divine will concerning salvation, such as dreams, visions, and the miraculous gifts of the Spirit, were said to be no longer applicable. However, many of the authors of the WCF accepted that "prophecy" continued in their time, and a number of them apparently believed that disclosure of God&#65533;s will through dreams, visions, and angelic communication remained possible. How is the "cessationist" clause of WCF 1:1 to be read in the light of these facts? Was it intended as a strict denial of the possibility that any supernatural revelation for the purposes of salvation could take place after the apostolic period, or did its authors, as some modern scholars have argued, allow for a more flexible view, in which such divine revelation through extraordinary means might still take place? This thesis explores these questions in the light of the modern debates over the interpretation of the Confession&#65533;s language and its implications for the church today. It considers the difference between "mediate" and "immediate" revelation as understood by the Westminster divines, and attempts to show that only "immediate" revelation was considered to have ceased, while "mediate" revelation, which always involved Scripture, was held to continue. 
 A detailed analysis of the writings of the Westminster divines reveals that these churchmen possessed both a strong desire to maintain the unity of Word and Spirit and a concern to safeguard the freedom of the Holy Spirit to speak to particular circumstances through the language and principles of Scripture. God still enabled predictive prophecy and spoke to individuals in extraordinary ways, but contemporary prophecy was held to be something distinct from the prophecy of New Testament figures. In the minds of both the Scottish Presbyterians and English Puritans, prophecy was considered to be an application of Scripture for a specific situation, not an announcement of new information not contained within the Bible. The Scriptures always remained essential for the process of discerning God&#65533;s will. 
 The Introduction to the thesis considers the debate over WCF 1:1 in its modern setting. Chapter One outlines the socio-political and theological context of the Westminster Assembly, and discusses the question of how to assess the respective contributions of the divines to the documents it produced. Chapter Two investigates the Westminster view of the necessity and scope of special revelation, and discusses the nature of the "salvation" which was conveyed by this means. Chapter Three surveys the exegetical traditions underpinning the teaching that former modalities of supernatural revelation had ceased. Chapter Four seeks to respond to modern claims that Puritan theology allowed for a "continuationist" position, by canvassing evidence both from seventeenth-century Reformed thinkers themselves and from their critics, who maintained that Westminster orthodoxy was indeed cessationist in style. Chapters Five and Six explore the claims to and explanations for "prophecy" in Reformed theology in both England and Scotland in the seventeenth century. Chapter Seven examines the question of the theological status of the Westminster Confession in its own time. To what extent were subscription requirements envisaged by the Assembly and the governments of the day, and what form did these requirements take? 
 The thesis concludes that the Westminster divines intended the cessationist clause to affirm that there was to be no more extra-biblical, "immediate" revelation for any purpose now that the church possessed the completed Scriptures. The written Word of God was fully capable of showing the way of "salvation" in its wider scope as either temporal or eternal deliverance. At the same time the divines did not intend to deny that God could still speak through special providences that might involve dreams or the ministry of angels, for example, but such revelation was always to be considered "mediate". The primary means was held to be the written Scriptures, illuminated by the Holy Spirit. The unity of the Word and Spirit was maintained, and God&#65533;s freedom to address individual circumstances remained intact.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Westminster Assembly (1643-1652)</field><field name="subject">Westminster Confession of Faith</field><field name="subject">Revelation</field><field name="subject">History of doctrines</field><field name="subject">Presbyterian Church</field><field name="subject">creeds</field><field name="subject">doctrines</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070201.162915</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The influence of ocean waves on the distribution of sea ice in an MIZ</field><field name="creator">Downer, Joshua</field><field name="description">A marginal ice zone (MIZ) is characterised by distinct ice floes and its direct exposure to the open ocean. Sea ice is typically described as a continuous material but this description can be inappropriate in an MIZ due to the granular nature of the ice cover and the scale of processes acting on the ice floes. In this thesis, the kinematic behaviour of sea ice in an MIZ modelled as a granular material is investigated with an emphasis on the influence of ocean waves. 
 The kinematic behaviour of a set of ice floes subject to ocean wave forcing was recorded in an experiment conducted in the Ross Sea. Kinematic data were recorded from each ice floe using a GPS receiver, tri-axial accelerometer, and compass. The data show (1) the influence of wave forcing and (2) collisions between neighbouring ice floes. It was also discovered that the GPS receivers were able to resolve the effects of ocean wave forcing despite their poor absolute accuracy. 
 The number density and normalised structure factor (NSF) are introduced to describe the spatial structure of a set of ice floes. Four idealised distributions (in 1D and 2D) are analysed to gain insight into the way that different factors determine the shape of the NSF. It is shown that (1) a significant sinusoidal deviation causes a peak in the NSF, (2) ordered structure dominates low spatial frequencies, and (3) disorder dominates high spatial frequencies. A comparison of the contributions from these different factors is used to estimate the significance of a sinusoidal deviation in the positions of the ice floes. 
 A granular model of an MIZ is developed using a novel set of equations of motion to examine the effect of ocean wave forcing. The equations of motion are derived for small ice floes and allows forcing by multiple waves. These equations predict a transient, wave-induced torque, which can be sustained by the application of a second force to the ice floe. Torque induced by the interaction of two forces on an ice floe may be a general feature of sea ice motion. 
 The number density and NSF are used to analyse the distribution of ice floes in the granular model. At low solids-fractions the number density is correlated at the frequency of the wave forcing. As the solids-fraction is increased this correlation is destroyed by collisions between the ice floes and new correlations are created that are related to the packing structure of the ice floes. When the number density is weighted by the velocity of the ice floes, the correlations between floes are related to the convolution of the wave velocity field and the number density. These correlations may be incorporated into the thickness distribution of large-scale models using the maximum entropy method. 
 The granular model was also examined as a percolating network of contacts and it was found that percolation was more likely to occur along the crest of a wave than in the direction of propagation.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">sea ice</field><field name="subject">ocean waves</field><field name="subject">mathematical models</field><field name="subject">Antarctica</field><field name="subject">Ross Sea Region</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070202.120522</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Assessing the effect of EIA : the influence of environmental effects information on resource consent decision-making in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Schijf, Bobbi</field><field name="description">Environmental impact assessment (EIA) was introduced to inform decision-makers of the potential environmental effects of the decision before them. It has been adopted worldwide and functions as one of the primary instruments for taking account of environmental consequences in project approval decision-making. To date, there has been very little systematic investigation that explores whether the decision-makers for whom the EIA information is produced actually use it, although there are indications that EIA information is not always effective in influencing decisions. This thesis examines how, and indeed if, environmental effects information influences the decision-making processes for which it is produced, and which factors determine the use of this information. Three main areas of concern are identified and investigated: the responses of individual decision-makers to environmental effects information; the characteristics of the effects information that influence these responses; and the processes by which the effects information is dealt with. 
 At the core of the methodology employed for this research is the development of an exploratory model of EIA-based decision-making. This model builds on the insights into decision processes from a variety of disciplines, including psychology and planning. To test the utility of the model, it is evaluated against the New Zealand system of resource consent approval decision-making under the Resource Management Act, by means of case studies. Through interviews, direct observation, and analysis of written documents the decision processes in these cases are analysed. These techniques have been augmented by psychosocial methods that allow further probing into the decision processes that takes place in a decision-maker&#65533;s head. 
 The research results show that the effort that is spent on the preparation of EIA reports and the improvement of EIA processes is not wasted. The EIA information clearly influences the decision processes for which it is intended but it is not influencing decisions optimally. EIA information often competes with information on environmental effects from other sources that is of higher quality, more credible, or better tailored to the decision-makers&#65533; information needs. A number of ways in which the use of EIA information could be enhanced is explored in this thesis. Foremost, the improvement of the effectiveness of EIA requires a wider adoption of a decision-making perspective on EIA, and a broader recognition of the information needs of the different decision processes for which EIA is prepared.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">environmental impact analysis</field><field name="subject">environmental policy</field><field name="subject">environmental law</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070202.121126</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Construction of entrepreneurship in publicly-owned utilities in New Zealand : local and translocal discourses, 1999-2001</field><field name="creator">Cardow, Andrew Graeme</field><field name="description">This research project examines how managers in local-government-owned business organisations justify their adoption of an entrepreneurial orientation and their interpretation of their role in entrepreneurial terms. To explore these justifications, interviews were conducted with the senior management of four local-government- owned business operations and one local council. They were: Metrowater, The Edge, Taieri Gorge Railway, Chatham Islands Council and Chatham Islands Enterprise Trust. These interviews were then analysed, utilising a critical discourse method. In addition, interviews were also conducted with senior managers in the Rotorua District Council and Taupo District Council who provided a sharp contrast to the former organisations and suggested a means by which the neo-liberal approach within the sector might be countered. 
 Through speaking with the various local govermnent business managers contacted for this project, I concluded that managers of local-government-owned business operations have a strong institutional identification with the private sector. This identity is so strong that many of the managers interviewed have rejected the very notion that they are public employees of any sort. The managers have adopted an entrepreneurial approach because they see this as essential to gain professional legitimacy with their peers in the private sector. This has caused them to place distance between themselves and the owners of the business that they manage (that is, the councils), and the local citizens they ostensibly serve, to the extent that they have described their job as providing goods and services to customers rather than providing services for citizens. I will show that the adoption of such an attitude is inappropriate when placed within the context of local-government-owned and operated business concerns. 
 From the point of view of European settlement, New Zealand is a very young country, especially in the administrative sector.

Haxby</field><field name="description">Background: In the clinical examination of patients with low back pain (LBP), musculoskeletal physiotherapists routinely assess lumbar spinal segmental motion by performing physical examination procedures such as observation of active range of motion and palpation of intervertebral motion. The validity of manual assessment of segmental motion, however, has not been adequately investigated. 
 Methods: In this pragmatic, multi-centre, criterion-related validity study, 138 consecutive patients with LBP were recruited and examined by physiotherapists with postgraduate training in musculoskeletal manual therapy. Clinicians examined each patient&#65533;s spine for the presence of segmental motion abnormalities, described as lumbar segmental rigidity (LSR) and lumbar segmental instability (LSI), then referred the patients for flexion-extension (FE) radiographs. The physical examination procedures of interest were: 1) assessment of forward-bending (FB) active range of motion (AROM); 2) FB and backward-bending (BB) passive physiological intervertebral motion testing (PPIVMs) in the sagittal plane; and 3) central postero-anterior passive accessory intervertebral motion testing (PAIVMs). Sagittal displacement kinematics of the lumbar spinal segments were measured from the FE radiographs, and served as the criterion standard against which the clinical assessment results were compared. The kinematic parameters measured were sagittal rotation, sagittal translation, ratio of translation per degree of rotation (TRR), instantaneous axis of rotation (IAR), and centre of reaction (CR). Reference ranges for normal motion were calculated from the analysis of FE radiographs of 30 asymptomatic volunteers. The accuracy and validity of the clinical examination procedures were then calculated, and reported as sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratios for a positive test (LR+) and a negative test (LR-). 
 Results: In patients with LBP, sagittal rotation LSR and sagittal translation LSR had a prevalence of approximately 5.7% (p &lt;0.0005) in this cohort. Sagittal rotation LSI was not found in statistically significant numbers. Sagittal translation LSI was found at a prevalence of 3.6% (p &lt;0.05). Abnormal TRR (23.3%), IAR (17.7%), and CR (16.5%) were more prevalent findings (all p &lt;0.0005). Observation of the quantity of AROM, during FB, is not valid for the assessment of either total lumbar segmental sagittal rotation, or detection of individual segments with abnormal segmental motion. PPIVMs and PAIVMs are specific, but not sensitive, for the detection of rotation LSI and translation LSI. A positive test (grade 4 on a scale from 0 to 4) with BB PPIVMs may have some utility for the diagnosis of rotation LSI or translation LSI, with LR+ of 8.4 and 7.1 respectively (and 95% CIs from around 1.7 to 38). Likelihood ratio statistics for FB PPIVMs were not statistically significant. A positive test (grade 2 on a scale from 0 to 2) with PAIVMs may have some utility for the diagnosis of rotation LSI or translation LSI, with LR+ of 2.7 and 2.5 respectively (and 95% CIs from around 1.01 to 7.5). Neither PPIVMs nor PAIVMs were useful for the detection of LSR, or abnormal quality of motion as measured by TRR, CR, and IAR. 
 Conclusions: Abnormal spinal segmental motion is associated with the symptom of LBP, in patients presenting to physiotherapists with a new episode of recurrent or chronic LBP, however prevalence is low due to highly variable lumbar segmental motion among asymptomatic individuals. Manual physical examination has moderate validity, but limited utility on its own, for the detection of translation LSI. Further research should investigate the utility of other clinical examination findings for the detection of lumbar segmental mobility disorders.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">backache</field><field name="subject">low back pain</field><field name="subject">lumbar vertebrae</field><field name="subject">diseases</field><field name="subject">diagnosis</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070205.094640</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fat embolism and cardiovascular changes during vertebroplasty in an animal model</field><field name="creator">Aebli, Nikolaus</field><field name="description">The studies documented here have demonstrated that similar to joint arthroplasty, VP causes FE with cardiovascular changes. Following the augmentation of each VB there is a transient acute response affecting the homeostasis of the cardiovascular system. This response is biphasic. Phase 1 was seen within 3 s after the beginning of bone cement injection and is likely to be due to a autonomous nerve reflex. Phase 2 was observed within ~16 s, reaching a peak response after ~30 s returning to a steady state between I and 5 minutes (approximately 10 % below pre-injection baseline). Consequently multiple VP caused baseline cardiovascular variables to progressively deteriorate. This fundamental response occurred whether bone cement or bone wax was used. A vent-hole did not prevent the peak response but attenuated the progressive deterioration of the baseline. 
 Pathomechanism of Fat Embolism: The exact mechanism(s) responsible for the cardiovascular responses to FE are still not entirely clear. However several theories have been put forward in the literature (see Chapter 1). The present studies have eluciated the role of some of these variables. 
 The primary mechanism responsible for FE has been attributed to an increase in IMP (Breed, 1974; Engesaeter et al., 1984; Orsini et al., 1987, Hofmann et al., 1999). The present investigation measured the IMP during VP and found that the peak increase in IMP (&gt;500mmHg) was similar to that reported for arthroplasty. The consequences of an increase in IMP are 1) a release of bone marrow content into the venous system and 2) a likely stimulation of nerve endings within the bone marrow cavity. By using transoesophageal echocardiography, this thesis provides evidence that the emboli originate from the bone marrow cavity and not from the agglutination of plasma fat. 
 Because the cardiovascular response was seen in the first seconds after the pressurisation (phase 1) and before the bone marrow content had reached the lung, it is most likely that this reaction was triggered by a nerve reflex. On the basis of either an up regulation of the vagus or a down regulation of the sympathetic tone. Pressurisation with bone cement and bone wax caused similar cardiovascular deterioration, which clearly gives evidence that bone cement monomer is not the only factor in this process. In the vent-hole group there was also a similar phase 1. Although the IMP was not measured in this group it is likely that the peak IMP was less in the vent hole group but still exceeding the threshold for nerve reflex stimulation. 
 After the initial cardiovascular response (fall in HR and MABP) a secondary cardiovascular response occurred (phase 2). Two possible mechanisms responsible for phase 2 are: 1) the effect of the released bone marrow content and its mediators on the pulmonary and systemic vascular system and 2) continuous stimulation of nerve endings within the VB caused by the pressure of the injected material. 
 Phase 2 was characterised by an increase in PAP and CVP and a decrease in MABP starting ~16 seconds after the beginning of the bone cement / bone wax injection. The time and response pattern for phase 2 was similar for each augmentation (VP1-VP2) and similar between the groups. This similarity gives evidence that the peak responses were a result of a reflex vasoconstriction of the lung vessels to the microembolisation of bone marrow particles (Byrick et al., 1989; Woo et al., 1995). Other authors also have reported that an increase in PVR was observed during FE (Wheelwright et al., 1993; Byrick et al., 1994), but this work is the first to suggest that a pulmonary vasoconstriction reflex may be involved. 
 This is the first study which measured the cardiovascular responses during FE continuously, unlike other studies which measured responses after 3 to 5 minutes (Wheelwright et al., 1993; Byrick et al., 1994). In the vent-hole group, Q was also measured during the transient response and therefore it was possible to calculate the PVR. The results showed that PVR was increased 3 to 5 times the pre-injection value at the peak response proving evidence that an increase in PVR is likely to be responsible for the increase in PAP and CVP and the decrease in MBP 
 Based on the observation that the wax and non-vent hole groups had similar peak responses to the vent hole group for PAP, CVP and MBP it can be concluded that PVR responses are also similar for all the groups. 
 The bone cement and the bone wax group had similar peak responses, therefore bone cement monomer can not solely be responsible for the vasoconstriction of the lung vessels. Although the amount of the fat was likely to be reduced by using a vent-hole the peak responses were similar. This suggests that even a reduced amount of bone marrow content released in the vent-hole group exceeded the 'threshold' for initiating a reflex response. 
 The fact that a certain threshold has to be reached to initiate a reflex response may explain why only a small percentage of patients develop FE during arthroplasty. Small amounts of bone marrow may not trigger the reflex. This finding is of significant clinical relevance as far as VP is concerned. To prevent the initiation of the reflex during injection of bone cement for VP or implantation of a prosthesis has to be performed as slowly as possible to reduce the amount of bone marrow content released into the circulation which reduces the risk of triggering reflex pulmonary vasoconstriction. 
 The problem with medium viscosity bone cement used in this study is that it cures too rapidly. Therefore it is essential to find a bone cement material which can be injected much slower to reduce the amount of bone marrow content released and, consequently, the chance of triggering a nerve reflex. 
 These findings are also relevant for joint arthroplasty. By reducing the injection pressure less bone marrow content is released into the circulation and the chances of initiating this reflex mechanism are minimised. 
 Future studies are required to measure the cardiovascular changes by injecting bone cement at low speed. Because such bone cement is not yet available, it would be possible to use calcium phosphate cements instead. A similar amount of fat would be released but whether the magnitude of the cardiovascular effect is altered would be interesting to explore. 
 The recovery of PVR was responsible for the recovery of MABP. This was quicker in the bone wax group compared to the group where bone cement was used. It is therefore likely that the bone cement monomer has a vasoconstrictor effect on the vascular system of the lung. Alternatively bone cement has been implicated in the increase of circulation levels of coagulating substances such as thrombin or fibrinopeptides (Dahl et al., 1988; Sharrock et al., 1995). However we could not demonstrate that bone cement monomer altered the peak reflex response. 
 Several authors have implicated bone cement monomer as having an effect on the cardiovascular system (Berman et al., 1974). This is the first study which provides compelling evidence that bone cement plays a role during FE. 
 The peak response for HR was different in the bone wax group compared to the cement groups. With bone wax HR decreased during phase 2 whereas with bone cement HR gradually increased. 
 From the previous study we know that the fall in MABP and HR in phase 1 is caused by a nerve reflex (Chapter 3). This would normally result in an increase in sympathetic activity. In the bone cement group the primary peripheral vasoconstriction response was attenuated resulting in a secondary increase in HR in order to restore MABP. This dulled response may be attributed to the bone cement monomer. However in the bone wax group the sympathetic response caused a severe and rapid vasoconstriction to restore MABP. Therefore an increase in HR did not happen and HR dropped further in phase 2. 
 This result may have a major impact on the clinical use of bone cement in the future, especially when treating patients with cardiovascular risk factors. 
 Baseline Changes: The injection of five consecutive VB in the same animal caused a progressive decrease in MABP in all groups. The fall in MABP was primarily correlated to SVR. The fall in SVR is mostly likely caused either by: 1) vasoactive substances, or 2) a decrease in sympathetic tone. 
 A vent hole was able to attenuate the progressive decrease in MABP. Because the quantity of bone marrow content released into the circulation was lower in the vent-hole group, compared to the bone cement group, the amount of vasoactive substances would also be lower in this group. This suggests that vasoactive substances are responsible for the decrease in SVR. The quantity of injected PMMA was not different between the vent hole and bone cement group. Therefore, the methylmethacrylate monomer does not seem to play a major role in the development of the fall in baseline MABP during multiple VP. 
 The fact that the decrease in MABP was similar in the bone cement and bone wax group supports this theory as well, since a similar amount of bone marrow is released. 
 Blood Gas Changes: In the present study, multiple VP induced prolonged hypoxaemia, hypercapnia and acidosis. According to the literature, the likely cause for these changes in arterial blood gases is ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) mismatch and pulmonary shunting, which is a consequence of the fat and marrow particles causing microembolisation of the pulmonary vessels (Modig et al., 1974; Pitto et al., 1998). The V/Q mismatching may also be accentuated by mediators causing pulmonary vasoconstriction (Woo et al., 1995). The severity of V/Q mismatch is likely to be correlated to the amount of bone marrow reaching the lung which was similar in the bone wax and bone cement group. A vent hole reduced the amount of fat released and therefore the mismatch. Consequently, PaCO2 and pHa did not significantly change and the fall in PaO2 in the vent hole group was less than the bone cement group. Similarly, Pitto et al. (1999) reported that the hypoxaemia that normally develops during hip arthroplasty, can be prevented if a vent hole is drilled into the distal femur and a vacuum applied. 
 Clinical Implications: Surgeons have to be aware that FE occurs during VP and is similar to what happens during arthroplasty. Therefore VP can potentially cause hypotension, cardiac arrest and even death (personal communication with Prof. Jens R. Chapman). The potential risk increases with the number of augmented VBs. As a result of the current work it has been shown that a maximum of 3 - 4 VBs can be augmented safely in one operation and that cardiovascular monitoring is mandatory. A vent hole is also recommended to attenuate the adverse cardiovascular response. The use of bone substitute material does not reduce or prevent the risk of FE and consequently similar precautions are recommended.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">fat embolism</field><field name="subject">cardiovascular system</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070205.103827</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Bedsharing vs cot-sleeping : an investigation of the physiology and behaviour of infants in the home setting</field><field name="creator">Baddock, Sally Anne</field><field name="description">Bedsharing between infants and parents interacts with many factors to increase the risk of SIDS, eg maternal smoking, alcohol or drug consumption, overtiredness, excessive bedding and younger infant. However, bedsharing also encourages breastfeeding, settles babies, reduces parental tiredness and increases mother-baby interactions. We studied infants in the natural setting of their own home, in their usual situation (bedsharing or cot-sleeping) to identify risks and benefits, and to understand how bedsharing could be made safer for all infants. 
 Methods: Overnight home video and physiological recordings of 40 bedshare infants (5-27 weeks), were compared with 40 cot infants matched for age and study season. Video data provided a log of infant/parent sleep positions, movements and interactions. The physiological recordings measured respiratory pattern, respiratory airflow, inspired CO2, oxygen saturation (SaO2), heart rate and core, peripheral and environmental temperatures. 
 Results: All infants maintained normal core temperatures overnight although bedshare infants had a higher shin temperature [35.43 vs 34.60&#176;C at 2hrs after sleep onset (difference 0.83, 95% CI: 0.18 to 1.49)]. Bedshare infants had thicker bedding (RR:2.35 (95% CI:1.76 to 3.14) and more face covered time [0.9h/night vs 0.2 (RR:5.62, 95% CI: 3.08 to 10.25)]. Awakenings in the bedshare group were more common, of shorter duration, and caused less change in infant temperatures. 
 Exposure to &gt;3% CO2 occurred in 18 bedshare infants and 1 swaddled, cot-sleep infant. The maximum exposure time was the same for both groups (60mins). These levels of CO2 significantly (p&lt;0.05) elevated breathing rate and maintained normal SaO2. Central apnoeas of 5-10 seconds resulted in drops in SaO2 &lt;90% (BS mean 6.8/night vs cot: 3.1, p&lt;0.001). SaO2 rarely fell below 85% and heart rate did not ever fall below 90bpm. 
 Bedshare infants commonly slept on their side, while cot infants slept supine. Prone sleeping was rare (BS:5 infants, 1.6-3.5h/night vs cot:2, 8.9-10.2) and for bedshare infants involved sleeping on mother&#65533;s chest. Bedshare infants woke and fed more frequently (mean wake times/night: 4.6 vs 2.5), but total sleep time was not different. Maternal checks were more frequent in the bedshare group (median:10, IQ range:7-23, max:55) than cot ( 4, 3-6, 16) and bedshare mothers frequently responded to infant initiated movements. During bedsharing baby and mother usually slept facing each other, touching, with infants at mothers&#65533; breast level. Father (or sibling) contact was rare. 
 Conclusions: Bedshare infants sleep in a warmer environment and experience more potentially dangerous events such as head-covering and rebreathing. However, all infants in this study maintained normal rectal temperature and SaO2 suggesting they were protected by homeostatic responses. Infant safety is also facilitated by frequent maternal checking and maternal responses to infant movements. The mother-infant proximity during bedsharing allows prompt responses, reduces time infants are upset, and minimises disruption from frequent breast feeding - aspects valued by many. It is not known if infants of smoking mothers or parents with impaired responses eg due to alcohol, respond adequately to the potentially dangerous situations identified.

 The study employed a non-equivalent pre-test post-test design. Participants were 80 candidates for coronary artery graft replacement and/or heart valve repair or replacement operations who were 60 years of age or over. Participants underwent a neuropsychological assessment pre-operatively, daily assessments between post-operative days 2-5 for identification of delirium, and a follow-up neuropsychological assessment 12 weeks post-operation. 
 Twenty-one participants met DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for delirium early post-operation. Participants who experienced delirium performed worse than participants who did not on one global cognitive measure and one specific cognitive domain at follow-up. However, this was likely due to the contribution of other factors such as age, years of schooling, pre-operative performance, and neurological events post-operation. There was no difference in the proportion of participants who did or did not develop delirium who met specified criteria for cognitive decline from pre-operation to follow-up. 
 Significantly more participants who developed delirium, relative to those who did not, met criteria for pre-existing cognitive impairment. After taking into account pre-existing impairment and other potentially contributing variables, delirium was a significant predictor of performance on an attentional task at follow-up. 
 There were no significant differences between the cognitive profiles of participants who did or did not develop delirium, at pre-operation or at follow-up. At both time points the profiles of these groups resembled the profile of a group of patients with vascular dementia. 
 In conclusion, although participants who experienced delirium performed worse on certain cognitive domains, this appeared to be due to factors other than delirium. However, after taking pre-existing cognitive impairment, and other relevant variables into account, delirium adversely affected attentional performance. Delirium was associated with a vascular dementia profile, but this profile was not specific to delirium. 
 Study findings have both theoretical and clinical implications. Consistent with the theoretical literature, the findings support impaired brain reserve as a risk factor for delirium, and the hypotheses that a combination of impaired brain reserve and events associated with delirium are responsible for subsequent cognitive performance. However, in the case of attention, events associated with delirium appear to be responsible for poorer performance, possibly due to the persistence of impaired attention, which is an essential feature of the delirium episode. A further theoretical implication is that individuals who experience delirium may be particularly vulnerable to developing vascular dementia, however, there needs to be further investigation of this risk in a non-cardiac surgery population. Clinically, study findings highlight the need to investigate possible cognitive impairment in individuals with cardiovascular disease, and in persons who experience delirium. When indicated, appropriate monitoring and/or treatment strategies should be employed to reduce the impact of cognitive deterioration.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">delirium</field><field name="subject">cognition</field><field name="subject">heart</field><field name="subject">surgery complications</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070205.120554</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Culture, values and Japanese tourism behaviour</field><field name="creator">Watkins, Leah</field><field name="description">While the role of culture as an influence on consumer behaviour and product/service choice has long been acknowledged, the current literature in marketing offers an incomplete understanding of how and why culture plays its influential role (Overby, Woodruff and Gardial 2005). Research suggests that values provide the link between culture and consumer behaviour and values have been the focus of much research in the social sciences. In particular, values have received significant attention in cross-cultural research, being used to characterise the similarities within and differences across cultures. Values are central to the marketing discipline as they determine value, i.e. what activities, interests, and material goods consumers identify with, enjoy, acquire, or consume (Grunert and Muller 1996). Both directly and indirectly, values drive consumption behaviour. 
 Typically, values have been assessed and compared through the use of standard measures such as Rokeach&#65533;s Value Survey, the List of Values and Schwartz&#65533;s Value Survey. Recent literature highlights growing concern over the application of standard measures across cultures and issues of cross-cultural invariance. There is a need for new research into cross-cultural applications of consumer value measures and theoretical models. This thesis critiques the use of Western conceptual paradigms and imposed etics in value research, and, using a Japanese tourism context, seeks a deeper understanding of how culture and values affect tourism consumption and experience. 
 This thesis offers an empirical test of the cross-cultural applicability of a commonly used values scale in consumer research, the List of Values (Kahle 1983). The findings of this phase of the research extend the literature concerning methodological issues in values research and highlight the limitiations of the LOV as a cross-cultural measure of values. Based on these findings the thesis adopts an alternative, qualitative methodology to investigate the relationship between Japanese culture, values and tourism behaviour in New Zealand. The findings of the second phase of the research contribute to a recent call in the literature for more qualitative research in tourism, and allow the identification and understanding of the key values relevant to Japanese tourism behaviour. The results of Means-End interviews with Japanese visitors reveal the important cultural assumptions informing values and shaping tourism decisions and behaviours for two key groups of Japanese tourists. 
 The theoretical framework presented in this thesis promotes our understanding of the relationship between cultural beliefs, values, and consumer behaviour. The results of the primary research highlight the importance of cultural and physical history, world-view, self-concept, thought patterns and language in the formation and interpretation of values. The thesis presents a holistic attempt at understanding Japanese culture, values and travel behaviour by examining how these concepts cohere in a logical framework. The thesis argues that, given the inherently cultural nature of values, their interpretation within the context of cultural beliefs is highly important in understanding variability in consumer behaviour across cultures.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Japanese</field><field name="subject">Japan</field><field name="subject">travel</field><field name="subject">tourists</field><field name="subject">tourism</field><field name="subject">attitudes</field><field name="subject">social values</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070205.150926</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Is historic Christian opposition to feticide intellectually defensible in the 21st century?</field><field name="creator">Flannagan, Matthew</field><field name="description">In this work, I argue that the Alexandiran position on feticide found in Hellenistic Judaism and appropriated by patristic, medieval and reformed theologians is defensible in the 21st Century. I formulate an argument from the Alexandrian position as it appears in several representative Christian traditions. This argument contends that that: [1] killing a human being without justification violates the law of God, [2] a formed conceptus (i.e. a fetus) is a human being and [3] that in the case of feticide (at least in the majority of cases) no justification is forthcoming. 
 In developing my case, I argue that the objections raised against the premises of this argument by contemporary philosphers are unsound. I defend the intellectual acceptability of belief in and appeals to the existence of a divine law, the notion that a formed fetus is a human being and the claim that feticide lacks any justification in the vast majority of cases. 
 In addition, I examine and critique theologians who claim the Alexandrian position is motivated by misogyny and those who claim it appropriates a translation error found in the Septuagint. 
 I conclude that the traditional position is defensible and that contemporary dismissals of it are unconvincing.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">abortion</field><field name="subject">fetus</field><field name="subject">moral and ethical aspects</field><field name="subject">religious aspects</field><field name="subject">Judaism</field><field name="subject">Christianity</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070208.095157</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Governing for theologia : governance of Presbyterian ministry formation in the Presbyterian Church of Aotearoa New Zealand 1961-1997</field><field name="creator">Jones, Susan Margaret</field><field name="description">This study of the governance of theological education examines significant policy and management decisions within Presbyterian ministry training in New Zealand between 1961 and 1997 in the light of Edward Farley&#65533;s integrated goal for theological education, theologia. Edward Farley&#65533;s argument that theologia, integration of theology (scientia) and theology (habitus), was fragmented from the first use of modern research university education as professional education for ordained ministry in the 1880s, provides a theoretical framework for analysing the influence of governance on theologia, through its effect on institutional organisation, structure and curricula. 
 International unease about theological education is reflected in New Zealand Presbyterian ministry formation, though little sustained critical analysis is yet published in New Zealand. The period under study begins in 1961 when the Special Committee on Theological Training called for a Chair in Pastoral Theology to 1997 when the Presbyterian Church of Aotearoa New Zealand opened its Centre for Advanced Ministry Studies, later renamed the School of Ministry. 
 Criteria signifying recovery and/or fragmentation of theologia drawn from Farley&#65533;s arguments are searched for in the beginning of University theology at Berlin and the beginning of ministry formation in Dunedin, New Zealand. The intervening time till 1960 is similarly analysed. Governance decisions about Pastoral Theology in the first case study and governance decisions about University, church and theology in the second, are then assessed. Constant rearranging of pastoral theology programmes symptomises increasing fragmentation of theologia as does the creation of a Pastoral Chair. Pastoral theology is left with the integrative responsibility, rendering other disciplines more scientific as feared by some Theological Hall teachers. Outside the University from 1876-1946, New Zealand Presbyterian ministry formation was still influenced by University expectations from Scotland and Berlin. After 1946, teaching within the University of Otago Faculty of Theology, Presbyterian teachers enjoyed considerable opportunities for integrated teaching. Fragmentation of theologia was therefore delayed and to some extent retarded. Increased University influence from 1992 meant these opportunities were lost. Finally, around the 1996 withdrawal of direct University engagement with Presbyterian ministry formation, formational goals were set for the Church&#65533;s new Centre of Advanced Ministry Studies. These aimed to integrate theology (scientia) and theology (habitus) retrospectively for ordinands after foundational theological education elsewhere. Earlier 1990s governance decisions affected achievement of these goals. 
 This work argues that between 1961 and 1997 most governance decisions in New Zealand Presbyterian ministry formation exacerbated existing structural fragmentation of theologia. Differing arrangements to alleviate this were attempted, and integration of (scientia) and (habitus) occurred for some students and at different periods. Structurally, however, the University-approved four-fold programme continued, making pastoral theology&#65533;s role remained ambiguous and theologia&#65533;s fragmentation inevitable. 
 While the New Zealand Presbyterian Church set its own ministry formation goals from 1961-1997, finance, prestige and educational philosophy prevented development of its own programme. Time and money were put into supporting University theology instead, and the University used to produce an educated ministry. It is now inevitable that the Church has to integrate theology (scientia) and theology (habitus) retrospectively for its students after theological education elsewhere.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Presbyterian Church of Aotearoa New Zealand</field><field name="subject">training of clergy</field><field name="subject">Pastoral theology</field><field name="subject">study and teaching</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070208.104312</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Rights of public access for outdoor recreation in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Booth, Kay Lenore</field><field name="description">This thesis explores the nature of public access rights for outdoor recreation in New Zealand. It aims to improve understanding of these rights by examining the New Zealand public policy framework for public access, the social constructions of access rights and the interaction of these dimensions via analysis of two contemporary New Zealand access issues: the foreshore access debate and the state-sponsored Land Access Review. An institutional arrangements framework forms the study&#65533;s conceptual basis and is critiqued for its value in the examination of rights of public access. Multiple qualitative methods were employed to collect data, including interviews with access actors, submission analysis, examination of public policy documents and critical interpretation of the access discourse within the mass media. Key themes from the international access literature are identified and the disparate nature of much of this research is highlighted. Within New Zealand, public access represents an area of research neglect. This thesis provides the first comprehensive study of rights of public access for outdoor recreation in New Zealand. 
 A threshold has been reached in the evolution of access rights in New Zealand. Societal changes are perceived to be reducing the public&#65533;s traditional rights to access land for outdoor recreation. Owing to the importance of these rights within conceptions of New Zealand national identity, the Government is codifying access rights in a bid to protect them. Thus a shift in access arrangements is occurring, from reliance upon social customs to increasing use of public policy instruments. 
 Access rights are being renegotiated within a highly contested environment. The debate is being staged within the political arena and via the national news media; access has become a significant national issue. As a result, the level of engagement has shifted from localised access transactions between landholders and recreationists, to a national discussion regarding competing rights to land. Access actors have reacted in different ways to the reforms of access arrangements, driven by the manner in which the proposals affect their property rights, social values and norms. Some reactions have been strident and confrontational. 
 Inadequate public policy arrangements for access have created the 'space' for these multiple social constructions of access to develop. Convergence of a disparate and poorly enforced access public policy framework with varying social representations of access rights is influencing the access outcomes. The 'place' of public access within New Zealand society occurs at the intersection of several strongly-held cultural traditions, including private property rights, Maori customary rights, and a belief that it is a birthright to freely access the outdoors. The tension between these values underpins New Zealand&#65533;s unique (and changing) manifestation of the rights of the public to access land for recreation.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">recreation areas</field><field name="subject">access</field><field name="subject">right of way</field><field name="subject">law and legislation</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070208.142035</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A partitioned narrative model of the self : its linguistic manifestations, entailments, and ramifications</field><field name="creator">Pang, Kam-yiu S.</field><field name="description">Contrary to common folk and expert theory, the human self is not unitary. There is no Cartesian theatre or homunculus functioning as a metaphorical overlord. Rather, it is an abstractum gleaned from a person&#65533;s experiences-a centre of narrative gravity (Dennett 1991). Experiences are a person&#65533;s cognisance of her ventures in life from a particular unique perspective. In perspectivising her experiences, the person imputes a certain structure, order, and significance to them. Events are seen as unfolding in a certain inherently and internally coherent way characterised by causality, temporality, or intentionality, etc. In other words, a person&#65533;s self emerges out of her innumerable narrativisations of experience, as well as the different protagonist roles she plays in them. Her behaviours in different situations can be understood as different life-narratives being foregrounded, when she is faced with different stimuli different experiences/events present. 
 In real life, self-reflective discourse frequently alludes to a divided, partitive self, and the experiences/behaviours that it can engage in. In academic study, this concept of the divided and narrative-constructivist self is well-represented in disciplines ranging from philosophy (e.g., Dennett 1991, 2005), developmental psychology (e.g., Markus &amp; Nurius 1986; Bruner 1990, 2001; Stern 1994), cognitive psychology (e.g., Hermans &amp; Kempen 1993; Hermans 2002), neuropsychology (e.g. Damasio 1999), psychiatry (e.g., Feinberg 2001), to linguistics (e.g., McNeil 1996; Ochs &amp; Capps 1996; Nair 2003). Depending on the particular theory, however, emphasis is often placed either on its divided or its narrative-constructivist nature. This thesis argues, however, that the two are coexistent and interdependent, and both are essential to the self&#65533;s ontology. Its objectives are therefore: (i) to propose a partitioned-narrative model of the self which unifies the two perspectives by positing that the partitioned-representational (Dinsmore 1991) nature of narratives entails the partitioned structure of the self; and (ii) to propose that the partitioned-narrative ontology of the self is what enables and motivates much of our self-reflective discourse and the grammatical resources for constructing that discourse. Partitioning guarantees that a part of the self, i.e., one of its narratives, can be selectively attended to, foregrounded, objectified, and hence talked about. Narrativity provides the contextual guidance and constraints for meaning-construction in such discourse. This claim is substantiated with three application cases: the use of anaphoric reflexives (I found myself smiling); various usages of proper names, including eponyms (the Shakespeare of architecture), eponymic denominal adjectives (a Herculean effort), etc.; and partitive-self constructions which explicitly profile partitioned and selectively focal narratives (That&#65533;s his hormones talking). When analysed using the proposed model, these apparently disparate behaviours turn out to share a common basis: the partitioned-narrative self.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">narrative discourse analysis</field><field name="subject">self</field><field name="subject">self-consciousness</field><field name="subject">psycholinguistics</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070213.103815</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Something to do with community structure : the influence of sampling and analysis on measures of community structure</field><field name="creator">Anderson, Barbara J.</field><field name="description">Diversity indices confound two components: species richness and evenness. Community structure should therefore be evaluated by employing separate measures of the number of species and their relative abundances. However, the relative abundances of species are dependent on the abundance measure used. Although the use of biomass or productivity is recommended by theory, in practice a surrogate measure is more often used. Frequency (local or relative) and point-quadrat cover provide two objective measures of abundance which are fast, less destructive and avoid problems associated with distinguishing individuals. However, both give discrete bounded data which may further alter the relative abundances of species. These measures have a long history of use and, as the need for objective information on biodiversity becomes more pressing, their use is likely to become more widespread. Consequently, it seems appropriate to investigate the effect of these abundance measures, and the resolution at which they are used, on calculated evenness. 
 Field, artificial and simulated data were used to investigate the effect of abundance measure and resolution on evidence for community structure. The field data consisted of seventeen sites. Sites from four vegetation types (saltmeadow, geothermal, ultramafic and high-altitude meadow) were sampled in three biogeographical regions. Most of the indices of community structure (species richness, diversity and evenness) detected differences between the different vegetation types, and different niche-apportionment models were fitted to the field data from saltmeadow and geothermal vegetation. Estimates of community structure based on local frequency and point-quadrat data differed. Local frequency tended to give higher calculated evenness; whereas point-quadrat data tended to fit to niche apportionment models where local frequency data failed. 
 The effect of resolution on the eighteen evenness indices investigated depended on community species richness and the particular index used. The investigated evenness indices were divided into three groups (symmetric, continuous and traditional indices) based on how they ranked real and artificially constructed communities. Contrary to Smith and Wilson&#65533;s recommendation the symmetric indices E[VAR] and E[Q] proved unsuitable for use with most types of plant data. In particular, E[Q] tends to assign most communities low values and has a dubious relationship with intrinsic evenness. The continuous indices, E[MS] and E[2,1], were the indices best able to discriminate between field, artificial and simulated communities, and their use should be re-evaluated. Traditional indices used with low resolution tended to elevate the calculated evenness, especially in species-rich communities. The relativized indices, E[Hurlbert] and EO[dis], were an exception, as they were always able to attain the minimum of zero; however, they were more sensitive to changes in resolution, particularly when resolution was low. Overall, traditional indices based on Hill&#65533;s ratios, including E[1/D] (=E[2,0]), and G[2,1] gave the best performance, while the general criticism of the use of Pielou&#65533;s J&#65533; as an index of evenness was further substantiated by this study. As a final recommendation, ecologists are implored to investigate their data and the likely effects that sampling and analysis have had on the calculated values of their indices.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">population biology</field><field name="subject">statistical methods</field><field name="subject">sampling (statistics)</field><field name="subject">ecology</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070215.150836</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Inclusion and exclusion in early childhood education : three case studies</field><field name="creator">Purdue, Kerry Ellen</field><field name="description">This research is based on three case studies, each of which involved a critical examination of how early childhood centres responded to children with disabilities. The first case study involved gathering information at seven full-day workshops undertaken at seven locations in the North and South Islands of New Zealand. The early childhood teachers, other professionals and parents who attended these workshops provided information on centre policies with regard to children with disabilities and on their own views about issues in this area. The second case study involved participant observation and interviews in a kindergarten across ten months. In this setting, I was actively involved in the daily programme, looking at how the kindergarten responded to Craig, a child with severe disabilities, and his family. The third case study involved participant observation and interviews in a childcare centre across ten months. In this setting, I looked at how the centre and its community included Peter, a child with Down Syndrome, and his family. In each of the case studies I was interested in understanding how children with disabilities may be included in early childhood settings and how some children with disabilities may experience exclusion from such centres. 
 The data from the three studies were theorised from a social constructionist position that suggests that our understandings of the world are made evident in the way in which we name and talk about issues. Within this theoretical position, it is through discourse that knowledge and meaning about a phenomenon are formed and produced. Discourses function as a system of rules giving authority to what may be said and thought in relation to a particular subject. In the present case, the focal subject was disability. From the case studies it was evident that two particular discourses had significant and contrasting implications for policy and practice in early childhood education. A medical-model discourse that saw disability as a condition of an individual child in need of "special" education and treatment was related to children with disabilities experiencing discrimination and exclusion. A discourse of inclusion in which disability was viewed as part of a continuum of human experience was related to policy and practice that was focussed on the elimination of barriers, and to full participation in early childhood settings. The thesis suggests that removing barriers to participation is consistent with a social justice approach to disability that acknowledges the need for both redistributive justice through resource allocation, and respect for differences through justice as affirmative cultural recognition.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">children with disabilities</field><field name="subject">education (early childhood)</field><field name="subject">early childhood special education</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070202.115120</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The adsorption of heavy metals by waste tea and coffee residues</field><field name="creator">Utomo, Handojo Djati</field><field name="description">This thesis is concerned with the use of natural waste materials, specifically used tea leaves and coffee grounds, as adsorbents for the removal of trace metals from water, e.g. in waste water treatment. Trace metals such as lead, mercury, zinc, copper, nickel and cadmium are released to the environment in waste water as a result of human activities, and generate concern because of their potential toxicity, persistence and tendency to become concentrated in food chains. While there are many conventional methods for removing these metals from waste water, such as chemical precipitation, ion exchange, membrane technologies and electrochemical treatment, these processes can be expensive. Thus in recent years there has been increasing interest in low cost adsorbent materials as alternative adsorbents, particularly waste natural products such as rice hulls and spent coffee grounds. 
 Most of the research reported in this thesis has been conducted with spent coffee grounds, both grounds produced by leaching of commercial ground coffee and spent grounds obtained from the manufacture of instant coffee. However, some preliminary work was also conducted using spent tea leaves. 
 In the initial work, the adsorption of the metal ions Cu&#65533;&#8314;, Zn&#65533;&#8314;, Cd&#65533;&#8314; and Pb&#65533;&#8314; by these adsorbents was investigated using batch adsorption methods to determine the effects of pH, metal ion concentration, adsorbent concentration and other factors such as temperature and metal ion competition. The competitive effects of soluble material leached from the adsorbents that also bind metal ions were studied. 
 The adsorption of the metal ions was found to follow the Langmuir adsorption isotherm. However, the maximum adsorption density was found to depend on the concentration of coffee adsorbent present. Further investigation indicated that this was a result of flocculation of the coffee solids, which acted to reduce the available surface area and thus the maximum density of adsorption sites. This was confirmed using a dispersant to break up the flocculated solids. 
 Column adsorption studies showed that metal ions adsorbed by coffee grounds could be quantitatively leached in dilute acid solution without any loss of subsequent adsorption properties, thus promoting efficient re-use of the column for many adsorption cycles. The adsorbent was also found to be largely unaffected by biological degradation. A prototype waste water treatment column was used to treat tap water samples, with and without known additions of metal ions. The results showed that the grounds efficiently adsorbed trace metal contaminants at levels as low as [mu]g L&#8315;&#65533;. 
 The acid base chemistry of both tea leaves and coffee grounds, and the soluble materials leached from the fresh tea and coffee, were studied using potentiometric titration. In addition the stoichiometry of H&#8314; released during metal ion adsorption was also investigated. The latter results indicated that the stoichiometry of metal ion adsorption is not simple, i.e. it probably involves more than one type of adsorption site. 
 The results of this thesis suggest that the use of waste coffee grounds shows considerable promise for the treatment of waste water containing trace metals, and provides an alternative commercial use for such exhausted coffee materials.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">heavy metals</field><field name="subject">absorption and adsorption</field><field name="subject">tea</field><field name="subject">coffee</field><field name="subject">analysis</field><field name="subject">sewage purification</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070207.132040</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of colour and odour in fruit selection by diurnal, endemic skinks (Oligosoma) in Aotearoa / New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Marshall, Jane Elizabeth</field><field name="description">The flora of Aotearoa/ New Zealand has evolved in association with birds and lizards as the dominant frugivores and seed dispersers. There is a wide range of ripe fruit colours within the native fleshy-fruited plants spanning the visible light spectrum from red to violet, with the notable exception of green. The evolution of fleshy-fruit and fruiting related trait, may be a result of the selection pressures exerted by different frugivore guilds. This study was conducted to ascertain if endemic diurnal lizards, Oligosoma species (Scincidae: Lacertilia), display features associated with visual based foraging, colour sensitivity and colour preferences, which are necessary conditions to infer a co-evolutionary mutualism between fleshy-fruited plant species and lizards as seed dispersers, which may have influenced the evolution of fruit colour. 
 Many lizards have exceptional colour vision, with the ability to see a wide range of the visual light spectrum from short wave ultra violet to long wave red. They are able to discriminate all aspects of colour: hue, brightness and saturation. 
 Fruit colour within Coprosma (Rubiaceae), is extremely variable, between and within species. The study of fruit colour preferences within this genus and particularly within species with polymorphic fruit colour provides a valuable comparison of frugivore preference to fruit with little inter and intraspecific variation, therefore minimising potentially confounding factors due to phylogeny. 
 Fruit-colour choice experiments were conducted offering fruit from two colour categories based on postulated frugivore preferences; red and red orange fruit has been associated with avian frugivores whilst white and pale fruit has been associated with lizard frugivory in New Zealand. Experiments were conducted both ex-situ, in environmentally controlled laboratories and in-situ at Macraes Flat, Otago. Pilot trials indicated that the background colour on which fruit were presented was important in fruit choice and consequentially, all fruit were offered on a background which provided contrast to both fruit colour categories. The laboratory trials showed some weak evidence for a preference of white and pale blue fruit however, in-situ trials showed a strong preference for white over red fruit. 
 Field studies were conducted to ascertain the composition of fleshy-fruit in the diets of lizards and the results were consistent with those expected for a generalist omnivore; many of the small fruits available to lizards were consumed however, the results indicated that plant abundance does not adequately explain fruit consumption at this field site. A preference index showed that white and pale fruited plants, Melicytus alpinus and Coprosma spp., were preferred over more abundant orange and red fruited plants. 
 Fruit odour was investigated to determine if fruit choice was mediated primarily by visual cues as opposed to odour cues. Fruit choice trials with the fruit concealed from view indicated that fruit choice was based primarily on visual cues in Oligosoma skinks. 
 It is concluded that lizards demonstrate the necessary conditions to infer that as frugivores, they may have influenced the evolution of fruit colour and that within the open habitats of Aotearoa/ New Zealand, the shrubs, particularly the divaricate shrubs may have provided sufficient environmental conditions to establish a mutualism between plants and lizards resulting in the evolution of small, white and other low chroma fruits.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">skinks</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">feeding and feeds</field><field name="subject">fruit</field><field name="subject">color</field><field name="subject">flavor and odor</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070209.154142</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The identification of mathematical ability and of factors significant in its nurture</field><field name="creator">Daniel, Coralie</field><field name="description">This thesis reports data gathered through case studies of ten of the students who took part in a survey of secondary school students who had been invited to camps at which the New Zealand teams were chosen for the International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) in the first five years of this country&#65533;s participation in the IMO. The case studies data gave individuals&#65533; narratives that were captivating yet complex, unique yet universal, clear yet not easily described all of apiece.

In most of the families, all members were encouraged to follow their own inclinations and interests, to respect the maintenance of a balance of cultural and physical activities, to regard books and play as normal life supports, and to believe that discovery, enchantment and pleasure were both goals and accomplishments of everyday life. 
 Most of the students experienced less encouragement at school than they might have expected, and unpleasant experiences could be linked with a teacher&#65533;s apparent lack of appreciation of a student&#65533;s mathematical ability. Both the case studies and the initial survey suggested that most teachers, at any level of formal education, were doing all they were capable of doing in mathematics, and that the students responded to opportunities to self-select subjects and topics that interested them and to the help and company offered by mentors and peers who had flair and competence in appropriate subject areas. 
 Few of the case studies students were motivated by strategies dependent on a high level of competition or a 'sorting' of that offered in formal education (through attitudes and practical organisation such as timetabling) into either Arts or Science subjects. Most were attracted to the study of languages and/or philosophy and some to that of computer science. Most showed interest and some prowess in individual cultural and physical activities requiring perseverance. Largely, they were motivated by finding fresh or novel ways of integrating diverse knowledge, and by associating with peers. They enjoyed and valued self-awareness, intellectual independence, chances to empathise with ideas and people, and tasks that were in harmony with the dictates of their own volition. 
 Evidence of differences among the case studies students - even though they had all been identified as very able in mathematics - led me to Vadim Krutetskii&#65533;s theories of the components of mathematical ability and their functioning and thus to new views, first, of the interplay between aptitude and languages of perception, inner comprehension and outer expression and, second, of the relationships between giftedness and other attributes of human abilities and endeavours. These appreciations suggested that the models of education and support commonly exhibited in the case studies students&#65533; families and in the environments of their extra-school activities had been more encouraging of their gifts, talents and personal growth than those often exhibited in the schools they attended.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">mathematical ability</field><field name="subject">gifted children</field><field name="subject">education</field><field name="subject">psychology of learning</field><field name="subject">International Mathematical Olympiad</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070212.105323</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Gender, family responsibilities and career success in the New Zealand accountancy profession</field><field name="creator">Whiting, Rosalind Heather</field><field name="description">This study contributes to an understanding of the causes, consequences and complexities of gender inequity in career success (high levels of status and salary) in the New Zealand accounting profession. Sixty-nine (twenty-seven male and forty-two female) experienced Chartered Accountants were interviewed about their career histories. A feminist, interpretative and qualitative approach was followed and NVIVO was used for analysis. The first significant contribution of the study was the identification of five work/family strategies based on levels of family and work involvement (Traditional Men, Traditional Women, Family Balancers, Stepping Stone Men and Work First Women). 
 Secondly, the level of family responsibilities explained career success much better than gender alone, although these two factors were commonly (but not always) directly related. 
 The third contribution was the revision of the three-pronged model previously offered by Whiting &amp; Wright (2001) to explain gender inequities in salary and status in the New Zealand accounting profession. Because the original model was derived from quantitative data, using qualitative data to revise the model constituted a sequential mixed method (pragmatic) approach. In the revised model, gender centrality and the three explanatory categories (Attributes, Structure and Attitudes) were removed. Career success was enhanced by high career aspirations (related to perceptions of stress, managerial and responsibility requirements and remuneration), long working hours and availability to clients, hard work, high technical competence and skills (enhanced by overseas experience), networking (less attractive to women), self-confidence (enhanced by mentoring for the least self-confident), flexibility to relocate if required (decreased by family and lifestyle ties) and large size and growth of the employing organisation. 
 Most influential were career aspirations and a long hours/available work ethic. This demonstrated the pervasiveness of the male linear career model (derived from the male breadwinner-female carer family structure), that rewarded (in terms of progression) unilateral allegiance to the firm. Career aspirations, desire for responsibility, perceived ability to handle pressure, long hours, availability to clients, networking and possibly technical skills (if there were periods of extended leave) were all influenced by the Chartered Accountant&#65533;s level of family responsibilities. Those with the least family responsibilities (childless, Traditional Men and Work First Women) demonstrated unswerving commitment to the firm and were equally the most successful career wise. 
 The impact of family responsibilities on career progression could be ameliorated by organisational cultural change. There were some indications of cultural change, being most prevalent in public sector and educational organisations. Enhancing conditions included a culture of flexibility and a concurrent atmosphere of trust, a less competitive work culture, absence of constant overtime demands and on-call work, encouraging top management who worked positively to retain and foster top performers over a longer period, and high level part-time positions supported by well-trained subordinate teams. To achieve these conditions provides an imminent challenge to organisations which employ Chartered Accountants, because the profession is increasing its proportion of females, has a younger generation more interested in work-life balance, and is losing many of its members overseas.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">accounting</field><field name="subject">vocational guidance</field><field name="subject">work and family</field><field name="subject">job satisfaction</field><field name="subject">success</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070214.145101</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Iron and microevolution in Mesorhizobia</field><field name="creator">Carlton, Timothy M.</field><field name="description">Genome plasticity in soil bacteria is predicted to be evolutionarily advantageous, allowing bacteria to sample genetic variation for adaptation to local soil ecology. In the field population of mesorhizobia where the symbiosis island (ICEMlSym[R7A]; an I&#818;ntegrative C&#818;onjugative E&#818;lement) was first identified, individual members were found to have significant chromosomal variation downstream of the phe-tRNA gene or phe-tRNA integrated ICEMlSym[R7A]. However, the nature of this genetic variation and whether it contributed to the adaptation of the indigenous mesorhizobia to their field environment were unknown. 
 This work focused on a nodule isolate, Mesorhizobium sp. strain R88B, a member of the indigenous mesorhizobial population that received ICEMlSym[R7A] from strain R7A. The region downstream of ICEMlSym[R7A] was sequenced, revealing three distinct regions of non-conserved DNA, totalling 34.5 kb. Integrated directly downstream of ICEMlSym[R7A] was IMEMlAdh[R88B], a 24.3-kb novel I&#818;ntegrative M&#818;obilisable E&#818;lement. Using a PCR-based assay, it was shown that the IMEMlAdh[R88B] integrase could excise not only IMEMlAdh[R88B], but also a dual-IMEMlAdh[R88B]/ICEMlSym[R7A] hybrid, indicating the potential mobility of IMEMlAdh[R88B], and a likely evolutionary intermediate of a novel ICE. However, a functional role for MadA, (a putative adhesin and the sole adaptive trait encoded on IMEMlAdh[R88B]) was not discovered. Southern hybridisations with the mesorhizobial population provided evidence for the existence of a novel family of IMEs in the mesorhizobia, which, by diversifying their internal sequences, provide allele-specific variation to the population. 
 The two other regions downstream of IMEMlAdh[R88B] possessed no obvious mobile genetic element structures, and only the region adjacent to the core-chromosome encoded ORFs with putative functions. Mutation of two of these ORFs, fhuD1 and fhuB1, identified their function as two of the four components of a ferrichrome ABC-uptake (Fhu) system. Using genetic screens, the remaining components of this transporter were mapped to two separate loci. Thus, the functional transporter in R88B was a composite of at least two independently-acquired Fhu systems. The genetic screens also revealed that ferrichrome utilisation was dependent on a TonB energy-transduction system encoded downstream of the Fhu ATPase gene, fhuC. 
 Expression studies on the three fhu loci demonstrated that, despite their separate acquisition, their expression was coordinately up-regulated in response to low-iron conditions. Bioinformatics on the predicted promoter regions of the fhu genes identified the binding site of the rhizobial Fur analogue, RirA, which is likely to be responsible for this expression profile. 
 Southern hybridisations of DNA isolated from members of the mesorhizobial population revealed the three fhu loci were not conserved in the mesorhizobial population. The presence of FhuA was the best predictive marker for the trait. It is proposed that multiple rounds of acquisitions and recombinations, both illegitimate and legitimate, formed this transporter, with the constant need for iron offset by the negative selection pressure of FhuA being a target for phage. None of the Fhu-specific genes was present in the sequenced M. loti strain MAFF303099 though flanking sequences were, further emphasizing the role of genome microevolution in forming the Fhu phenotype.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Rhizobium</field><field name="subject">genetics</field><field name="subject">microbial genetics</field><field name="subject">nitrogen-fixing microorganisms</field><field name="subject">molecular genetics</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070215.154441</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Topics in torsion theory</field><field name="creator">Charalambides, Stelios</field><field name="description">The purpose of this thesis is to generalize to the torsion-theoretic setting various concepts and results from the theory of rings and modules. In order to accomplish this we begin with some preliminaries which introduce the main ideas used in torsion theory, the major ones being [tau]-torsion and [tau]-torsionfree modules as well as [tau]-dense and [tau]-pure submodules. In the first chapter we also introduce a new concept, that of a [tau]-compact module, which is basic enough to deserve a place among the preliminaries. 
 The results that we obtain fall into three areas which are to a certain degree interrelated. The first area is on [tau]-Max modules, which we introduce as a torsion-theoretic analogue of Max modules. The main aim is to generalize a well-known result by Shock which characterizes Noetherian rings by using the socle, the radical and Max modules. All of these concepts have torsion-theoretic counterparts which we utilize in our generalization. Furthermore, we define and characterize left [tau]-Max rings and apply the torsion-theoretic version of Shock&#65533;s theorem to obtain a characterization of [tau]-short modules motivated by a recent article in which short modules were introduced. 
 The second area deals with various flavours of [tau]-injectivity, some known and some new. We introduce [tau]-M-injective and s-[tau]-M-injective modules and examine their relationship with the known concepts of [tau]-injective and [tau]-quasi-injective modules. We then provide an improved version of the Generalized Fuchs Criterion which characterizes s-[tau]-M-injective modules, and give a generalization of Azumaya&#65533;s Lemma. We also prove that every M-generated module has a [tau]-M-injective hull which is unique up to isomorphism and show how this is linked to the [tau]-quasi-injective hull. We then examine [Sigma]-[tau]-injectivity, generalizing well-known results by Faith, Albu and Na&#774;sta&#774;sescu and Cailleau which provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the [Sigma]-[tau]-injective property, the [Sigma]-s-[tau]-M-injective property and for a direct sum of [Sigma]-s-[tau]-M-injective modules to be [Sigma]-s-[tau]-M-injective. 
 In the third area we introduce a couple of new concepts with the aim of bringing to the torsion-theoretic setting the concept of a CS or extending module. The approach is twofold. The first is via [tau]-CS modules which serve as a generalization of CS modules as well as [tau]-quasi-continuous, [tau]-quasi-injective and [tau]-injective modules, and the second is via s-[tau]-CS modules which are a special case of CS modules. Our motivation is to provide a torsion-theoretic analogue of a well-known result by Okado which characterizes Noetherian modules. We have some partial results using s-[tau]-CS modules and a nice torsion-theoretic analogue, albeit without the use of [tau]-CS or s-[tau]-CS modules. We also examine the relationship between our relative versions of CS modules with those of other authors and obtain refinements to some of their results.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">torsion theory (algebra)</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070216.161043</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The One-China controversy, 1996-2002 : the impact of Taiwan&#65533;s democratisation on the cross-strait policies of Taipei, Beijing and Washington</field><field name="creator">Lin, Chin-sheng</field><field name="description">The one-China issue before the 1990s was not particularly complex as both sides of the Taiwan Strait claimed that there was only one China in the world and Taiwan was part of China. Nevertheless, after Taiwan accelerated democratisation in the early 1990s, and especially after 1996 when it entered a stage of democratic consolidation, the one-China issue has become a bitter controversy. 
 Taiwan was transformed from an authoritarian regime to a democracy through the revision of the constitution and the reform of elections for the Legislative Yu&#776;an and the presidency between 1991 and 1996. Democratisation not only legitimised the government&#65533;s rule on Taiwan, but also brought about Taiwanese nationalism, which forced the government to defend the sovereignty to which its democratic and economic achievements now entitled it. As the PRC has always claimed sovereignty over Taiwan, the one-China controversy has thus focused on Taiwan&#65533;s international status since the 1990s. In order to prevent Taiwan from declaring independence, the PRC adopted a carrot and stick strategy, but failed. Its "peaceful reunification" policy and the "one country, two systems" formula could not attract the Taiwanese, and its military threats were blocked by the US, which has strongly demanded a peaceful resolution for cross-Strait disputes since 1979. 
 As the US also needs the PRC&#65533;s cooperation in many international areas, it did not support Taiwan&#65533;s formal independence. Under such circumstances, maintaining the status quo of the Taiwan Strait becomes the best choice for the three sides. The one-China controversy is not expected to be resolved in the near future. 
 Democracy has been promoted as a universal value since the Cold War. As Taiwan has not ruled out the possibility of future democratic unification with the Mainland, the best way to resolve the one-China controversy might be the successful democratisation of the PRC, which the international community would welcome.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chinese reunification question (1949-)</field><field name="subject">democratization</field><field name="subject">foreign relations</field><field name="subject">politics and government</field><field name="subject">China</field><field name="subject">Taiwan</field><field name="subject">United States</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070220.142540</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Burning out or burning desire? : investigating athlete burnout and engagement in elite New Zealand athletes</field><field name="creator">Lonsdale, Christopher Sean</field><field name="description">This thesis examined the utility of Self-Determination Theory (SDT; Deci &amp; Ryan, 1985; Ryan &amp; Deci, 2002) as a framework for understanding athlete burnout and its hypothesized opposite - athlete engagement. Athlete burnout was defined as "a psychological syndrome of emotional/physical exhaustion, reduced sense of accomplishment, and sport devaluation" (Raedeke, 1997, p.398). Athlete engagement was defined as a persistent, positive, cognitive-affective experience in sport that is characterized by vigour, dedication, and confidence. Based on the predictions of Vallerand&#65533;s (1997; Vallerand &amp; Losier, 1999) motivational model, it was hypothesized that elite New Zealand athletes with higher perceptions of competence, autonomy, and relatedness (i.e., basic psychological needs) would also report more self-determined motives to participate in sport and that individuals with higher self-determined motivation would experience lower athlete burnout and higher athlete engagement. Before testing these hypotheses four preliminary studies were necessary. First, because of the nomadic lifestyles of many elite athletes, it was decided that an online survey delivered via the Internet would be the most appropriate and effective method for collecting data to test the central hypotheses. However, a literature search revealed that no studies in sport psychology had compared online and traditional paper and pencil survey methods and therefore a preliminary study was needed to investigate potential survey format effects. Results of measurement invariance and latent mean structures analyses indicated that there were no differences on the Athlete Burnout Questionnaire for randomly assigned online (n=117) and paper and pencil (n=97) groups. Second, recent research (e.g., Martens &amp; Webber, 2002; Riemer, Fink, &amp; Fitzgerald, 2002) has indicated that the only published measure of behavioural regulations (i.e., motives) in sport (Pelletier, Fortier, Vallerand, Tuson, &amp; Blais, 1995) has psychometric problems. Therefore, it was necessary to develop a reliable and valid measure of behavioural regulations in sport. Following rigorous scale development procedures that included expert review and pilot testing, results from two studies (n=382 and n=343) supported the reliability and validity of this new measure - the Behavioural Regulations in Sport Questionnaire. 
 Third, while researchers in organizational and educational psychology have examined engagement experiences, no research has investigated athlete engagement. Results of a qualitative inquiry with elite New Zealand athletes (n=15) indicated that vigour, dedication, and confidence were core athlete engagement dimensions. Fourth, items for a quantitative athlete engagement questionnaire were created using operational definitions from the qualitative study and then reviewed by athlete burnout and positive psychology experts. Analysis of data from two samples (n=382 and n=343) supported the reliability and validity of the Athlete Engagement Questionnaire. Results from the final study (n=343) investigating the relationships amongst basic needs, behavioural regulations, burnout, and engagement generally supported the main hypotheses of the thesis. Indeed, athletes with higher perceptions of autonomy and competence reported more self-determined regulations; however, relatedness was not a significant predictor. Athletes&#65533; levels of self-determined motivation accounted for substantial portions of variance in athlete burnout symptoms: emotional/physical exhaustion (R&#65533;=.13), sport devaluation (R&#65533;=.43) and reduced accomplishment (R&#65533;=.42). Behavioural regulations were also strong predictors of athlete engagement, accounting for 49% of the variance in vigour, 42% of the variance in dedication, and 30% of the variance in confidence. Implications of these results for researchers and practitioners are discussed. Directions for research concerning SDT, athlete burnout, and athlete engagement are also highlighted.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">burn out (psychology)</field><field name="subject">motivation (psychology)</field><field name="subject">autonomy (psychology)</field><field name="subject">psychological aspects</field><field name="subject">athletes</field><field name="subject">athletics</field><field name="subject">sports</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070220.144258</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Tuning mechanisms for quasi-phase-matched optical parametric oscillators</field><field name="creator">Lee, Chris J.</field><field name="description">Several pulsed optical oscillators (OPOs) based on periodically poled lithium niobate (PPLN) and pumped by single longitudinal mode Ti:sapphire lasers have been developed. These OPOs provide access to important spectroscopic regions in the 1 - 5.5 [mu]m region and can be rapidly turned by varying the pump wavelength. Previously many of the OPOs developed to take advantage of PPLN relied on a combination of period selection and temperature tuning and as a result were slow and cumbersome to tune. This problem my be avoided by using tunable pump sources or acoustically induced strain waves. 
 Several candidate OPO pump sources were characterised. These pump sources with themselves pumped by lasers operating at repetition reates of either 1.5 kHz (high repetition rate) or 10Hz (low repetition rate). High repetition rate systems include: a Ti-sapphire laser, injection seeded by a single longitudinal mode diode laser, several coupled cavity Ti:sapphire lasers with bandwidths less than 100 Ghz and Cr:forsterite lasers narrowed by prisms and e&#769;talons. The low repetition rate systems were all coupled cavity Ti:sapphire lasers one of which was single and double pass amplified. Of these it was found that only the high repetition rate injection seeded laser and the low repetition Ti:sapphire lasers were suitable as OPO pump sources. 
 OPOs were characterised at high and low repetition rates. The high repetition rate system exhibited a low threshold of oscillation (18.7 [mu]J) and a low overall efficiency (25%) which was thought to be due to the pulse to pulse variability of the Ti:sapphire bandwidth. The tuning range of the OPO was 932 to 1310 nm (signal) and 1.989 [mu]m to 5.281 [mu]m (idler) using multiple poling periods and only 15 nm of pump tuning. OPO oscillation on two separate signals simultaneously was observed. Two separate low repetition rate systems were investigated; the first was tuned from 1200 to 1600 nm (signal) and from 1600 to 2400 nm (idler) on a single poling period with a high absolute efficiency of 35% and a threshold of 180 [mu]J. The second OPO was tuned from 940 to 1220 nm (signal) and 2.2 to 4.3 [mu]m (idler) on a single poling period. The absolute efficiency of the system was 25% and the threshold was 200 [mu]J. OPO oscillation on two separate signals was investigated using an OPO based on grazing incidence configured cavity. It was found that the signals coupled together through Raman transitions present in lithium niobate and that coupling reduced the efficiency of the device as a whole. 
 The affect of an acoustically induced strain field on the optical nonlinearity of tetragonal ferroelectric materials was investigated. It was found that the optical nonlinear coefficient varies linearly with the cell displacement and as the square root of the acoustic power. A crystal designed to implement a quasi phase matched interaction based on this variation is proposed.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">optical parametric oscillators</field><field name="subject">lithium niobate</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070220.145817</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Distribution of Hector&#65533;s dolphin (Cephalorhynchus hectori) in relation to oceanographic features</field><field name="creator">Clement, Deanna Marie</field><field name="description">Hector&#65533;s dolphin (Cephalorhynchus hectori) is an endangered coastal species endemic to New Zealand. Their distribution, like other marine organisms, is intertwined with the dynamics of their local habitats, and at a larger scale, the coastal waters around New Zealand. The main purpose of this thesis was to identify specific habitat requirements of this rare dolphin. 
 Hector&#65533;s dolphin distribution around the South Island was quantified along several temporal and spatial scales. Large-scale density analyses of abundance surveys found over half of the South Island&#65533;s current population occurred within only three main regions. Two of these strongholds are along the west coast and the third is located around Banks Peninsula on the east coast. Smaller-scale analyses at Banks Peninsula found the majority of the dolphin community was preferentially using core regions within the marine mammal sanctuary. Monthly surveys showed that in summer and autumn statistically more dolphins occurred within inshore regions ([less than or equal to]one kilometre), spread throughout the surveyed coastline. From May through winter, dolphin densities rapidly declined. Remaining dolphins were significantly clumped in more offshore waters of eastern regions. The lowest encounter rates occurred between August and September. Certain 'hotspots' consistently had higher dolphin densities throughout the study period while others were preferred seasonally. 
 To address habitat preferences, surveys simultaneously collected oceanographic samples using a CTD profiler. In general, physical variables of the Peninsula&#65533;s eastern and southeastern waters varied less, despite being regularly exposed to upwellings and the varied presence of sub-tropical waters. Semi-sheltered bays and shallow inshore waters were highly variable and more susceptible to spatially discrete influences, such as localised river outflows and exchange events. Several hydrographic features were seasonally predictable due to their dependence on climate. The stratification and location of the two dominant water masses (neritic and sub-tropical) accounted for over half of the temporal and spatial variability observed in oceanographic data. 
 Possible relationships between oceanographic features and aggregations of dolphins within Banks Peninsula were examined using global regression and a spatial technique known as geographical weighted regression (GWR). GWR models out-performed corresponding global models, despite differences in degrees of freedom and increased model complexity. GWR results found relationships varied over localised scales that were concealed by global methods. Monthly GWR models suggested the seasonal presence and strength of local oceanographic fronts influenced dolphin distribution. Dolphin aggregations coincided with the steepest gradients between water masses along eastern regions of the Peninsula, and strong exchange events along the edges of the study area. 
 The continued survival of this endangered species is contingent on its protection. Long-term monitoring programmes are needed for the three main strongholds identified in this study. The occurrence of Hector&#65533;s dolphin 'hotspots' along frontal zones within Banks Peninsula also suggests alternative and increased protection strategies are needed for this sanctuary to be effective. In light of this thesis&#65533; findings and based on marine protection research, future sanctuaries need to consider why Hector&#65533;s dolphins are preferentially using particular regions and how their association with certain oceanographic features can help make informed decisions on more appropriate protected areas.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Hector's dolphin</field><field name="subject">dolphins</field><field name="subject">protection</field><field name="subject">habitat</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">South Island</field><field name="subject">West Coast</field><field name="subject">Banks Peninsula District</field><field name="subject">geographical distribution</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070221.122411</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Chromosome 18 and autoimmune disease</field><field name="creator">Hall, Richard James</field><field name="description">The autoimmune diseases embody a diverse range of common human conditions that are caused by a loss of self-tolerance in the host immune system to a specific organ or tissue type. Approximately 5% of the general population are affected by autoimmune diseases which include type 1 diabetes (T1D), rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and Graves disease (GD). The majority of the autoimmune diseases are multifactorial in origin, brought about by a combination of both environmental and genetic factors. Numerous susceptibility loci have been identified for each autoimmune disease and a number of these loci have been shown to be shared amongst the autoimmune diseases. The fine-mapping of susceptibility loci to the underlying disease genes remains the current challenge facing complex disease genetics. This project aimed to further characterise the autoimmune disease susceptibility locus IDDM6 on chromosome 18q12-21. This was achieved by using a comparative mapping approach that incorporates the study of genetic association in human autoimmune disease alongside the consomic mapping of the orthologous region in the non-obese diabetic (NOD) mouse model of autoimmunity. 
 Deleted in colorectal carcinomas (DCC) provided a strong candidate gene at IDDM6 and the resident R201G polymorphism was identified as a functional candidate A potential mechanism for the R201G polymorphism involvement in T1D aetiology was identified where the polymorphism may affect the ability of DCC to induce apoptosis in vitro. However, no evidence for R201G association could be detected in autoimmune disease case-control datasets from the New Zealand (NZ) population (T1D n = 428, RA n = 730, autoimmune thyroid disease n = 192 (AITD); versus n = 1246 healthy controls). In addition, no evidence for R201G involvement in T1D could be provided in a transmission disequilibrium test (TDT) incorporating 382 affected sib-pair families (54.2% transmission; P = 0.15). Significant association of R201G with GD was detected in a United Kingdom (UK) dataset (P = 0.002) from the Newcastle population (423 cases vs. 393 controls) but this was not replicated in an additional dataset from the UK Birmingham population (731 cases vs 668 controls; P = 0.81). It was concluded that the R201G polymorphism may encode susceptibility to GD but is unlikely to be the sole aetiological variant that accounts for the linkage previously observed at IDDM6 in autoimmune disease. To further investigate DCC as a positional candidate at IDDM6, five SNPs were selected from a 100 kb window surrounding a DCC-resident microsatellite that had previously been associated with T1D, called "88,21". The five SNPs were genotyped in the NZ T1D dataset, and the ascertainment of estimated haplotypes in this dataset revealed association of a rare haplotype with T1D, called haplotype H (3.31% cases vs 1.17% controls; P = 0.0044), in addition to global association of all haplotypes (P = 0.018). Haplotype H was also associated in an independent case-control dataset from the UK comprised of 400 T1D subjects and 443 healthy controls (P = 0.038). Maximum support for association of haplotype H was extended when both the UK and NZ T1D datasets were combined (P = 0.0017). Association of haplotype H could not be verified in a family-based test for association using the 382 UK T1D families (P = 0.40). However, the inclusion of the DCC SNPs in a TDT analysis of the published DCC-resident microsatellites "88,21" and "55,26", that had been used to identify IDDM6, extends support for the previously-associated 2-10 haplotype (2-10 refers to the published allele nomenclature at "88,21" and "55,26" respectively; 2-10-haplotype A; 59.6% T; P = 0.0058). There was no evidence for association of the five SNPs with RA or AITD when using either individual SNP analyses or estimated haplotypes in the NZ datasets. A similar lack of association was reported for the UK Newcastle GD dataset. Taken together, these data further support DCC, or a nearby gene, as conferring susceptibility to T1D. 
 The human genetic data that supports IDDM6 involvement in autoimmune disease is further strengthened by consomic mapping of the orthologous region in mouse, using the non-obese diabetic mouse (NOD) model of autoimmune disease. In this thesis, the first evidence for a diabetes and thyroiditis susceptibility locus on mouse chromosome 18 is presented, which have been designated Idd21 and Sat1 respectively. This was achieved by using a chromosome-replacement strain with chromosome 18 derived from the diabetes-resistant Biozzi ABH strain on a diabetes-susceptible NOD genome, called NOD.ABH[Chr&#65533;&#8312;]. Mouse chromosome 18 contains orthology to both IDDM6 and the rat diabetes-susceptibility locus Iddm3. The NOD.ABH[Chr&#65533;&#8312;] mice showed a dramatic and significant reduction in diabetes incidence (30% of females were affected by 7 months of age versus 85% in NOD; P &lt;0.0001) and that of thyroiditis (15.5% at 12 months compared to 37.4% in NOD; P &lt;0.002). 
 The comparative mapping of the chromosome 18 autoimmune susceptibility locus IDDM6 in human and mouse presented in this thesis provides further support for this locus. This research also clearly defines the next steps required to fine-map IDDM6 to the underlying disease genes, especially in regard to the DCC gene.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">chromosomes</field><field name="subject">autoimmune diseases</field><field name="subject">immunological aspects</field><field name="subject">immunology</field><field name="subject">molecular aspects</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070221.141018</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The velocity field of the South Island of New Zealand derived from GPS and terrestrial measurements</field><field name="creator">Henderson, Christopher Mark</field><field name="description">The measurements from eighteen GPS (Global Positioning System) surveys and four terrestrial surveys were used to calculate the velocities of 406 survey stations throughout the South Island, Stewart Island and the southernmost North Island. Repeated GPS measurements are available at 350 stations. The calculation of the velocities for the remaining stations is made possible through the use of terrestrial measurements. 
 The velocity was modelled under the assumption that the displacements of the stations are either linear with time or linear punctuated by discontinuities. The discontinuous model was used to estimate the coseismic displacements of stations in the vicinity of the 1994 Arthur&#65533;s Pass earthquake (M 6.7). The maximum station displacement was estimated to be ca. 40 cm, and significant displacements are seen to a range of ca. 70 km from the earthquake epicentre. Station displacements were also calculated for two later earthquakes in the vicinity of the Arthur&#65533;s Pass earthquake, but it was not possible to separate these from the postseismic displacements due to the earlier earthquake. 
 A continuous velocity field was estimated from the discrete station velocity measurements through a stochastic model based on the concept of minimum curvature. The selection of the basic stochastic model was effectively arbitrary; however, the model was refined to better suit the velocity field in the South Island. This was achieved through estimating the correlation between the velocity components (east and north) and the anisotropy of the velocity field. The stochastic model has the advantage over other models (e.g. polynomials or splines) in that only the probable shape of the velocity field is assumed. Therefore, the shape of the velocity field is not restricted by a priori model assumptions. 
 The measurement of the differential velocity across the South Island plate boundary between Christchurch and Cape Farewell is less than 85% of the interplate velocity calculated from NUVEL-1A. One possibility is that the NUVEL-1A model may not be an accurate representation of the motion at this plate boundary. Alternatively, deformation (occurring during the period of survey measurements) may extend a total distance of 150 km or more (assuming that the spatial velocity differential is less than 5x10&#8315;&#8311;/year) offshore from Christchurch and Cape Farewell. In the southern South Island there is evidence for as much as 22 mm/year of east directed motion being accommodated between Fiordland&#65533;s west coast and the stable interior of the Australian Plate. An accretionary wedge has been imaged west of Fiordland (Davey and Smith, 1983; Delteil et al., 1996); therefore, some of this deformation may be related to slip on the subduction interface. 
 The shear strain rates are clearly influenced by the dominant fault elements in the South Island, i.e. the southern and central Alpine Fault, and the eastern Hope Fault. The maximum measured shear strain rate in the South Island, 6(&#177;1) x10&#8315;&#8311;/year, occurs adjacent to the Alpine Fault at (1 70.5&#176;E, 43.3&#176;S), ca. 40 km northeast of Mt Cook, and is coincident with a local dilatational strain rate minimum, -7 (&#177;4.5) x 10&#8315;&#8312;/year. This is the only location where the measured strain rate is compatible with strike-slip and dip-slip motion on the Alpine Fault. Shear strain rates decrease eastwards along the Hope Fault: from 5(&#177;0.7) x10&#8315;&#8311;/year at the Alpine Fault, to 3(&#177;0.8) x10&#8315;&#8311;/year close to the Jordan Thrust. The zone of deformation broadens with a concomitant decrease in shear strain rate, such that within the northeast South Island there is no distinct maximum over any particular fault. 
 A band of contraction and shear has been imaged at a distance of 100 km southeast of, and parallel to, the Alpine Fault. The deformation at this location may be related to a frontal thrust zone similar to that described in the two-sided wedge models. The band of deformation continues north of Christchurch, intersecting the Porters Pass Fault Zone. 
 Significant contraction rates are seen in the measurements from four other zones. The first of these is situated towards the northeast (on land) ends of the Clarence, Awatere and Hope Faults. Some of this signal is presumably related to the uplift of the Seaward and Inland Kaikoura Ranges. The three remaining zones of significant negative dilatational strain rate are located north of the Wairau Fault, close to Jackson Bay and within central Otago. 
 A zone of significant shear strain rate is measured along the eastern side of, and within southern Fiordland. The deformation measurements probably partially reflect the existence of an important fault running through Lake Te Anau, which accommodates the motion of the Fiordland block relative to the Pacific Plate. The remainder may be due to internal deformation of the Fiordland block. 
 A new velocity differential measurement has been introduced, the rotational excess. This function of the shear strain rate, vorticity and dilatational strain rate should be sensitive to tectonic rotation (as measured by paleomagnetic data). Point estimates of the rotational excess are insignificant throughout the South Island. Also, there are no easily defined regions in which spatially averaged measurements are significant. If the rotational excess is assumed to be a direct measurement of tectonic rotation then the measurements place a bound on the size of the region and the rate at which it rotates. For example, the rate of tectonic rotation within a square region with side lengths of 50 km located adjacent to Cape Campbell is unlikely to be greater than 4&#176;/Ma. However, greater tectonic rotation rates are possible within smaller regions.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Global Positioning System</field><field name="subject">South Island (N.Z.)</field><field name="subject">geography</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070221.143821</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Perinatal hypoxia-ischaemia : neuroprotective strategies</field><field name="creator">Hobbs, Catherine E.</field><field name="description">Perinatal hypoxia-ischaemia is a major cause of disability, including cerebral palsy, yet a neuroprotectant which fully protects the brain remains elusive. Following a hypoxic-ischaemic insult, striatal medium-spiny neurons and hippocampal CA1 neurons are vulnerable to a complex cascade of neurotoxic events. This cascade includes energy failure, a massive release of glutamate, the formation of free radicals and caspase activation. The overall aim of this thesis was to assess the efficacy of three potential neuroprotective strategies that target this cascade from different directions. Short-term, and where appropriate, long-term, neuroprotection was investigated. The first treatment strategy aimed to suppress the generation of free radicals through treatment with the potent free radical spin trap, N-tertbutyl-(2-sulphophenyl)-nitrone (S-PBN). The second compound tested was the caspase-3 inhibitor, minocycline. Finally, the third treatment strategy combined a series of S-PBN injections with 6 hours of moderate hypothermia immediately after hypoxia-ischaemia. Hypothermia is suggested to slow the rate of the neurotoxic cascade, thus potentially allowing other neuroprotective agents greater efficacy. 
 Using an adaptation of the Rice et al. (1981) model, hypoxia-ischaemia was induced on postnatal day (PN) 8 in the right cerebral hemisphere. For the short-term studies, the rats were perfused at 14 days-of-age. The brains were dissected out and embedded in Technovit. Forty [mu]m serial sections were cut through the right striatum and hippocampus. The total number of medium-spiny neurons in the striatum and where appropriate, the total number of neurons in the hippocampal CA1 pyramidal layer, were stereologically determined using the optical disector/Cavalieri method. 
 For the long-term study, fine motor control was assessed in half of the animals through the staircase test from 9-11 weeks-of-age. Neuroprotection was assessed in the remaining animals. All animals were sacrificed at 12 weeks-of-age. The total number of striatal medium-spiny neurons was stereologically determined in the non-behavioural animals as described above. 
 A series of seven injections of S-PBN (100mg/kg) did not offer statistically significant neuroprotection to the striatum at one week after perinatal hypoxia-ischaemia. Similarly, a single injection of minocycline (45mg/kg) immediately after the insult did not offer significant neuroprotection to the striatum nor the CA1 region of the hippocampus at this early time-point. In contrast, when the series of S-PBN injections was combined with 6 hours of moderate hypothermia post-hypoxia-ischaemia, sterelogical analysis revealed significant neuroprotection of the striatal medium-spiny neurons to normal levels at one week after the injury. No significant neuroprotection was seen in the CA1 region of the same animals. 
 To assess whether this impressive striatal neuroprotection was long-lasting and whether it represented functional rescue, the final experiment in this thesis investigated rat pups at 12 weeks-of-age after exposure to hypoxia-ischaemia at PN8. Treatment with S-PBN/hypothermia offered persistent neuroprotection of striatal medium-spiny neurons and preservation of fine motor skills compared to diluent-normothermia-treated controls. The long-term behavioural outcomes were compared with normal, uninjured controls and the total number of medium-spiny neurons was compared with normal numbers from the literature. These comparisons revealed that the histological and functional integrity of the striatum was rescued to normal levels. 
 This is the first study to identify a treatment strategy that offers complete and long-lasting preservation of striatal neuronal numbers, by accurate and unbiased stereological methods, paired with persistent preservation of fine motor control following perinatal hypoxia-ischaemia.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">perinatology</field><field name="subject">nervous system</field><field name="subject">wounds and injuries</field><field name="subject">anoxemia</field><field name="subject">hypothermia</field><field name="subject">neuroprotective agents</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070221.145910</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Excited state structures of polypyridyl complexes : a spectroscopic and DFT study</field><field name="creator">Howell, Sarah Louise</field><field name="description">This thesis reports the spectroscopic and computational studies of a number of Cu(I), Re(I) and Ru(II) complexes of polypyridyl ligands. The ligands considered in this study were 1,10-phenanthroline, 4,7-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline, 3,4,7,8-tetramethyl-1,10-phenanthroline, dibenzo[b,j][1,10]phenanthroline, dipyrido[2,3-a:3&#65533;,2&#65533;-c]phenazine, dipyrido[2,3-a:3&#65533;,2&#65533;-c]-6,7-dichlorophenazine and dipyrido[2,3-a:3&#65533;,2&#65533;-c]-6,7-dimethylphenazine. 
 Density functional theory calculations were carried out on the polypyridyl ligands. Validation of the calculations was carried out by comparison of the predicted values to observables. The structures were compared to previously published X-ray crystal data. Calculated bond lengths were typically calculated to be within 0.02 A&#778; of those in the crystal structure. The calculated vibrational spectra were compared to measured IR and Raman spectra. The correspondence between calculated and measured frequencies was quantified using the mean absolute deviation between the two sets of frequencies. This was typically found to be less than 10 cm&#8315;&#65533;. The robustness of the calculation was further tested by calculations on perdeuterated analogues of some of the ligands. The calculations were extended to metal moieties and validated as for the ligands. 
 Resonance Raman and infrared spectra of the reduced states of some Re(I) complexes are reported. The structure and spectra have been modelled by considering the radical anion of the polypyridyl ligand and the reduced state of the complex. There is improvement in the mean absolute deviation, between calculated and observed frequencies, upon incorporation of the metal moiety into the calculation. Spectra are successfully modelled confirming the validity of the modelled structures. 
 The resonance Raman and infrared spectra of the metal-to-ligand charge transfer excited states of some Cu(I), Re(I) and Ru(II) complexes are reported. Density functional theory calculations on the lowest energy triplet states aided in the spectral assignment of bands. Cu(I) complexes were successfully modelled with mean absolute deviations, between calculated and observed frequencies, of less than 10 cm&#8315;&#65533;. The spectra of the Re(I) and Ru(II) complexes were less successfully modelled. Incorporation of the Ru(II) centre into the calculation of the vibrational frequencies of dipyrido[2,3-a:3&#65533;,2&#65533;-c]phenazine complexes offers no improvement over modelling the radical anion of this polypyridyl ligand. 
 The excited state lifetimes of a number of polypyridyl complexes have been reported. The changes in lifetimes of similar complexes were found to be consistent with the energy gap law or changes in the conjugation of the involved polypyridyl ligand. 
 This project has allowed the excited state structures of a number of polypyridyl complexes to be determined using vibrational spectroscopy to validate density functional theory calculations. This has provided a study strategy that may be applied to other metal polypyridyl complexes.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">complex compounds</field><field name="subject">spectrum analysis</field><field name="subject">ligands</field><field name="subject">raman spectroscopy</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070221.155843</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Oral delivery of bioactive compounds to the common brushtail possum (Trichosurus vulpecula)</field><field name="creator">McDowell, Arlene</field><field name="description">The common brushtail possum (Trichosurus vulpecula) is the most significant vertebrate pest in New Zealand as an ecological threat to the indigenous biodiversity and an economic threat as a vector for bovine tuberculosis. Biological control is considered to be the most accepted management strategy to reduce the population, specifically by impairing fertility. Successful development of a biocontrol agent (most likely a protein or peptide macromolecule) requires identification of a compound that is species-specific and potent. The challenge is also to deliver the bioactive to this free-ranging, widespread, feral animal and ensure sufficient bioavailability. Macromolecules have low oral bioavailability, thus new formulation strategies are required to enhance stability and absorption in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) of T. vulpecula. Oral administration of the bioactive contained within a non-toxic bait is the most practical delivery strategy. 
 Essential to designing an oral delivery system is to quantify the transit time of different sized delivery systems. The gastrointestinal transit in T. vulpecula was investigated (n = 72) by gamma scintigraphy. Technetium-labelled (99mTc) anion exchange resin particles (75 - 125 (mu)m or 500 - 700 (mu)m) or solution (99mTc-DTPA) was administered orally. After 3, 6, 12, 24 or 32 h, distribution of radioactivity in excised GITs was determined. Transit profiles were similar for each formulation. For delivery to the hindgut, bioactives need protection for 12 h though the upper GIT. Particulate formulations may be retained in the caecum for up to 32 h. Transit time was not different between animals dosed in the evening or the morning. Furthermore, GIT morphology is different between specimens in this study from southern New Zealand and Australian specimens. This may reflect improved diet quality in New Zealand. 
 A model protein (insulin) was incorporated into poly(ethyl 2-cyanoacrylate) (PECA) nanoparticles prepared by interfacial polymerisation of water-in-oil microemulsions. The mean size of nanoparticles was 220 nm with a mean entrapment efficiency of 78%, determined using reverse phase HPLC. In vitro release of insulin from PECA nanoparticles in phosphate buffer (0.067 M, pH 7.4) at 37&#176;C was triphasic and not all entrapped insulin was released. 
 Following in vitro incubation of nanoparticles with enzyme solutions prepared from the GIT of T. vulpecula, lumen enzymes were more aggressive towards insulin compared to mucosal enzymes and the hindgut lumen was the GIT region with the lowest degradation. 
 For the first time in a marsupial species, the in vivo pharmacokinetics of insulin-loaded, PECA nanoparticles were investigated following i.v. and intra-caecal administration and measured by radioimmunoassay. The low cross reactivity of human and endogenous brushtail possum insulin means that T. vulpecula is a suitable non-diabetic model to study pharmacokinetics of insulin. The i.v. pharmacokinetics of insulin solution and insulin-loaded nanoparticles were similar. On intracaecal dosing, co-administration of a permeation enhancer (EDTA) resulted in a small increase in plasma insulin concentration compared to insulin-loaded nanoparticles alone. 
 In conclusion, transit time to the caecum of T. vulpecula following oral delivery was 12 h for fluid and particulate formulations &lt; 1 mm diameter and was independent of the time of day the dose was given. T. vulpecula is a potential non-diabetic model for the study of insulin pharmacokinetics.

Although closely related to T. repens, T. ambiguum has unique and highly specific nodulation requirements and as rhizobial strains capable of effectively nodulating T. ambiguum are not naturally found in New Zealand soils, they must be introduced with the seed. Rhizobium leguminosarum bv. trifolii strains such as ICC105 form effective nodules on T. ambiguum but ineffective (Fix&#8315;) nodules on T. repens. The T. repens nodules nevertheless develop normally and contain bacteroids. R. l. bv. trifolii strains that are effective on T. repens such as NZP561, fail to nodulate T. ambiguum. As the host-specific nitrogen fixation defect of Caucasian clover rhizobia on T. repens has potentially adverse agronomic implications, the genetic basis for this Fix&#8315; phenotype was investigated. 
 Rhizobium leguminosarum bv. trifolii strain ICC105 was converted to Fix&#8314; on T. repens by the introduction of an 18-kb fragment of DNA from a white clover rhizobial strain (NZP514) symbiotic plasmid. This fragment contained several nif and fix genes, including nifHDKEN, fixABCX, nifA, nifB, fdxN and fixU. Tn5 mutation of these white clover rhizobial genes demonstrated that most were required to impart the Fix&#8314; phenotype on T. repens to ICC105, with the exception of nifA. Mutagenesis of the ICC105 nifA gene and subsequent complementation with various combinations of the white clover rhizobia nif/fix genes as well as transcriptional lacZ fusion studies of the ICC105 nifA and nifH genes demonstrated that ICC105 nifA is expressed and functional during the ineffective nodulation of T. repens and able to activate expression of nifHDKEN and fixABCX operons derived from white clover rhizobium but not from ICC105. 
 Sequence analysis and comparison of the intergenic region between the divergently transcribed nif/fix operons revealed a conserved 111-bp region found between the nifH/fixA promoters of Caucasian clover rhizobia, but not in white clover rhizobia. Attempts to modify this region in ICC105 failed in creating a strain which was Fix&#8314; on T. repens; however recombination of the nifHD/fixAB region from a white clover rhizobium into the ICC105 genome produced several strains with a &#65533;swapped&#65533; nitrogen fixation phenotype (i.e. Fix&#8314; on T. repens and Fix&#8315; on T. ambiguum). A hypothesis was therefore proposed by which differences in the nifH/fixA promoter regions of Caucasian clover rhizobia and white clover rhizobia modulate the expression of the upstream genes in response to the particular plant host they are nodulating. 
 The incompatibility between the symbiotic plasmid of R. l. bv. trifolii ICC105 and the white clover rhizobium symbiotic plasmid cointegrate, pPN1, was also investigated and potential regions of each plasmid involved in this incompatibility were identified. 
 The research presented in this thesis has contributed to the genetic knowledge of the nitrogen fixation genes, and regulation of these genes in R. l. bv. trifolii. It has also provided progress towards the goal of creating a suitable inoculant strain for T. ambiguum that is able to fix nitrogen in symbiosis with both T. repens and T. ambiguum.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">nitrogen-fixing plants</field><field name="subject">nitrogen fixation</field><field name="subject">clover</field><field name="subject">Rhizobium leguminosarum</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070306.155157</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The association of Escherichia coli and soil particles in overland flow</field><field name="creator">Muirhead, Richard William</field><field name="description">The entrainment of microbes from agricultural land into overland flow during rainfall events is recognised as an important source of pathogenic microbes to surface water bodies and yet this transport process is poorly understood. In this study, a method has been developed to separate bacteria into the forms in which they have been postulated to exist in overland flow. Then Escherichia coli was used as a model organism to investigate the transported state of bacteria eroded from cowpats and their subsequent transport in overland flow. Simulated rainfall experiments were used to generate runoff direct from cowpats. Concentrations of E. coli in the runoff direct from cowpats were found to be directly proportional to the concentration in the cowpat, regardless of the age of the cowpat. It was also observed that E. coli were predominantly eroded from cowpats as individual cells. The interactions between E. coli and soil particles in overland flow were then examined in a small laboratory scale model system and showed that E. coli attached to large (&gt;45 [mu]m) soil particles were transported significantly less than unattached cells. However, in the runoff from the model system, E. coli were found to be attached mainly to clay particles that were similar in size to the bacterial cells. Furthermore, the transport of E. coli through the model system appeared to follow the transport of a conservative chemical tracer implying that (a) the cells were being transported as a solute with the bulk of the water flow, and (b) that E. coli attached to small clay particles were as mobile in the overland flow as unattached cells. These observations imply that E. coli predominantly interact with small clay particles that are also being carried along in the overland flow. The transport of E. coli at a larger scale was then investigated using 5-metre long, 1-metre wide buffer strips operated under saturation excess conditions. In buffer strips using intact soils and existing pasture cover, E. coli removal was very poor (26 % removal) at the low flow rate of 2 L min&#8315;&#65533; with no removal observed at the higher flow rates of 6 and 20 L min&#8315;&#65533;. E. coli removal rates were increased to 41 % removal at 2 L min&#8315;&#65533; by cultivating the soils, with the removal rate again decreasing with increasing flow rate. E. coli in the overland flow from the buffer strips did not form into large flocs or attach to large soil particles, but were transported in small neutrally buoyant particles that remain entrained in the overland flow. Under saturation excess runoff conditions, E. coli in overland flow were not effectively removed by buffer strips as the small particles are transported either over the soil surface or, through large pores in the soil. This Thesis has shown that E. coli is transported in overland flow in small particle sizes that are difficult to trap or remove from overland flow thereby explaining the high fluxes of faecal bacteria observed in overland flow from agricultural land.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Escherichia coli</field><field name="subject">pathogenic microorganisms</field><field name="subject">dispersal</field><field name="subject">agricultural wastes</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070306.155953</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Heritable and early life growth factors affect arterial elastic tissue defect formation</field><field name="creator">Pascoe, Katie Clare</field><field name="description">A German pathologist first described defects in the elastic tissues of human arteries over one hundred years ago. Much evidence now supports the involvement of these elastic tissue defects (ETDs) in the initiation and progression of atherosclerosis, although this association is not well accepted. Recent research has determined that the migration of medial smooth muscle cells into the intima (and therefore the start of the atherosclerotic process) is initiated in an attempt to repair these defects and in addition, that there is a correlation between the extent of intimal thickening and the degree of elastic tissue disruption. The Brown Norway (BN) strain appears to have an increased predilection, having a significantly greater incidence of ETDs within the caudal and renal arteries and the abdominal aorta compared with other rat strains. These defects appear morphologically identical to those observed in the arteries of young humans. The purpose of this study was to determine the magnitude of the genetic and environmental components in the formation of these ETDs in the aorta. 
 Previous studies have demonstrated that the spontaneous formation of elastic tissue defects in the abdominal aorta of the Brown Noway rat is a genetically inherited phenotype, passed from parent to offspring in an autosomal dominant manner. Following crossbreeding of the BN rat with four other strains (two hypertensive and two normotensive) it was determined that, although the inheritance mode of the ETD phenotype followed an autosomal dominant pattern, the expression or penetrance of this phenotype was reduced in F&#8321; all crossbred groups. Moreover, the early postnatal growth profile of the F&#8321; pups appeared to be differentially associated with defect formation. To further examine the relationship between aortic ETDs and birthweight, a well-studied model of in utero growth restriction was investigated in the BN rat. On day 18 of a 23-day gestation the uterine arteries were ligated, which resulted in offspring that were 14% smaller than un-operated control pups. This short-term insult resulted in significantly increased numbers of ETDs in growth-restricted animals at 8 weeks of age, an effect that was also observed in 16-week old males. The effect of in utero growth restriction on ETDs in the guinea pig and ApoE knockout mouse was also examined, to determine if ETDs (and subsequent early atherosclerotic events) may be influenced by the exposure to a growth-restricting event in utero. Despite this work leading to the novel characterisation of ETDs in the guinea pig aorta, the growth restricting surgery resulted in poor maternal and pup outcomes, which limited the conclusions that could be drawn from these studies. 
 Furthermore, microarray techniques were employed to examine changes in aortic gene expression following growth restriction, by comparing amplified mRNA extracts from 8-week old growth restricted BN pup aortas with extracts from a group of average birthweight, un-operated BN pups. In combination, these studies propose both genetic inheritance and the in utero environment regulate elastic tissue defect phenotype, which in turn potentially affects the initiation and progression of early atherosclerosis.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">arteries</field><field name="subject">diseases</field><field name="subject">abnormalities</field><field name="subject">growth factors</field><field name="subject">elastic tissue</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070306.160709</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Axillary odour in apparel textiles</field><field name="creator">McQueen, Rachel</field><field name="description">The axilla is a major source of human body odour from which the characteristic musky, urinous or acidic odours emanate, and are predominantly due to bacterial metabolism of the protein-rich fluid secreted by the apocrine and sebaceous glands located in this area (Senol and Fireman, 1999). Clothing has been implicated in contributing to body odour intensity, possibly even increasing the intensity (Dravnieks, et al., 1968; Shelley, et al., 1953) by the transfer of secretions, skin debris and bacteria from the body to the fabric substrate. Despite much anecdotal evidence indicating that some fibres and fabrics are better at limiting odour intensity than others, there appears to be no published research confirming this. The purpose of this study therefore, was to determine whether fabrics varying in fibre content (cotton, wool, polyester) and fabric knit structure (interlock, single jersey, 1x1 rib) differed in the extent to which they retained and emanated axillary odour following wear, and whether the intensity of odour was linked to the number of bacteria transferred to the fabrics. A procedure for collecting odour on fabrics was developed as was a method for evaluating odour through use of a sensory panel. Total aerobic bacteria and aerobic coryneform bacteria extracted from the fabrics were counted to determine if an association between bacterial counts and fabrics existed. Sensory analysis recognises the unique capability of humans as odour-detecting instruments whereas, instrumental analysis has the potential to offer information on the concentration and identification of axillary compounds, which a human assessor cannot. To investigate a new method for detecting axillary odour on apparel fabrics, proton transfer reaction mass spectrometry (PTR-MS) was used to analyse volatiles emitted from fabrics differing in fibre type. 
 After removal of garments from the human body, axillary odour can be detected on fabrics, with the intensity of odour being strongly influenced by the fibre type from which the fabrics had been made. Polyester fabrics emanated odour of high intensity, cotton that of mid-low odour intensity, and wool fabrics were low odour. Fabric structural properties such as thickness, mass per unit area and openness of knit structure also had an effect on odour intensity. However, as the principal factor influencing odour intensity was fibre, only fabrics characterised by a high intensity (i.e. polyester) were influenced by structural properties. Differences in odour intensity among fabrics were not necessarily related to bacterial numbers, and no &#65533;inherent antimicrobial&#65533; properties were evident for any of the fabrics. Bacterial populations persisted in all fabrics up to 28 days. A decline in numbers was apparent for high-odour polyester fabrics, while numbers in low-odour wool fabrics remained relatively stable. PTR-MS detected compounds likely to be short-chain carboxylic acids which increased in the headspace above the polyester fabrics after 7 days. However, this increase was not evident for either the wool or cotton fabrics. Therefore, bacterial numbers per se cannot be a predictor of the odour intensity emanating from fabrics at least on the basis of these fabrics and fibres. The intensity of axillary odour emanating from fabrics was found inversely related to fibre hygroscopicity.

Gigi</field><field name="description">New Zealand&#65533;s fourteen deep-water fiords have complex physical and hydrographic features as well as strong environmental gradients, all of which may influence the population structure of organisms that inhabit the fiords. I examined the population structure of the brachiopod Terebratella sanguinea over ecological and evolutionary time scales in relation to physical and hydrographic features of the fiords. To further explore the role of larval dispersal in this system, comparisons between population genetic structure of T. sanguinea and a brachiopod with a contrasting larval dispersal strategy (Liothyrella neozelanica) were made. 
 Aspects of the life history of the articulate brachiopod Terebratella sanguinea were measured. I measured density and size throughout Doubtful Sound and growth at outer (5 km from outer coast) and inner fiord sites (13.5 km from outer coast). Additionally, reproductive periodicity was measured at a single site within Doubtful Sound. Terebratella sanguinea occurred at significantly lower densities and was significantly smaller at the outer fiord site (p &lt; 0.05), however growth rates between an inner and outer fiord site did not differ significantly. Terebratella sanguinea was found to have separate sexes and synchronous maturation of oocytes with spawning occurring in the austral winter. These results indicated that, on an ecological time scale, the environmental gradient of the fiords influences aspects of T. sanguinea population structure. 
 In order to determine the influence of the fiord environment on genetic population structure, patterns among T. sanguinea from across Fiordland were assessed using two genetic markers, and these data were compared to hydrodynamic variables. Ten sites (322 individuals) were included in a preliminary allozyme analysis, and 20 sites (358 individuals) were used for the amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) analysis. Patchy genetic differentiation was revealed with both markers, and a break between Long Sound and the other Fiordland sites was detected with AFLP markers. My results suggest hydrodynamic features of this region may isolate organisms that can disperse only during a planktonic larval phase, however this isolation is visible in genetic patterns only at the most extreme values of the hydrodynamic variables. 
 To better understand how the fiord environment influences population structure of organisms that disperse via planktonic larvae, I compared population genetic structure of two sympatric brachiopod species that differ in planktonic larval duration. Genetic analysis using the AFLP technique revealed population structuring corresponding to the contrasting modes of larval dispersal. AMOVA analysis indicated Liothyrella neozelanica, a brachiopod that broods its larvae, had more limited exchange among sites within a fiord than did T. sanguinea, a brachiopod that does not brood its larvae. In general, the fiord hydrographic conditions may be creating opportunities for local genetic differentiation (for example Long Sound) in organisms capable of longer distance dispersal, but organisms with lower potential for dispersal are more strongly influenced by ontogeny than by hydrography. 
 Understanding the population structure of some of the marine fauna of Fiordland is an important cornerstone for the developing management plan for the area. Conservation of the underwater resources of this World Heritage Area can be successful if the structure of the system and the mechanisms driving this structure are taken into account.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">brachiopoda</field><field name="subject">larvae</field><field name="subject">dispersal</field><field name="subject">genetics</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Doubtful Sound</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070308.144342</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The composition and interactions of catalytic surfaces in working environments</field><field name="creator">Warren, David Stephen</field><field name="description">In order to clarify the role that water plays in the photocatalytic process, changes in the IR and Raman spectra of P25 TiO&#8322; thin films were observed upon exposure to liquid water. Further investigation of these spectral changes via dehydration of thin films under nitrogen and oxygen of different humidities led to the observation of spectroscopic features that have been assigned to localised surface phonon modes. When the effect of UV irradiation on these features was investigated, a broad IR absorption due to transitions of electrons in shallow traps was detected under dry nitrogen but not under dry oxygen. 
 Further investigation of the photocatalytic properties of P25 TiO&#8322; showed a complete removal of a stearic acid film. The final products have been tentatively assigned to a mixture of short chain carbonyl species and adsorbed carbonates as well as carbon dioxide and water. 
 The IR spectrum of the fuel cell membrane material Nafion is complex and literature data varies in some of the assignments. The compound perfluoro(2-ethoxyethane)sulfonic acid was used as a model compound for the Nafion side chain resulting in a clearer assignment of the Nafion IR spectrum. In light of these new assignments changes induced in the region 1100-1300 cm&#8315;&#65533; by variation in humidity and ion exchange have been shown to be mainly the result of changes in the sulfonate asymmetric stretching modes. 
 By flowing a series of solutions containing tetramethylammonium ions and perchlorate ions the surface charge characteristics of a Pt black film were determined in the pH range 2-12. There proved to be a weak positive charge below pH 4 and a weak negative charge above pH 9. Between these points there appeared to be no overall charge on the surface. 
 When perfluoro(2-ethoxyethane)sulfonic acid was adsorbed to a Pt black film changes in its IR spectrum indicated a strong binding via interactions between the sulfonate groups and the Pt surface. The nature of the adsorption of Nafion was less clear cut and, whilst adsorption is strong, it seems possible that hydrophobic interactions between the Nafion backbone and the surface are involved.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">catalysis</field><field name="subject">metallic oxides</field><field name="subject">adsorption</field><field name="subject">surface chemistry</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070312.133709</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation into the antimicrobial repertoire of Streptococcus uberis</field><field name="creator">Wirawan, Ruth E.</field><field name="description">Streptococcus uberis, an environmental organism also associated with dairy animals, is a common and persistent cause of bovine mastitis. New approaches to control these infections need to be identified. One such strategy may be the application of bacteriocins; proteinaceous antimicrobials elaborated by bacteria that typically inhibit the growth of strains closely related to the producer organism. The well-characterized lactococcal bacteriocin nisin is the active ingredient in two commercial products currently in use for the prevention of mastitis. However, reports of resistance development have prompted the investigation of alternative bacteriocins to be used in conjunction with nisin in 'bacteriocin cocktails' designed to have more comprehensive inhibitory activity against mastitis pathogens. The bacteriocins of gram-positive bacteria have been divided into four distinct classes: (I) lantibiotics, (II) non-lantibiotic peptides, (III) large proteins, and (IV) circular peptides. 
 Although it has been known for more than twenty years that S. uberis commonly produce bacteriocin-like inhibitory substances (BLIS), none had been characterised prior to the present study. The first step in the current investigation was a survey of the BLIS activities of a set of fifteen S. uberis and S. bovis strains against a set of standard indicators as well as common gram-positive mastitis pathogens. Additional tests using a deferred antagonism agar plate-based assay showed that some of the BLIS activities were heat-sensitive and their production was influenced by the presence of either blood or a fermentable carbohydrate source in the test medium. On the basis of the results obtained from these tests it became apparent that S. uberis and S. bovis may commonly produce more than a single inhibitory agent. 
 S. uberis 42 became the focus of this study because (a) it had broad inhibitory activity against mastitis-associated bacteria, (b) it did not display cross-resistance to nisin, and (c) from the preliminary screening results it appeared to produce both heat-stable and heat-labile inhibitory agents. Acid extracts of S. uberis 42 cells yielded inhibitory activity that, when fractionated by reversed-phase HPLC, yielded a peptide of 3029 Da. Although this peptide was blocked to Edman degradation at position 2, following propanethiol-modification a 20-amino acid sequence was obtained. Degenerate primers to lantibiotic biosynthesis gene homologs were used to initiate inverse PCR and primer walking, ultimately yielding a 15-kb contiguous sequence encompassing 11 genes typical of those involved in lantibiotic synthesis, regulation and immunity. Due to the close similarities to nisin of the S. uberis 42 lantibiotic precursor (78%), and the organisation and composition of the locus, this inhibitor was named nisin U. Nucleotide sequences homologous to insertion sequences were detected in the vicinity of the nisin U locus, and indicate a possible mechanism of acquisition of this locus by S. uberis. The locus was detected in ten other S. uberis, and also in two S. agalactiae and two S. thoraltensis strains, and in one S. porcinus and one S. pluranimalium strain. The amino acid sequences of some of these differed in one or two amino acids, and these variants were named nisin U2 and nisin U3 accordingly. Nisin U, the two nisin U variants, and nisin A exhibited cross-immunity (i.e. all of the producer strains were insensitive to each form of nisin) and cross-inducibility (i.e. all of the producer strains displayed enhanced production when exposed to each form of nisin). 
 Nisin U did not contribute to the entire spectrum of inhibitory activity of S. uberis 42. Freeze thaw extracts of S. uberis 42 agar cultures yielded heat-labile inhibitory activity that was inhibitory to L. lactis A5, a producer of nisin Z. Subsequent purification by cation-exchange chromatography, gel filtration, and reversed-phase HPLC yielded a peptide of mass 7048 Da, which was resistant to Edman degradation. Digestion with chymotrypsin released an 819 Da peptide fragment of sequence NH&#8322;-KAQAVIW-COOH. Tn916 mutagenesis of S. uberis 42 enabled the identification of the genetic locus of the inhibitor, comprising six genes potentially involved in its biosynthesis and immunity. The detection of a pair of flanking 159-bp direct repeats indicates possible acquisition of the locus by 'long target duplication'. The inhibitor was inferred to be a circular peptide, on the basis of its behaviour to Edman degradation, and by comparison of its locus with that of other circular bacteriocins. On the basis that the purified peptide appears to induce lysis in sensitive bacteria, although by an as-yet unidentified mechanism, the inhibitor was named uberolysin. The uberolysin structural gene was detected in eight other strains of S. uberis, however not all of these appeared to be producing active inhibitor. 
 No bacteriocins closely resembling the two reported in this thesis have been demonstrated previously to be produced by members of the genus Streptococcus. The remarkable diversity in the structures, activity spectra and basic modes of action of these two bacteriocins produced by a single strain of S. uberis, combined with the observation of apparent greater heterogeneity in properties of a preliminary sampling of BLIS-producing strains, indicates that these bacteria may be an important source of novel antimicrobials of potential value for the treatment of mixed bacterial infections and for minimising potential resistance development.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Streptococcus uberis</field><field name="subject">bacteriocins</field><field name="subject">mastitis</field><field name="subject">dairy cattle</field><field name="subject">diseases</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070312.142108</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Research of mixture of experts model for time series prediction</field><field name="creator">Wang, Xin</field><field name="description">For the prediction of chaotic time series, a dichotomy has arisen between local approaches and global approaches. Local approaches hold the reputation of simplicity and feasibility, but they generally do not produce a compact description of the underlying system and are computationally intensive. Global approaches have the advantage of requiring less computation and are able to yield a global representation of the studied time series. However, due to the complexity of the time series process, it is often not easy to construct a global model to perform the prediction precisely. In addition to these approaches, a combination of the global and local techniques, called mixture of experts (ME), is also possible, where a smaller number of models work cooperatively to implement the prediction. 
 This thesis reports on research about ME models for chaotic time series prediction. Based on a review of the techniques in time series prediction, a HMM-based ME model called "Time-line" Hidden Markov Experts (THME) is developed, where the trajectory of the time series is divided into some regimes in the state space and regression models called local experts are applied to learn the mapping on the regimes separately. The dynamics for the expert combination is a HMM, however, the transition probabilities are designed to be time-varying and conditional on the "real time" information of the time series. For the learning of the "time-line" HMM, a modified Baum-Welch algorithm is developed and the convergence of the algorithm is proved. 
 Different versions of the model, based on MLP, RBF and SVM experts, are constructed and applied to a number of chaotic time series on both one-step-ahead and multi-step-ahead predictions. Experiments show that in general THME achieves better generalization performance than the corresponding single models in one-step-ahead prediction and comparable to some published benchmarks in multi-step-ahead prediction. Various properties of THME, such as the feature selection for trajectory dividing, the clustering techniques for regime extraction, the "time-line" HMM for expert combination and the performance of the model when it has different number of experts, are investigated. 
 A number of interesting future directions for this work are suggested, which include the feature selection for regime extraction, the model selection for transition probability modelling, the extension to distribution prediction and the application on other time series.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">time-series analysis</field><field name="subject">Markov processes</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070312.144924</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Population dynamics, spawning and movement of brown trout in Taieri River tributary streams</field><field name="creator">Kristensen, Esben Astrup</field><field name="description">The aim of this study was to investigate population densities and dynamics of brown trout along multiple tributaries of the Taieri River, a large New Zealand river. Relationships between juvenile brown trout population dynamics and food availability, discharge and water temperature were examined in the same lowland stream. Downstream movements of juvenile brown trout were also examined. Trace element analyses of eggs aimed to identify the source of fish spawning in tributary streams. An experimental study of juvenile brown trout collected from downstream and upstream reaches compared patterns of agonistic behaviour amongst trout that were considered to be dominated by either migratory (downstream) or resident (upstream) fish. Longitudinal surveys of juvenile trout abundance were expanded across four additional streams to determine whether there were consistent patterns in population dynamics of brown trout. 
 Large spatial and temporal variation in population dynamics of juvenile brown trout was found in Silverstream with an upstream site having significantly less temporal variation in densities than a downstream site. No effect of food availability on population dynamics was found. Discharge and temperature affected population densities of juvenile brown trout in some years, but could not solely explain the general pattern in spatial variation in population dynamics. Downstream movement was found to be a behavioural strategy used by juvenile brown trout and appeared to contribute to variation in juvenile density. 
 Analysis of trace element signatures in brown trout eggs indicated that upstream spawning migration by anadromous females was restricted by the presence of a steep gorge along the middle reaches of the Taieri River. Patterns of spawning by migratory and resident fish along tributary streams appeared to vary. In Silverstream, spawning by anadromous fish dominated the lower reaches, whereas considerable overlap between anadromous and resident fish was observed in Big Stream. In Cap Burn distinct trace element signatures were observed for redds spawned along upstream and downstream reaches. However, it was not possible to confidently ascribe the source of the redds to main river migrants or Cap Burn resident fish. 
 Behavioural observations of juvenile brown trout collected from upstream (resident) and downstream (migratory) reaches of Silverstream revealed differences in aggression level, with migratory fish being more aggressive. No difference in growth rates was found between fish from the two areas. Furthermore, the social organisation of resident fish was based on the formation of dominance hierarchies, whereas the competitive status of migratory fish was more even. 
 Patterns in spatial and temporal variation in the longitudinal population dynamics and patterns of abundance of juvenile trout were repeated across the five tributaries. Populations in upstream reaches consisted of fish from multiple age classes and exhibited relatively limited variation in densities, whereas juvenile fish dominated populations along downstream reaches and densities varied greatly over an annual cycle. 
 Taken together, these results suggest a general pattern of spatial and temporal variation in the population dynamics of brown trout sub-populations along tributaries of a large New Zealand river. Whilst various environmental factors may contribute to some of the variation, longitudinal separation into resident and migratory populations also appeared to be important. These finding are important for the management of brown trout in both main river channels and tributaries in New Zealand.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Brown trout</field><field name="subject">fish populations</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Taieri River</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070314.091924</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Osmoregulatory physiology of salmon intestine : developmental and endocrine regulation</field><field name="creator">Veillette, Philip A.</field><field name="description">The parr-smolt transformation is a life-history strategy that has evolved in salmon to prepare migratory juveniles for oceanic survival. A necessary adjustment for homeostasis is an increase in the uptake of fluid by the intestine, which will continuously replace the loss of body water in a salty environment. Vertebrate corticosteroids regulate hydromineral balance. Cortisol mediates adaptive changes in fish intestine, but much remains to be learned about the sites of action and participation of other endocrine signals. 
 To begin, I asked whether the numerous extensions of the salmonid intestine, pyloric caeca, are osmoregulatory sites? Fluid uptake rate and Na&#8314;, K&#8314;-ATPase activity (ion pump that drives solute and water transport) were measured on isolated caeca of chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) after 9-10 days or 6 months residence in seawater, following transfer from fresh water. Na&#8314;, K&#8314;- ATPase and fluid uptake were concurrently elevated after seawater adaptation. Short-term cortisol implants in the peritoneal cavity of freshwater salmon increased circulating cortisol to high physiological concentrations and caused similar elevations in Na&#8314;, K&#8314;-ATPase activity and fluid uptake. 
 Tissue culture of intestine from freshwater-adapted sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerkca) was used to assess potential direct effects of cortisol. Cortisol exposure maintained Na&#8314;, K&#8314;-ATPase activity above that of control explants and, in some cases, similar to levels before culture. A response was specific for the corticoid cortisol, elicited within 2 days, and dose-dependent over a physiological range. 
 Next, seasonal changes in endogenous Na&#8314;, K&#8314;-ATPase activity and tissue responsiveness to cortisol were determined for chinook salmon maintained in fresh water. There were pronounced increases in endogenous enzyme activity in summer for both intestinal regions, in underyearlings and yearlings. In pyloric caeca, a significant positive response of Na&#8314;, K&#8314;-ATPase activity to cortisol, in vitro, was restricted to the months preceding increases in endogenous Na&#8314;, K&#8314;-ATPase and the month afterward. 
 Several experiments were conducted in which chinook salmon were implanted with ovine growth hormone (5 (mu)g/g body weight), cortisol (50 (mu)g/g body weight), or both. Cortisol implants significantly elevated plasma cortisol concentrations and stimulated Na&#8314;, K&#8314;-ATPase activity in either caeca or posterior intestine, or both, after 7 and 14 days. Although growth hormone increased plasma cortisol concentrations after 14 days, no interaction occurred between cortisol and growth hormone on Na&#8314;, K&#8314;-ATPase activity. 
 The effect of insulin-like growth factor I on Na&#8314;, K&#8314;-ATPase activity was examined in tissue-cultured intestine of chinook salmon. Prior to culture, salmon were implanted with or without ovine growth hormone (5 (mu)g/g body weight) for 7 days. Intestinal explants were then exposed to recombinant human insulin-like growth factor I (rhIGF-I) for 3 or 6 days in culture. In caeca, rhIGF-I (0.01-1.0 (mu)g/ml) significantly maintained Na&#8314;, K&#8314;-ATPase activity above controls (0 (mu)g rhIGF-I /ml) in a dose-dependent manner, regardless of whether the fish were pretreated with growth hormone in vivo. The posterior intestine was not responsive to rhIGF-I. 
 These results demonstrate pyloric caeca are a major osmoregulatory site, evidenced by tissue responsiveness to cortisol (and IGF-I) and stimulation of functional changes indicative of parr-smolt transformation.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">salmon</field><field name="subject">physiology</field><field name="subject">osmoregulation</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070315.163047</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Computing automorphisms of finite groups</field><field name="creator">Bidwell, Jonni</field><field name="description">In this thesis we explore the problem of computing automorphisms of finite groups, eventually focusing on some group product constructions. Roughly speaking, the automorphism group of a group gives the nature of its internal symmetry. In general, determination of the automorphism group requires significant computational effort and it is advantageous to find situations in which this may be reduced. 
 The two main results give descriptions of the automorphism groups of finite direct products and split metacyclic p-groups. Given a direct product G = H x K where H and K have no common direct factor, we give the order and structure of Aut G in terms of Aut H, Aut K and the central homomorphism groups Hom (H, Z(K)) and Hom (K, Z(H)). A similar result is given for the the split metacyclic p-group, in the case where p is odd. Implementations of both of these results are given as functions for the computational algebra system GAP, which we use extensively throughout. 
 An account of the literature and relevant standard results on automorphisms is given. In particular we mention one of the more esoteric constructions, the automorphism tower. This is defined as the series obtained by repeatedly taking the automorphism group of some starting group G&#8320;. There is interest as to whether or not this series terminates, in the sense that some group is reached that is isomorphic to its group of automorphisms. Besides a famous result of Wielandt in 1939, there has not been much further insight gained here. We make use of the technology to construct several examples, demonstrating their complex and varied behaviour. 
 For the main results we introduce a 2 x 2 matrix description for the relevant automorphism groups, where the entries come from the homorphism groups mentioned previously. In the case of the direct product, this is later generalised to an n x n matrix (when we consider groups with any number of direct factors) and the common direct factor restriction is relaxed to the component groups not having a common abelian direct factor. In the case of the split metacyclic p-group, our matrices have entries that are not all homomorphisms, but are similar. We include the code for our GAP impementation of these results, which we show significantly expedites computation of the automorphism groups. 
 We show that this matrix language can be used to describe automorphisms of any semidirect product and certain central products too, although these general cases are much more complicated. Specifically, multiplication is no longer defined in such a natural way as is seen in the previous cases and the matrix entries are mappings much less well-behaved than homomorphisms. We conclude with some suggestion of types of semidirect products for which our approach may yield a convenient description of the automorphisms.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">finite groups</field><field name="subject">automorphisms</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070320.162909</field></doc><doc><field name="title">In vivo electrophysiology of striatal spiny projection neurons in the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR)</field><field name="creator">Pitcher, Toni Leigh</field><field name="description">The aim of this thesis was to investigate neuronal cellular mechanisms that may underlie the behavioural characteristics of the spontaneously hypertensive rat strain (SHR). The SHR was developed by selective breeding for elevated blood pressure and is also described as having increased levels of locomotor behaviour compared to its normotensive control strain, the Wistar-Kyoto. This hyperactivity and other behaviours, including altered sensitivity to reinforcement, have been used to model aspects of behaviour displayed in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. In vivo intracellular recording of striatal spiny projection neuron activity in urethaneanaesthetised animals from three genetically related strains: the SHR, Wistar-Kyoto and standard Wistar, was employed to measure basic cellular properties and cellular mechanisms of reward-related learning. This population of neurons was chosen because alterations in their activity can influence behaviour and they are known to show cellular changes (synaptic plasticity) that are associated with learning. 
 Cellular properties were measured in 71 neurons. Comparison between strains revealed a significant difference in action potential amplitude and duration between the SHR and Wistar-Kyoto strains. Interestingly, when measured at a later time, in a different sample of rats, the SUR action potential amplitude and duration were significantly different from the earlier sample. A change in the membrane potential repolarisation rate following action potential firing also occurred over this time. Twenty-nine of these neurons were also used in a study investigating the neuronal responses to a low dose of amphetamine (0.5 mg/kg). Changes were observed in some cellular properties following intraperitoneal administration of amphetamine. 
 Synaptic plasticity at the corticostriatal synapses is sensitive to the timing of dopamine release in relation to cortical input. In anaesthetised preparations the spiny projection neuron membrane potential fluctuates between hyperpolarised (DOWN) and depolarised (UP) states, which reflect the level of cortical input. During the present study the responses of nine neurons to the induction of cortical spreading depression were observed to investigate the suitability of this method for use during synaptic plasticity experiments. Spiny projection neurons showed unpredictable responses to cortical spreading depression, therefore this method was not used further. Corticostriatal synaptic plasticity was induced in sixteen spiny projection neurons from two strains: SHR and Wistar. High frequency stimulation of the dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra, during the DOWN-state, did not induce any significant changes in corticostriatal synaptic efficacy. This was also true when high frequency stimulation of dopamine neurons was applied during the UP-state in neurons from the SHR strain. 
 This thesis represents the first in vivo intracellular study of neuronal physiology in the SHR and Wistar-Kyoto rat strains. Results revealed action potential differences between these two behaviourally distinct rat strains. Synaptic mechanisms thought to underlie reward-related learning were not different between the SHR and Wistar strains, although the observed levels of plasticity were inconsistent with previous literature.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">electrophysiology</field><field name="subject">neurons</field><field name="subject">rats</field><field name="subject">physiology</field><field name="subject">hypertension</field><field name="subject">animal models</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070321.114819</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Myogenic mononucleated cell populations in the developing vertebrate limb in vivo</field><field name="creator">Lee, Antonio Seung Jin</field><field name="description">Skeletal muscles of the limb are derived from somites and their precursors migrate to the limb prior to muscle formation. Upon migration, a limited number of stem cells multiply and differentiate to give rise to fusion-competent muscle cells, which fuse to form the multinucleated myotubes. During the course of myogenesis there is thus a period of few days when cells at different developmental stages such as migrating, proliferating, differentiating and fully differentiated co-reside within the developing limb bud. Current understanding on how these cells interact and behave during early and later myogenesis in vivo is lacking. The aim of this project was to identify and further classify the mononucleated myogenic cells present within the developing limb muscle and examine their behaviours at different stages of myogenesis. 
 The lack of an appropriate method to extract and visualise cellular constituents of developing muscles has been a major limitation hindering such investigations in vivo. In this project, we first developed a unique cell isolation method to extract mononucleated cells from developing muscles, allowing examination of mononucleated cells in vivo using immunocytochemistry. As Pax3, Pax7 and Myogenic Regulatory Factors (MRFs) are the key players for the muscle formation, they were used to mark the different myogenic sub-populations. 
 The results from chicken and rats clearly demonstrate that three myogenic cell pools, namely Pax3, Pax7 and MRFs positive cells, and 4 sub-populations formed by their overlap, co-exist in specific proportions within the developing limb muscle, and that their proportions undergo dynamic changes during the course of myogenesis. The most striking observation was that the sizes of Pax3 and MRF compartments remain constant while that of Pax7 compartment increases dramatically during myogenesis. Thus each myogenic cell compartment in the developing muscle has different cell kinetics during primary and secondary myogenesis. The dynamic changes in the proportions of these myogenic sub-populations may constitute a dynamically maintained cellular niche, within which the muscle stem cells reside. Our study suggests that the concept of community effect - the interaction between a group of cells and their surrounding cells, originally from invertebrate muscle system, may be conserved in mammalian systems. Furthermore, this study for the first time, reports that the earliest fully differentiate muscle cells in the rat hindlimb are highly elongated mononucleated cells which express Pax3, MyoD, myogenin and myosin but not Myf-5 protein. 
 In summary, this study provides quantitative data to demonstrate dynamic changes in various mononucleated myogenic cell populations during skeletal muscle formation and reveals that Pax7(+ve) population becomes significantly upregulated during secondary myogenesis.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">myoblasts</field><field name="subject">vertebrates</field><field name="subject">extremities (anatomy)</field><field name="subject">growth</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070321.143922</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Double-TOP trap for ultracold atoms</field><field name="creator">Thomas, Nicholas</field><field name="description">The Double-TOP trap is a new type of magnetic trap for neutral atoms, and is suitable for Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) and evaporatively cooled atoms. It combines features from two other magnetic traps, the Time-averaged Orbiting Potential (TOP) and Ioffe-Pritchard traps, so that a potential barrier can be raised in an otherwise parabolic potential. The cigar-like cloud of atoms (in the single-well configuration) is divided halfway along its length when the barrier is lifted. 
 A theoretical model of the trap is presented. The double-well is characterised by the barrier height and well separation, which are weakly coupled. The accessible parameter space is found by considering experimental limits such as noise, yielding well separations from 230 [mu]m up to several millimetres, and barrier heights from 65 pK to 28 [mu]K (where the energies are scaled by Boltzmann&#65533;s constant). Potential experiments for Bose-Einstein condensates in this trap are considered. 
 A Double-TOP trap has been constructed using the 3-coil style of Ioffe-Pritchard trap. Details of the design, construction and current control for these coils are given. Experiments on splitting thermal clouds were carried out, which revealed a tilt in the potential. Two independent BECs were simultaneously created by applying evaporative cooling to a divided thermal cloud. 
 The Double-TOP trap is used to form a linear collider, allowing direct imaging of the interference between the s and d partial waves. By jumping from a double to single-well trap configuration, two ultra-cold clouds are launched towards a collision at the trap bottom. The available collision energies are centred on a d-wave shape resonance so that interference between the s and d partial waves is pronounced. Absorption imaging allows complete scattering information to be collected, and the images show a striking change in the angular distribution of atoms post-collision. The results are compared to a theoretical model, verifying that the technique is a useful new way to study cold collisions.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bose-Einstein condensation</field><field name="subject">magnetic traps</field><field name="subject">nuclear optical potentials</field><field name="subject">laser cooling</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070321.160859</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Stepping stones to others&#65533; minds : the relation between maternal mental and non-mental state input and social understanding in 15-,24, and 33 month-old children</field><field name="creator">Taumoepeau, Mele Ma'ata</field><field name="description">Recent research has shown that children under two years demonstrate some early social understanding. Previous research has also demonstrated that mother talk about mental states is a factor in older preschoolers&#65533; later theory of mind understanding. In order to learn more about the predictive nature of mother mental state talk to very young children, this study examined the relation between mother talk about mental states at 15 and 24 months and their later mental state language and emotion understanding at 24 and 33 months. 
 At all three time points, 71 mothers and 3 fathers (N=74) described pictures to their infants and mother talk was coded for mental and non-mental state language at 15, 24 and 33 months. In addition, at all three time points, children&#65533;s mental and non-mental state vocabulary levels were obtained via parental report. At the second and third time points the children were administered an emotion situation and a body emotion task. The mothers&#65533; ability to interpret emotion faces was also assessed. 
 The results showed that mother use of desire language was more prevalent at 15 months, with references to thinking and knowledge increasing at 24 months. 
 Partial correlations demonstrated that mother use of desire language with 15-month old children uniquely predicted a child&#65533;s mental state language and emotion situation task performance at 24 months, even after accounting for earlier child language, mother socioeconomic status, mothers&#65533; own emotion understanding, and other types of mother non-mental state language. Similarly, at 24 months of age, after accounting for potentially confounding variables, such as child language, mother use of think/know language as well as desire language were both predictors of children&#65533;s mental state language and emotion task performance at 33 months. 
 The results further demonstrated that mothers&#65533; tendency to refer to the child&#65533;s (versus others&#65533;) desires at 15 months was the more consistent correlate of children&#65533;s mental state language and emotion understanding at 24 months. At 24 months a different pattern emerged with both references to the child&#65533;s and others&#65533; thoughts and knowledge correlating with child mental state language and emotion task performance at 33 months. 
 It is proposed that Vygotsky&#65533;s zone of proximal development provides a framework within which maternal talk about specific mental states scaffolds the development of children&#65533;s later social understanding. I also suggest that such scaffolding motivates mothers to talk more about the child&#65533;s mental states when they are younger, before introducing talk that focuses on others&#65533; mental states.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">social perception in children</field><field name="subject">social interaction in children</field><field name="subject">social skills in children</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070322.121926</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effects of aging on remembering intentions : the virtual street task</field><field name="creator">Farrimond, Samantha</field><field name="description">In everyday life memory is commonly used in the completion of future intentions, such as remembering to attend a meeting or remembering to make a purchase at a particular time or place. The ability to remember to complete future intentions plays an important role in older adults maintaining independent living within the community (Cherry &amp; LeCompte, 1999). The studies presented in this thesis evolved out of the lack of current understanding about which component processes involved in remembering future intentions are most susceptible to the effects of aging. In order to investigate these processes, a computer-based analogue of a real-life task was developed (the Virtual Street) that enabled participants to complete a series of intentions (shopping errands) during a simulated visit to a shopping centre. 
 There were two main objectives of this thesis. The first objective was to examine whether the Virtual Street shopping task was appropriate for assessing older and younger adults ability to remember to complete delayed intentions and whether the task had better ecological and face validity than current assessment measures. The second objective was to identify the cognitive processes involved in the task that were vulnerable to the effects of aging, and whether the process of recognising the cues or the memory search of the intention content would be affected. In order to examine these cognitive processes, various factors were manipulated in ways designed to be analogous to real-world situations, which were hypothesized to be sensitive to the effects of aging. These factors include: a change in the location where an intention can be realised (Study 1), the opportunity to learn the intentions (Study 2), the familiarity of the shopping environment (Study 3), and the presence of distractions (Study 4). 
 Overall, the results from the four studies demonstrated that older adults have difficulty remembering delayed intentions, even when the test uses naturalistic stimuli, the tasks are familiar, and they are able to move at their own pace. Furthermore, the results from Study 2 demonstrated that the memory search component but not cue detection was affected in older persons when they were given fewer trials to learn the shopping errands, possibly due to the accessibility of the cue-intention associations may be impaired in older adults. There was no age specific effect on cue detection or memory search in either an unfamiliar street environment (Study 3) or one with increased levels of irrelevant auditory and visual noise (distraction condition, Study 4). In the interruption condition of Study 4, however, cue detection but not memory search was disproportionately affected in older adults after filled interruptions, suggesting that the capacity for self-initiated reinstatement of working memory is reduced in old age. 
 In general, the Virtual Street task was to be a practical means of examining younger and older adults ability to remember to complete delayed intentions. The Virtual Street task also provided an opportunity for behavioural observation of real-life skills and cognitive abilities, within a controlled context. It is hoped that the Virtual Street shopping task will continue to be developed into an ecologically valid measure of assessing older adults memory functioning.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">memory in old age</field><field name="subject">aging</field><field name="subject">physiological aspects</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070322.142811</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Lagarosiphon major : an introduced macrophyte and its ecological role in the littoral of Lake Dunstan, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Bickel, Tobias O.</field><field name="description">The littoral of Lake Dunstan, Central Otago, New Zealand, is dominated by the introduced submersed macrophyte Lagarosiphon major (hereafter Lagarosiphon) which effectively excludes native macrophytes from most of the littoral. Lake Dunstan is a large hydro lake that was - after reaching its operational water level in 1993 - rapidly colonized by Lagarosiphon from upstream sources. Because of its extensive biomass and growth, it is believed the macrophyte plays an important part in the lake ecosystem but also that it requires frequent management to allow for recreational activities, to restore aesthetic values of beaches and especially to prevent further spread into unaffected waterways. To assess the integration of Lagarosiphon into the lake ecosystem and possible impacts of extensive macrophyte removal a 3 year study was initiated focusing on invertebrate and fish distribution and diet in relation to Lagarosiphon. A stable isotope analysis was used to reconstruct carbon flows and trophic structure within the littoral of Lake Dunstan. Additionally, a small scale weed management experiment was carried out to assess possible impacts of macrophyte removal on invertebrates and fish. 
 Lagarosiphon harboured a high density and diversity of macroinvertebrates. The invertebrate community was dominated by mollusc species in terms of biomass and abundance. There was little temporal and spatial variation in invertebrate distribution and communities on a large scale (lake-wide variation), but there were differences in invertebrate biomass on a smaller scale in relation to the location of samples within the macrophyte belt. Invertebrate biomass was lowest at the bottom of the dense macrophyte beds. 
 The positive association of common bully (Gobiomorphus cotidianus: Eleotridae) with the dense Lagarosiphon stands and a diet - mainly consisting of invertebrates common on Lagarosiphon - suggested the important role of this macrophyte as a provider of food and shelter for small fish species. Brown and rainbow trout (Salmo trutta, Oncorhynchus mykiss: Salmonidae) diet was dominated by invertebrate species common on this macrophyte as well. 
 Results of the stable isotope analysis suggested a secondary role of Lagarosiphon in the lake food web as a surface provider for the growth of epiphytic algae that appeared to be a major primary producer in the littoral of Lake Dunstan. Detritus (FPOM), assumed to consist partly of decaying Lagarosiphon, played a less important role as a base for the food chain. The main carbon flow pathway was from the primary producers (epiphyton - FPOM) through primary consumers (Mollusca, Chironomidae, Trichoptera) through to the top predators (tertiary consumers: trout and bullies) in the system. 
 A small scale experiment on the influence of macrophyte harvest, i.e. the cutting of channels into dense macrophyte beds, showed that a partial removal of macrophyte biomass could help achieve several management goals: it not only reduced macrophyte biomass to enable recreational activities but also had no negative impacts on invertebrate biomass and diversity. The channels even increased invertebrate abundance and biomass in the treated compared to the untreated control plots along the cut edges. Regrowth of Lagarosiphon was rapid, with the cut channels being completely overgrown within 4 months. 
 All these results taken together suggested a major role of Lagarosiphon in the littoral of Lake Dunstan. Lagarosiphon supported a species rich invertebrate community and was the main provider of food and shelter for fish in this lake. A partial removal of macrophyte biomass might be a more suitable management option than large scale eradication to avoid negative impacts on the lake ecosystem. The most important aspect in management of this weed remains the prevention of further spread into pristine waters.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Lagarosiphon major</field><field name="subject">control</field><field name="subject">lake ecology</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Otago</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070323.131753</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A biomarker survey of the fatty acid status of New Zealanders</field><field name="creator">Crowe, Francesca Lee</field><field name="description">My thesis research has examined the fatty acid composition of serum triacylglycerol, phospholipid and cholesterol ester in 2793 participants who took part in the 1997 National Nutrition Survey - a national population-based survey of New Zealand adolescents and adults aged or [greater than or equal to]&#818;15 y. Differences in serum fatty acids by sex, age, ethnicity, body mass index and smoking - independent of dietary fat intake - were determined. Serum fatty acids were used as biomarkers of saturated and polyunsaturated fat intake to predict population serum total cholesterol concentrations. The association between n-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids in serum phospholipid and mental and physical wellbeing, as assessed by the short form-36, was determined. 
 Serum fatty acids have been used as biological markers of fat intake and to predict the risk of disease. The fatty acid composition of serum triacylglycerol, phospholipid and cholesterol ester is subject to alteration by dietary fat but overall, is largely controlled by metabolic enzymes. Non-dietary variables - sex, age, body mass index or cigarette smoking - may influence the activity of these enzymes, which will subsequently alter the fatty acid composition but the extent to which these affect serum fatty acid composition in the general population is poorly understood. Our results showed that the proportion of docosahexaenoic acid in serum phospholipid and cholesterol ester was significantly greater in women by 0.15 and 0.02 mol%, respectively in comparison to men whereas, the proportion of eicosapentaenoic acid was significantly greater in men by 0.08 and 0.1 mol%, respectively, after adjusting for age, ethnicity, body mass index and smoking. A number of differences in the proportion of palmitoleic acid in serum triacylglycerol, phospholipid and cholesterol ester were detected; palmitoleic acid increased across the age categories in women (15-24, 25-44, 45-64 65+ y), was higher in women compared to men, New Zealand Europeans compared to New Zealand Maori and Pacific People, those with a body mass index or [greater than or equal to] 30 kg/m&#65533; compared to those with a body mass index &lt; 25 kg/m&#65533; and in current smokers in comparison to non-smokers. In women, there was an inverse trend in the proportion of linoleic acid in serum phospholipid and cholesterol ester across the age categories. The proportion of linoleic acid in serum triacylglycerol, phospholipid and cholesterol ester was lower in smokers by 2.19, 1.04 and 0.75 mol%, respectively in comparison to non-smokers. None of these differences could be explained by a difference in dietary fat intake. Consequently, sex appears to affect the metabolism of n-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids independent of dietary fat intake and metabolic differences associated with age, body mass index and smoking may be at play for a number of other serum fatty acids notably, palmitoleic and linoleic acids. 
 Evidence for a role of dietary fat as a predictor of serum cholesterol concentrations in the general population is conflicting. On one hand, results from cholesterol-lowering dietary intervention trials show unequivocally that decreasing saturated fat intake produces a meaningful reduction in serum cholesterol concentrations. On the other hand, the results of large observational studies show little association between saturated fat intake and cholesterol concentrations. The lack of association in the latter studies may result from errors in dietary assessment and therefore, using serum fatty acids as biomarkers of fat intake may overcome the limitations associated with typical dietary assessment techniques. Participants were divided into quintiles of increasing proportion of serum fatty acids. Each one SD increase in the myristic acid composition of serum cholesterol ester, triacylglycerol and phospholipid was associated with an increase in cholesterol of 0.19, 0.10 and 0.13 mmol/L, respectively after adjusting for confounding variables. The difference in cholesterol concentrations between those categorised into the highest and lowest quintiles of serum cholesterol ester myristate was 0.48 mmol/L. A one SD increase in the linoleic acid composition of serum cholesterol ester, triacylglycerol and phospholipid corresponded to a decrease in cholesterol of 0.07, 0.05 and 0.07 mmol/L, respectively. The difference in cholesterol concentrations between the 1st and 5th quintiles of serum cholesterol linoleate was 0.18 mmol/L. Intake of saturated and polyunsaturated fats, as measured using serum fatty acids, are important determinants of cholesterol concentrations in New Zealanders. 
 It has been hypothesised that a lower intake of n-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, largely of marine origin, is implicated in the aetiology of depressive disorder. Results from the majority of observational studies have shown that depressed participants have a lower proportion of eicosapentaenoic or docosahexaenoic acid in phospholipids compared to controls but evidence for an improvement in depressive symptoms after supplementation with n-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids is conflicting. There is little known about the role that n-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids may have as predictors of mental wellbeing in the general population. Participants were categorised into quintiles of increasing n-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids in serum phospholipid. There was no significant trend in self-reported mental wellbeing - the mental component score - across the quintiles of eicosapentaenoic, docosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids or the sum of these three fatty acids after adjusting for confounding variables. There was a significant trend in the mental component score across the quintiles of the ratio of eicosapentaenoic/arachidonic acid; the difference between the highest and the lowest quintile was 6.6 points. There were significant positive trends in self-reported physical health - the physical component score - across the quintiles of eicosapentaenoic and docosapentaenoic acids as well as the ratio of eicosapentaenoic/arachidonic acid ratio; the difference between the 1st and 5th quintiles were 8.6, 6.0 and 8.9 points, respectively. Overall, there appears to be little association between the n-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid composition of serum phospholipid and self-reported mental health in a population of low fish consumers; however, the proportion of n-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids may be an important predictor of physical wellbeing in New Zealanders.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">biochemical markers</field><field name="subject">lipids in human nutrition</field><field name="subject">fatty acids in human nutrition</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070328.162638</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Movements, population dynamics and predatory behaviour of stoats inhabiting alpine grasslands in Fiordland</field><field name="creator">Smith, Derek</field><field name="description">Stoats are introduced mammalian carnivores implicated in the decline of several of New Zealand&#65533;s endemic species. Most research into stoats in New Zealand has focused on beech forest habitat, especially in years of peak stoat abundance following heavy beech seedfall and peak cohorts of mice. In New Zealand, alpine grasslands occur above the altitudinal limit of beech forest (900-1000 m a.s.l.). Although previous research has shown stoats to be present there, little is known about the ecology of stoats in alpine grasslands. This research aimed to test whether alpine grasslands were a marginal habitat occupied by surplus stoats that had spilled over from beech forest populations, i.e. a sink habitat. The alternative is that alpine grasslands are a desirable habitat deliberately exploited by stoats. This question was answered using mark-recapture, radio-tracking, diet analysis and a food addition experiment. Another objective was to determine whether nest survival is higher in alpine grassland compared to beech forest and whether stoats are likely to be a frequent predator of ground nests in alpine grasslands relative to other introduced mammals that inhabit them. If nest survival is higher in alpine grassland then alpine grasslands may be a refuge from predation. However, if it is not then it is important for management to know the relative risk posed by stoats compared with other predators. An artificial nest experiment was used to answer these questions. This research was undertaken during two years of low to intermediate beech seedfall and therefore provided an opportunity to look at the ecology of stoats in a New Zealand National Park outside years of peak abundance. The principal study site for this research was the Borland Valley, Fiordland National Park. 
 Compositional analysis showed that stoats in alpine grassland selected for it over adjacent beech forest. The range cores of these stoats were high up in alpine grassland away from the ecotone with beech forest. Stoats occurred at similar densities in alpine grasslands as they did in beech forest and observed survival was similar between the two habitats (with the exception of 2004 when it may have been higher in alpine grassland). The most frequent prey of stoats inhabiting beech forest were birds and mice. Although stoats in alpine grasslands also ate birds and mice their most frequent prey were ground weta and hare. Food addition appeared to cause diet switching but did not reduce the distances moved by stoats, suggesting that other factors may be more important in regulating their summer home range size in alpine grasslands. All of these factors lead to the conclusion that alpine grasslands in the Borland are not a marginal habitat for stoats, but may instead be a desirable one. Artificial nests had a higher probability of survival in alpine grassland compared to adjacent beech forest, but survival was too low to support the idea that alpine grasslands are a refuge. Stoats were the most frequent predator of artificial nests in both habitats, but 95 % confidence intervals overlapped the predation rate by possums, which was also high. 
 These findings illustrate the need for a comprehensive landscape approach to stoat control in montane National Parks, for two reasons: 1) endemic biodiversity in alpine grasslands may be under threat from stoat predation, 2) alpine grasslands may act as a source for dispersing stoats that reinvade lowland stoat control areas. In the absence of heavy beech seedfall and peak mouse abundance, stoats occurred at densities of around 1 km&#8315;&#65533; in both habitats and there was recruitment into these populations. This raises the important question: What regulates the distribution and abundance of stoats in years of low beech seedfall and low mouse abundance? In these years birds, ground weta and hares may be as important as mice are in years of peak abundance following heavy beech seedfall.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ermine</field><field name="subject">habitat</field><field name="subject">monitoring</field><field name="subject">predatory animals</field><field name="subject">grassland ecology</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fiordland National Park</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070330.160940</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Searching and ranking structured documents</field><field name="creator">Trotman, Andrew</field><field name="description">It is common to see documents with explicit structure marked up in languages such as XML. Queries, on the other hand, typically have no structure. There is a clear mismatch, although documents contain structure it is typically not used in information retrieval. 
 An efficient index structure for document-centric searching is proposed and its efficiency is discussed. It is shown to be at worst linear with respect to the number of occurrences of a given search term. The algorithm is then extended to accommodate element-centric information retrieval. 
 Ranking algorithms for structured documents are examined. Genetic Algorithms are used to learn different weights for each structure present in a document. Applying these weights as part of a function is shown to yield significant precision improvements in some functions. Genetic Programming is then used to learn an entire ranking function. This function is shown to be portable between document collections. 
 A query language for structured information retrieval is proposed. Use of this language in the 2004 INEX workshop resulted in a large decrease in query errors. 
 Structured information retrieval is now a viable alternative to its unstructured counterpart.

K.</field><field name="description">Ageing is a complex phenomenon, characterised by progressive loss of function, decreasing resistance to age-associated pathologies and stress, and increasing rates of mortality. The Free Radical Theory of Ageing implicates reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS/RNS) generation as being integral to the ageing process, subjecting the organism to oxidative stress. Oxidative damage to biomolecules is suggested to be causative in the formation of ageing-associated phenotypes, dysregulation and dysfunction. 
 Mitochondria are responsible for the production of the majority of ROS/RNS through normal functioning of the respiratory chain. Previous studies have reported increasing mitochondrial dysfunction with age, including oxidative damage to protein, lipid and DNA. Thus, mitochondrial dysfunction is considered by many to be central to the Free Radical Theory of Ageing. However, there are conflicting data on changes in mitochondrial and cellular function and damage on ageing. 
 To investigate the role of mitochondrial protein oxidative damage in ageing, the heart, brain and liver of young (~ 2 month-old) and old (24 month-old) Wistar rats were fractionated into homogenate, cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions. Mitochondrial function was evaluated by measuring activity of the oxidative phosphorylation Complexes I-V, and correlating activity with quantitation of Complex subunits. The activities of the electron transport chain Complexes (I-IV) were largely unchanged on ageing, and no significant differences were seen in the protein levels of nuclear-encoded Complex I-IV subunits. There was a ~ 40% decrease in ATP synthase activity in heart and liver mitochondria from old rats as compared to young, but no change in the level of the Complex V nuclear-encoded subunit. These results suggest the decreased activity is due to modification of Complex V in heart and liver mitochondria on ageing, rather than changes in expression. 
 Oxidative stress is a common cause of mitochondrial dysfunction, and is often accompanied by an increase in cellular antioxidant defences. Expression of the mitochondrial antioxidant enzyme, MnSOD, was found to be increased in the liver (+ 74%) and heart (+ 82%), but not brain, in old rats, suggesting oxidative stress in these organs on ageing in rats. 
 To investigate generalised protein oxidative damage accumulation on ageing, whole tissue homogenate, cytosol and mitochondria were isolated from young and old heart, brain and liver. These fractions were assayed for three markers of protein oxidative damage: protein carbonyl content (a marker for generalised oxidative damage occurring via attack by many ROS/RNS), and ortho-tyrosine and meta-tyrosine accumulation (two markers specific for hydroxyl radical attack on phenylalanine). 
 There were no consistent age-related changes in these biomarkers in any tissues, and no consistent significant differences between cytosolic and mitochondrial protein oxidative damage for any of the three tissues in the two age cohorts. Mitochondria were further subfractionated into membrane-enriched and matrix-enriched subfractions, but again, protein oxidative damage markers were largely unchanged on ageing. 
 These results suggest that there is no common pattern of mitochondrial dysfunction during ageing in rats. Increased mitochondrial oxidative stress is a feature of ageing, but generalised protein oxidative damage is neither necessary nor sufficient for development of the ageing phenotype.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">oxidative stress</field><field name="subject">mitochondria</field><field name="subject">metabolism</field><field name="subject">aging</field><field name="subject">molecular aspects</field><field name="subject">rats</field><field name="subject">physiology</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070403.111245</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Oranga niho : a review of Maori oral health service provision utilising a kaupapa maori methodology</field><field name="creator">Broughton, John</field><field name="description">The goal of this study was to review Maori oral health services utilising a kaupapa Maori framework. 
 The aims of the study were to identify the issues in the development, implementation and operation of Maori dental health services within each of the three types of Maori health providers (mainstream, iwi-based, partnership). The three Maori oral health services are: (i) Te Whare Kaitiaki, University of Otago Dental School, Dunedin. (ii) Te atiawa Dental Service, New Plymouth. (iii) Tipu Ora Dental Service, in partnership with the School Dental Service, Lakeland Health, Rotorua. 
 Method: A literature review of kaupapa Maori research was undertaken to provide the Maori framework under which this study was conducted. The kaupapa Maori methodology utilised the following criteria: (i) Rangatiratanga: The assertion of Maori leadership; (ii) Whakakotahitanga: A holistic approach incorporating Te Whare Tapa Wha; (iii) Whakapapa: The origins and development of oranga niho; (iv) Whakawhanuitanga: Recognising and catering for the diverse needs of Maori; (iv) Whanaungatanga: Culturally appropriate forms of relationship management; (v) Maramatanga: Raising Maori awareness, health promotion and education; and (vi) Whakapakiri: Recognising the need to the build capacity of Maori health providers. 
 Ethical approval was granted by the Otago, Bay of Plenty and Taranaki Ethics Committees to undertake interviews and focus groups with Maori oral health providers in Dunedin, Rotorua and New Plymouth. Information was also sought from advisors and policy analysts within the Ministry of Health. A valuable source of information was hui korero (speeches and/or discussion at Maori conferences). An extensive literature was undertaken including an historical search of material from private archives and the now defunct Maori Health Commission. 
 Results: An appropriate kaupapa Maori methodology was developed which provided a Maori framework to collate, describe, organise and present the information on Maori oral health. 
 In te ao tawhito (the pre-European world of the Maori) there was very little if any dental decay. In te ao hou (the contemporary world of the Maori) Maori do not enjoy the same oral health status as non-Maori across all age groups. The reasons for this health disparity are multifactorial but include the social determinants of health, life style factors and the under-utilisation of health services. In order to address the disparities in Maori oral health, Maori providers have been very eager to establish kaupapa Maori oral health services. The barriers to the development, implementation, and operation of a kaupapa Maori oral health service are many and varied and include access to funding, and racism. Maori health providers have overcome the barriers through two strategies: firstly, the establishment of relationships within both the health sector and the Maori community; and secondly, through their passion and commitment to oranga niho mo te iwi Maori (oral health for all Maori). The outcome of this review will contribute to Maori health gain through the recognition of appropriate models and strategies which can be utilised for the future advancement of Maori oral health services, and hence to an improvement in Maori oral health status. 
 Conclusion: This review of Maori oral health services has found that there are oral health disparities between Maori and non-Maori New Zealanders. In an effort to overcome these disparities Maori have sought to provide kaupapa Maori oral health services. Whilst there is a diversity in the provision of Maori oral health services, kaupapa Maori services have been developed that are appropriate, effective, accessible and affordable. They must have the opportunity to flourish.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori (New Zealand people)</field><field name="subject">health and hygiene</field><field name="subject">dental care</field><field name="subject">dental health education</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070404.165406</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Requirements for splicing by Cne PRP8, a novel intein from cryptococcus neoformans</field><field name="creator">Pearl, Esther</field><field name="description">Inteins are autocatalytic protein domains that splice out of the nascent polypeptide shortly after translation, requiring no co-factors to facilitate splicing. There is an intein coding sequence within the Prp8 gene of Cryptococcus neoformans, a human pathogen that causes cryptococcosis in immunocompromised people. The intein, Cne PRP8, is a drug target as Prp8 is a central component of the spliceosome and thus believed to be essential to the fungus. Improved knowledge of the intein and its requirements for splicing can contribute to design of a screening system and the search for an inhibitor of intein splicing. 
 Purification of Cne PRP8 for crystallisation was performed using either an N- or a C-terminal His&#65533;Tag&#65533;, where the N-terminal His&#65533;Tag&#65533; was removed by 3C protease prior to crystallisation trials. C-terminally His&#65533;Tagged&#65533; Cne PRP8 formed the largest crystals. The crystals were triangular plates with stepped faces. A 2.8 A&#778; data set was collected with an R[merge] of 0.151 and a mosaicity of 2.1&#65533;. A smaller crystal gave a 3.6 A&#778; data set with an R[merge] of 0.085 and a mosaicity of 1.5&#65533;. Molecular replacement was not sufficient to solve the structure, likely because the data were weak and the molecules in the asymmetric unit too numerous. Purified Cne PRP8 was additionally shown by circular dichroism to lack regular secondary structure, suggesting that regions of Cne PRP8 could be natively unstructured. 
 Cne PRP8 was expressed as a fusion protein between Haemophilus influenzae trigger factor (HiTF) and a chitin binding domain (CBD). Antibodies to the different parts of the fusion protein facilitated the observation of splicing ability by western blotting. From this it was determined that Cne PRP8 is capable of splicing in a foreign protein context. Context is important, with maximum splicing occurring when Cne PRP8 has two native N-terminal extein residues and one native C-terminal extein residue. The first residue and the last two residues of Cne PRP8 are essential for splicing; additionally the conserved threonine (T62) and histidine (H65) were shown to be catalytically important. Also required for splicing are arginine 154, tyrosine 162, and aspartate 166. Leucine 161 undergoes ~50% splicing when mutated to alanine, and tryptophan 151 undergoes limited C-terminal cleavage, but no splicing, when mutated to alanine. Tryptophan 151 was identified as a potentially crucial residue, which may function to prevent C-terminal cleavage before the N-terminal rearrangements have taken place. Overall it appears that Cne PRP8 residues that are more diverged from the general intein consensus are less essential for splicing. 
 Wild type Cne PRP8 is insensitive to zinc inhibition in vivo. It is also unresponsive to cadmium, calcium, cobalt, lithium, magnesium, manganese and nickel. However, a partially splicing-deficient mutant exhibited further inhibition in response to zinc and cadmium. This mutant also showed a limited increase in splicing efficiency in response to temperatures lower than 37&#65533;C. 
 This study has identified critical residues, in addition to those at the splice junctions necessary for catalysis, which participate in splicing intermediates.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cryptococcus neoformans</field><field name="subject">genetic engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070405.145703</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The use of the cytokines IFN&#947;, IL-12 and IL-23 to modulate immune responses raised by the gene gun method of DNA vaccination</field><field name="creator">Williman, Jonathan A.</field><field name="description">Since its discovery 15 years ago there has been an explosion of research in the field of DNA immunisation. Unfortunately despite early promises that DNA immunisation had the potential to cure almost any infectious disease, autoimmune disease or even cancer, progress towards clinical trials has been slow. This has been due in part to the huge range of permutations possible in delivering the DNA. One approach is to deliver the DNA by gene gun. Gene gun delivery is a very efficient way of transfecting cells however also has a number of possible disadvantages. These drawbacks include a weak immunogenicity in larger animals as well as the tendency to bias towards the development of a strong type 2 response. 
 In an effort to enhance antigen-specific immune responses and counter the type 2 polarisation of gene gun delivery, a series of DNA vaccines were created where the extracellular portion of the hemagglutinin (HA) gene from influenza A/PR8/34 virus was genetically fused the type 1 cytokines IFN&#947;, IL-12 and IL-23. Interleukin-23 has been recently discovered and even though both IL-12 and IL-23 contain the p40 subunit they seem to have dissimilar functions. 
 The vaccine constructs were first tested in cellular assays in vitro to ensure correct production and biological activity of the attached cytokines. They were then delivered in various combinations to groups of BALB/c mice to test development of immune responses and the effect of different delivery regimes. Finally mice were immunised then challenged with live influenza virus to determine the different DNA vaccines&#65533; protective efficacy. 
 DNA vaccines containing the HA gene alone (pHA) or fused to IFN&#947; (pIFN&#947;HA), IL-12 (pIL-12HA) or IL-23 (pIL-23HA) were successfully constructed. The fusion of the HA gene to the genes for IFN&#947;, IL-12 or IL-23 did not significantly disturb the structure of the antigen or prevent the biological actions of the cytokines. Mice immunised three times with pHA had high titres of serum IgG1 antibody and their splenocytes produced approximately equal amounts of IFN&#947; and IL-5. Co-delivery of IFN&#947; was unable to alter immune responses regardless of whether it was delivered at the first, last or during all immunisations. Surprisingly co-delivery of IL-12 acted to suppress both antibody and cellular immune responses, possibly through an IFN&#947;/nitric oxide feedback loop. On the other hand co-delivery of IL-23 tended to enhanced immune responses and, while it did not significantly alter the type 1 to type 2 balance, it was able to increase the ability of mice to clear live influenza virus from their lungs when they were challenged 26 weeks after immunisation. This protection was associated with increased levels of neutralising antibody in the serum of pIL-23HA immunised mice. 
 This research has illuminated several of the pitfalls in the development of DNA vaccines and the use of cytokine as adjuvants. However it has also broadened our understanding of IL-23 and implies that IL-23 could be effectively used to increase the development of longterm immunity after immunisation.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">DNA</field><field name="subject">immunology</field><field name="subject">immune response</field><field name="subject">DNA vaccines</field><field name="subject">drug delivery systems</field><field name="subject">cytokines</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070405.151123</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Addressing complexity in product design : guidelines for product designers</field><field name="creator">Gollner, Mark</field><field name="description">Modern product design projects are often challenged by their interdisciplinary nature, increasing product complexity and time pressure. The challenge for product designers is to recall all relevant design aspects that are potentially applicable and important for the product to be designed at the right time. The negligence of certain design aspects may result in increased development costs and in inferior products. A recommended way to handle complexity in the design process is to work systematically, with checklists and guidelines offering a possibility to support product designers in this task. However, design guidelines that provide a comprehensive and generically content that support product designers holistically in their design projects are not readily available. Moreover, in-depth evaluations of the role, use, usefulness and usability of design guidelines are quite rare in the current literature. 
 Therefore, the research study presented in this thesis sought to accomplish two tasks: the generation of a comprehensive set of generic and practically aimed product design guidelines in a paper-copy format that holistically supports product designers in their often complex design projects; and the evaluation of these generated design guidelines with the purpose of determining their role, use, usefulness and usability for product designers. 
 A comprehensive and generically applicable set of product design guidelines in a ready-to-use paper-copy format that holistically provides in-depth information for the product design aspects that need to be considered during a design process was generated. Besides, a research study, using questionnaires and interviews, with product design students and professional product designers in New Zealand was carried out with the purpose of determining the role, use, usefulness and usability of the generated design guidelines for designers. As a consequence, valuable insights into the role of the guidelines as practitioners&#65533; design tool for professional designers and noteworthy findings about the role of the guidelines as educational tool for novice designers were obtained. 
 The findings suggested that the use of guidelines as a tool in the design process is generally not very prevalent due to the designers&#65533; lack of knowledge about the benefits, location and accessibility of useful product design guidelines. Furthermore, it has been found that the designers used the generated guidelines sporadically and driven by their interest or demand in the design aspects applicable to their projects. In terms of the guidelines&#65533; usefulness it has been identified that the guidelines evaluated were generically applicable to different projects and provided a specific in-depth content. The guidelines have also been found to be quite useful as educational, planning, management and evaluation tool for novice and professional designers. 
 However, in terms of the guidelines&#65533; usability, several problems were determined that made the generated guidelines too inefficient to be beneficial for the participants, especially for the professional designers. Accordingly, it has been concluded that a change of the guidelines&#65533; format into a digital interactive format, is likely to solve most of the identified problems and provide a useful and usable tool for product designers respectively.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">design methodology</field><field name="subject">design research</field><field name="subject">product management</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070405.154020</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Isotropic medium chain mono- and diglyceride systems : vehicles for subcutaneous injection in sheep</field><field name="creator">Sari, Peyami</field><field name="description">Purpose: To develop an approach to formulating an injectable solution containing both hydrophilic and lipophilic drugs for subcutaneous administration. Based on the literature survey, isotropic medium chain mono-and diglyceride (MCMDG) systems were chosen for study. For this purpose, analytical methods were developed and validated. In vitro assessments of the MCMDG systems, and in vitro release and in vivo studies were conducted. 
 Methods: The phase diagrams of the isotropic MCMDG systems were constructed with systems comprising two and three components. The isotropic region was examined by visual inspection and confirmed using polarized light microscopy. Viscosities of formulations were measured. The validated HPLC assay methods were developed for determination of levamisole and abamectin in liquid formulations and in sheep plasma. The HPLC assay was capable of evaluating stability of abamectin and levamisole in liquid formulations. Solubilities of levamisole hydrochloride or levamisole phosphate and abamectin were determined in the isotropic MCMDG formulations using a HPLC assay method. Stabilities of levamisole phosphate and abamectin were conducted in the isotropic MCMDG formulations at 60&#65533;C for 10 days. In vitro release studies for levamisole phosphate were carried out for selected formulations using modified Franz diffusion cells. Based on stability and in vitro release studies, one formulation (MCMDG/propylene glycol (PG):glycerol formal (GF), 20/20:60 % w/w) was selected for a preliminary in vivo study. The selected MCMDG/PG:GF (20/20:60) formulation containing both levamisole phosphate and abamectin was injected subcutaneously into sheep, and the injection site was examined after subcutaneous injection. Pharmacokinetic profiles were determined. A correlation between in vitro fraction released (FR) and in vivo fraction absorbed (FA) for levamisole phosphate from the MCMDG/PG:GF (20/20:60) formulation was assessed. 
 Results: The isotropic systems of the MCMDG systems containing two or three components were characterized through phase diagrams and viscosity. The solubility of the levamisole hydrochloride in the isotropic MCMDG/sesame oil/water formulations was higher in the absence of abamectin than in combination with abamectin. Solubility of levamisole phosphate was higher in the MCMDG system containing GF or PG compared to the MCMDG/SO/water system. The isotropic MCMDG/PG:GF systems allowed preparations of levamisole phosphate/abamectin solution dose forms containing more than the usual dosage of levamisole. Stability of both levamisole phosphate and abamectin in MCMDG/PG:GF formulations was higher compared with MCMDG/PG:GF/water formulations. Levamisole phosphate degraded in the presence or absence of abamectin in the MCMDG/PG:GF (20/20:60) formulation at 60&#65533;C for 10 days. Abamectin alone was found to be stable in the formulation at 60&#65533;C for 10 days. In vitro release of levamisole phosphate from water and the MCMDG formulations tested displayed first-order kinetics. Water from the receptor compartment was observed to pass through the membrane into the donor compartment. Therefore, an advancing layer of turbidity occurred in the donor phase. A highly significant decrease in release rate of levamisole phosphate was obtained in MCMDG/GP:GF (20/20:60) formulation compared to water and the other formulations. Pharmacokinetic studies of subcutaneous injection of MCMDG/PG:GF 20/20:60) formulation showed the tmax values of 2.2 h and 4.2 days for levamisole phosphate and abamectin, respectively. The Cmax was 0.94 [mu]g/ml for levamisole phosphate and 6.24 ng/ml for abamectin while the formulation displayed the AUC value was 5.2 [mu]g&#65533;h&#65533;ml&#8315;1 for levamisole phosphate and 84.7 ng&#65533;day&#65533;ml&#8315;1 for abamectin. No inflammatory reaction was observed at the injection site. Linear regression analysis showed that a significant relationship between the FR (in vitro) and FA for the subcutaneously injected formulation. 
 Conclusion: The study carried out in this thesis introduces a new approach to formulating an injectable solution of the isotropic MCMDG/PG:GF systems containing both levamisole (hydrophilic drug) and abamectin (lipophilic drug) for subcutaneous administration, and presents the development of the HPLC assay methods for determination of levamisole and abamectin in liquid MCMDG formulations and plasma, in order to investigate in vitro and in vivo release from the isotropic MCMDG/PG:GF formulations. The MCMDG/PG:GF formulations may represent an alternative to the more traditional formulations for both lipophilic and hydrophilic drugs.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">injections</field><field name="subject">solutions (pharmacy)</field><field name="subject">drugs administration</field><field name="subject">sheep as laboratory animals</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070405.160443</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Structural controls on gold - quartz vein mineralisation in the Otago schist, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Scott, John G.</field><field name="description">Hydrothermal fluid flow is spatially and genetically associated with deformation in the earth&#65533;s crust. In the Otago Schist, New Zealand, the circulation of hydrothermal fluids in the Cretaceous formed numerous mesothermal gold-quartz vein deposits. Otago schist rocks are largely L-S tectonites in which the penetrative fabric is the product of more than one deformation phase/transposition cycle. Regional correlation of deformation events allowed mineralised deposits to be related to the structural evolution of the Otago Schist. Compilation of a detailed tectonostratigraphy of New Zealand basement rocks reveals that extensional mineralisation correlates with the onset of localised terrestrial fanglomerate deposition, thermal perturbation and granitic intrusion that mark the beginning of New Zealand rifting from the Antarctic portion of Gondwana. 
 Laminated and breccia textures in mineralised veins suggest that host structures have experienced repeated episodes of incremental slip and hydrothermal fluid flow. However, analysis of vein orientation data in terms of fault reactivation theory (Amontons Law) shows that most deposits contain veins that are unfavourably oriented for frictional reactivation. Repeated movement on unfavourably oriented structures may involve dynamic processes of strain refraction due to competency contrasts, the effect of anisotropy in the schist, or localised stress field rotation. 
 Deposits have been classified on the basis of host structure kinematics at the time of mineralisation into low angle thrust faults, and high angle extensional fault - fracture arrays. Low angle deposits have a mapped internal geometry that is very different from conventional imbricate thrust systems. This study applied &#8308;&#8304;Ar/&#65533;&#8313;Ar geochronology to selected deposits and has identified at least three distinct mineralisation events have occurred within the central axial belt during the Cretaceous. Relationships between radiometric apparent age and inferred crustal depth reveal that after metamorphism, the onset of cooling and rapid exhumation of the schist belt coincides temporally and spatially with the age of mineralisation and structural position of a regional scale low angle shear zone in Otago.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">schists</field><field name="subject">hydrothermal deposits</field><field name="subject">quartz</field><field name="subject">gold ores</field><field name="subject">geology</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Otago</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070412.160816</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of expertise in face perception : processing configural information in own-race and other-race faces</field><field name="creator">Schuchinsky, Maria</field><field name="description">The effects of expertise, such as better recognition of own-race than other-race faces, have been attributed either to poor encoding of configural information (the dual-mode theory) or to representation of faces on dimensions attuned to own-race faces and, hence, inappropriate for coding of other-race faces (the ABC model). Neither framework alone has been able to account for the variety of past results. It is proposed that a composite account derived from the dual-mode theory and the ABC model may offer a more complete explanation of the effects of race. To evaluate the composite account, six experiments using perceptual paradigms were carried out. 
 The structure of face space and the effects of expertise on configural processing were assessed in a dissimilarity perception task (Experiment 1). Caucasian and Chinese participants judged dissimilarity of own-race and other-race faces with various configural distortions relative to their unaltered versions. As predicted by the composite account, face spaces derived from the dissimilarity ratings for own-race and other-race faces were comparable. Consistent with the premise that expertise affects configural coding, Caucasian participants exhibited greater sensitivity to configural changes of own-race than other-race faces. 
 The effects of expertise on configural encoding were further examined in a bizarreness perception paradigm (Experiments 2-4). Caucasian participants rated bizarreness of unaltered and distorted faces rotated from upright to inverted in 15&#65533; increments. The distortions involved either simple component alterations (i.e., whitened pupils and blackened teeth), global configural changes (i.e., inverted eyes and mouth), or more local configural transformations (e.g., moving the eyes closer together and upwards, and shifting the mouth down). Similar bizarreness ratings for all faces with component distortions confirmed that expertise does not affect processing of simple component information. Differences in the perceived bizarreness of own-race and other-race faces in the unaltered and global configural distortion conditions corroborated the hypothesis that expertise influences holistic configural encoding. Variations in the perceived bizarreness of faces with more local configural changes, however, indicated that expertise might also affect local configural coding. 
 The effects of expertise on local configural processing were further examined in a discrimination paradigm (Experiments 5 and 6). Participants made same-different decisions with upright and inverted face pairs comprising either two identical faces (same trials) or unaltered and distorted versions of the same face (different trials). To distinguish between holistic and local processing of configural information, partial faces were created in addition to whole faces. Higher accuracy for own-race than other-race faces at both upright and inverted orientations in both whole and partial face conditions substantiated the argument that expertise modulates local configural encoding. 
 Altogether, the present investigation offers direct evidence for the composite account of the effects of race. As ventured by the composite account, the own-race face bias in face perception was shown to be due to variations in configural processing. In addition, the reported experiments support the argument that configural information can be encoded both locally and holistically.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">face perception</field><field name="subject">cross-cultural studies</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070412.162508</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Plasma volume and the physiological response to sodium loading in men and women</field><field name="creator">Sims, Stacy Teresa</field><field name="description">The metabolic heat generated by exercise must be dissipated to maintain body temperature within narrow physiological limits; during exercise and heat exposure, body water is lost via sweating to enable evaporative cooling of the body. When sweating takes place, total body water is reduced (without the intake of additional fluids) from each fluid compartment due to the free exchange of water between compartments with a concomitant loss of electrolytes, primarily sodium. A series of three investigations were undertaken to evaluate: 1) the efficacy of acute sodium citrate-chloride loading on endurance trained males and females as a viable means to expand extracellular fluid volume, 2) any menstrual cycle effects on renal handling of this sodium load at rest, and 3) if any subsequent hypervolaemia reduces the physiological strain of exercise in warm conditions in both genders. The first investigation examined eight endurance-trained (VO&#8322;[max]: 58 ml&#65533;kg&#8315;&#65533;&#65533;min&#8315;&#65533; (SD 5); 36 y (SD 11)) runners in a randomized double-blind crossover study. The participants ingested a high-sodium (HighNa&#8314;: 164 mmol Na&#8314;&#65533;L&#8315;&#65533;) or low-sodium (LowNa&#8314;: 10 mmol Na&#8314;&#65533;L&#8315;&#65533;) beverage (10 ml&#65533;kg&#8315;&#65533;) before running to exhaustion at 70% VO&#8322;[max] in warm conditions (32&#65533;C, 50% RH, V[a]~1.5 m&#65533;s&#8315;&#65533;). Results indicate that HighNa&#8314; increased PV before exercise (4.5% (SD 3.7)), calculated from Hct and [Hb]), whereas LowNa&#8314; didn&#65533;t (0.0% (SD 0.5); P = 0.04), and involved greater time to exercise termination in those who were stopped due to ethical end point of 39.5&#65533;C and volitional exhaustion (39.5&#65533;C: 57.9 min (SD 6) vs. 46.4 min (SD 4); n = 5, P = 0.04; EXH: 96.1 min (SD 22) vs. 75.3 min (SD 21); n = 3, P = 0.03; HighNa&#8314; vs. LowNa&#8314; respectively). At equivalent times before exercise termination, HighNa&#8314; also involved lower core temperature (38.9 vs. 39.3&#65533;C; P = 0.00) and perceived exertion (P = 0.01), and a tendency for lower heart rate (164 vs. 174 bpm; P = 0.08). 
 The main purpose of the second investigation was to investigate the efficacy of an acute sodium load on endurance trained women&#65533;s plasma volume and renal mechanisms across the menstrual cycle at rest. This was evaluated by inducing a sodium-mediated plasma volume expansion using HighNa&#8314; at rest during the last high hormone week of the OCP cycle (HH[ocp]) or the late-luteal phase of the natural cycle (LUT[nat]) and during the low hormone sugar pill week of the OCP cycle (SUG[ocp]) or during the early follicular phase of the natural cycle (FOL[nat]. Thirteen women completed the study with one woman on a progestin-only pill (results were used for case study, not statistical analyses) and were assigned to one of two groups: 1) control (NAT, n = 6, 24 y (SD 5), 53 ml&#65533;kg&#65533;ml&#8315;&#65533; (SD 3)) or oral contraceptive pill (OCP, n = 6, progestin only n = 1, 29 y (SD 6), 51 ml&#65533;kg&#65533;ml&#8315;&#65533; (SD 2)) group according to their usage status. Across the four-hour post loading time there was greater plasma volume expansion in SUG[ocp] and FOL[nat] vs. LUT[nat] and HH[ocp] (5.06% (SD1.16) vs. 3.35% (SD 0.23), P = 0.02). OCP usage did not reliably alter the hypervolaemic response (P = 0.27), and this was not dependent on phase of cycle (P = 0.32). Plasma volume expansion occurred across both types and phases of the menstrual cycle with evidence that estradiol interactions with AVP, P[osm] and body water retention are stronger in the low hormone phase of the OCP than in the follicular phase of the natural cycle; illustrated by greater overall water retention after an acute sodium+water load. 
 The third investigation was conducted during the high hormone phase of both OCP and NAT menstrual cycles to further examine sodium-loading effects on the physiological capacity of exhaustive cycling in warm conditions. Thirteen endurance-trained (VO&#8322;[peak] 52 ml&#65533;kg&#8315;&#65533;&#65533;min&#8315;&#65533; (SD 2); 26 y (SD 6), 60.8 kg (SD 5), mean (SD)) cyclists completed this double-blind, crossover experiment during the high hormone phase of the menstrual cycle. Cyclists ingested a concentrated sodium (HighNa&#8314;: 164 mmol Na&#8314;&#65533;L&#8315;&#65533;) or low-sodium (LowNa&#8314;: 10 mmol Na&#8314;&#65533;L&#8315;&#65533;) beverage (10 ml&#65533;kg&#8315;&#65533;) before cycling to exhaustion at 70% VO&#8322;[max] in warm conditions (32&#65533;C, 50% RH, V[a]~5.6 m&#65533;s&#8315;&#65533;). HighNa&#8314; increased PV before exercise, similar to that of the men in the first investigation, whereas LowNa&#8314; didn&#65533;t (4.4% (SD 1.2) vs. -1.9% (SD 1.3); P &lt; 0.0001), and involved greater time to exhaustion (98.6 min (SD 25.6) vs. 78.5 min (SD 24.6); P &lt; 0.0001). There was a higher baseline core temperature and faster rate of change for HH[ocp] for both beverage conditions (HighNa&#8314;: 37.15 (SD 0.6) vs. 36.92&#65533;C (SD 0.4); P = 0.05, LowNa&#8314;: 37.04 (SD 0.6) vs. 36.90&#65533;C (SD 0.4), P = 0.05; HH[ocp] vs. LUT[nat], respectively). Through this series of investigations a greater understanding was achieved of fluid balance and the effect of pre-exercise hypervolaemia between genders; pre-exercise ingestion of a concentrated sodium beverage increased plasma volume before exercise and involved less thermoregulatory and the actual and perceived physiological strain during exercise and increased endurance in warm conditions.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">sodium in the body</field><field name="subject">blood plasma</field><field name="subject">endurance sports</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070418.143047</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of calcium-dependent pathways in vestibular compensation</field><field name="creator">Sansom, Andrew J.</field><field name="description">Damage to one vestibular apparatus (unilateral vestibular deafferentation, UVD) results in severe postural and ocular motor disturbances (such as spontaneous nystagmus, SN) that recover over time in a process known as vestibular compensation. However, the underlying neurochemical mechanisms of vestibular compensation are poorly understood. While UVD affects many areas in the CNS, attention has focused upon the partially deafferented second order neurons in the vestibular nuclei complex (VNC). Several converging lines of evidence suggest that Ca&#65533;&#8314;-permeable ion channels (N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors and L-type voltage-gated Ca&#65533;&#8314;-channels) and intracellular Ca&#65533;&#8314;-dependent protein kinases play an important role in vestibular compensation. However, the nature of this involvement and the locus of these changes are unknown. The aim of this thesis was to investigate the role of Ca&#65533;&#8314; signalling pathways in the VNC during vestibular compensation in guinea pig. These issues were investigated in three separate experiments that utilised two methodological approaches: i) in vitro assays were used to determine the nature and extent of protein phosphorylation within the VNC at various stages of compensation; and ii) ion channel blockers or cell-permeable kinase inhibitors were injected directly into the VNC immediately before UVD to determine whether or not these systems were causally involved in compensation. 
 The results of experiment 1 (Chapter 5) showed that a bolus intra-VNC injection of an uncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonist, but not an L-type voltage-gated Ca&#65533;&#8314; channel antagonist, temporarily reduced SN frequency at the earliest measurement time (6 hours post-UVD). These results suggested that the initial expression of SN required, in part, the activation of NMDA receptors in the VNC on the side of the UVD, and by inference, Ca&#65533;&#8314; entry through the ion channel. The results of experiment 2 (Chapter 6) revealed that the medial VNC contains abundant Ca&#65533;&#8314;/calmodulin-dependent and Ca&#65533;&#8314;/phospholipid-dependent protein kinase activities. The same VNC tissue removed from animals at various times after UVD, showed that vestibular compensation is accompanied by specific changes in the phosphorylation of several major protein kinase C substrates. These included an unidentified 46-kDa band, and a 75-kDa band with similar characteristics to the myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate (MARCKS). These results suggest that protein kinase C signalling pathways may be involved in vestibular compensation. The results of experiment 3 (Chapter 7) are consistent with these results showing that intra-VNC infusion of a protein kinase C inhibitor, but not a Ca&#65533;&#8314;/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II inhibitor, significantly increased SN at the earliest measurement times (6 and 8 hours), but had no effect upon the time taken to achieve compensation or on postural compensation. These results suggest that the induction of SN compensation involves protein kinase C activity in the VNC. Taken together, these findings suggest that the mechanisms underlying the expression of SN (e.g., Ca&#65533;&#8314; influx via NMDA receptors) are possibly distinct from those that initiate its compensation (e.g., PKC activation). The downstream effects of raised intracellular Ca&#65533;&#8314; may involve protein kinase C-dependent phosphorylation of key intracellular proteins that initiate long-lasting changes in cellular function within the VNC.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">methyl aspartate</field><field name="subject">vestibular apparatus</field><field name="subject">labyrinth (ear)</field><field name="subject">calcium channels</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070418.145158</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Volcanology of the Mawson Formation at Coombs and Allan Hills, South Victoria Land, Antarctica</field><field name="creator">Ross, Pierre-Simon</field><field name="description">The Jurassic Ferrar large igneous province of Antarctica contains significant mafic volcaniclastic deposits, underlying the Kirkpatrick flood basalts. In South Victoria Land, the mafic volcaniclastics are referred to as the Mawson Formation. At Coombs Hills, the Mawson is interpreted as filling a large vent complex, which was re-examined in detail to better understand vent-forming processes. Two contrasting types of cross-cutting volcaniclastic bodies were found in the complex, both of which are interpreted to have been forcefully emplaced from below into existing, non-consolidated debris. The first type consists of country rock-rich lapilli-tuff pipes. These are interpreted as fossilized remnants of subterranean debris jets which originated when phreatomagmatic explosions occurred near the walls or floor of the vent complex, causing fragmentation of both magma and country rock. The second type of cross-cutting body consists of basalt-rich tuff-breccias and lapilli-tuffs, some of which could have been generated by explosions taking place within pre-existing basalt-bearing debris, well away from the vent walls. Other basalt-rich zones, accompanied by domains of in situ peperite and coherent basalt, are inferred to have originated by less violent processes. 
 At nearby Allan Hills, the Mawson can be divided into two informal members, m&#8321; and m&#8322;. Member m&#8321; is exposed only at central Allan Hills, consists essentially of sedimentary material from the underlying Beacon Supergroup, and is interpreted as a [less than or equal to]180 m-thick debris avalanche deposit. Most megablocks in m&#8321; were derived from the late Triassic Lashly Formation, parts of which were probably only weakly consolidated in the Jurassic. Sandstone breccias dominate volumetrically over megablocks within the deposits. This indicates pervasive and relatively uniform fragmentation of the moving mass, and probably reflects the weak and relatively homogeneous nature of the material involved. The avalanche flowed into a pre-existing topographic depression carved into the Beacon sequence, and flow indicators reveal a northeastward movement. Sparse globular basaltic megablocks suggest that Ferrar intrusions played a role in triggering the avalanche. 
 Member m&#8322;, which is exposed at both central and southern Allan Hills, consists predominantly of metre-thick basaltic volcaniclastic layers that fall into three broad categories: (1) poorly sorted, coarse lapilli-tuff and tuff-breccia; (2) block-rich layers; (3) tuff and fine lapilli-tuff. The former type is interpreted as the deposits of high-concentration pyroclastic density currents (PDCs), probably formed during the collapse of phreatomagmatic eruption plumes. Occasional block-rich layers probably were formed by both ballistic fall from local vents and pyroclastic flows, and the finer-grained layers were probably deposited by dilute PDCs. Dilute, moist turbulent currents were also likely responsible for the generation and deposition of large ([less than or equal to]4.5 cm) rim-type accretionary lapilli. The thick layers are locally underlain by or interbedded with thin tuff ring-style volcaniclastic layers, and all the layers are underlain and invaded by basalt-rich tuff-breccias and lapilli-tuffs.

Discourses of colonialism and ongoing marginalisation, not to mention resistance, have been most salient in Maori narratives, while those focused on 'cultural deficit' have been more prominent within hegemonic narratives. The goal of the current thesis was to increase understanding of the construction of being Maori in addiction' by: i) identifying key discursive resources used to constitute related subject positions; and ii) identifying the ways in which such resources were deployed to accomplish particular tasks.
A review of influential texts identified several core discourses, which located Maori within 'traditions' of collectivity, spirituality and connection with the land. However, the ongoing impact of colonisation, including contemporary alienation from 'tradition', and construction of Maori as the inferior 'other' within hegemonic narratives were prominent. Discourses of addiction have characteristically been based on biological notions of 'disease' and 'disorder', however, psychosocial discourse has become prominent more recently. The '12 Steps' of Alcoholic Anonymous, which provided the primary resource for participants with regard to 'addiction', also includes explicit discourses of spirituality.
The current thesis was implemented within a methodological framework, kaupapa Maori. In this context deconstructive discourse analysis was identied as the most appropriate means of analysing interview data gathered from 11 men attending a 'addiction treatment' programme.
The results indicated that while 'tradition' was central to narratives of 'being Maori', dicources of alienation and loss were equally salient. In terms of 'addiction', discourses of genetic inheritance were most prominent, although psychosocially constituted 'underlying issues' were also clearly located as being important. Such 'issues' were linked to both general life experiences and 'being Maori'. 'Treatment' narratives revolved around transformative narratives of 'self'. As participants disconnected themselves from 'addiction' and 'underlying issues', they reconnected with their positive ;essential self', previously compromised by 'addiction'.
Two main discourses were utilised in terms of the relationship between 'being Maori' and 'addiction'. The first, deployed in aetiological narratives, constituted an inevitable link between  'being Maori' and substance use. The second, more prominent in 'treatment' narratives, located substance use  as antithetical to 'Maori culture'.
 While both Maori and 12 Step 'traditions' were highlighted in participants' narratives, the latter tended to be privileged. 'Being Maori' was identified as important, or at least relevant, however, the opportunity to engage with integrated indigenised narratives of 'addiction' appeared to be limited by several factors. Essentialist 'tradition', for example, tended to be uncritically privileged within discourses that failed to account for contemporary 'diverse Maori realities', ignoring the complexities of relations between and within Te Ao Maori and Te Ao Pakeha. Additionally, '12 Step' discourses of 'treatment' limited construction of more broadly focused narratives of 'recovery'. Overall, the results indicated a clear need for Maori 'addiction treatments' to avoid essentialist notions of 'tradition' and support integrated narratives of 'being Maori in addication', which reflect the varied needs, capacity and experiences of individuals and whanau.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">substance abuse</field><field name="subject">alcohol use</field><field name="subject">drug abuse counselling</field><field name="subject">Hauora</field><field name="subject">treatment</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070430.100135</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Poia mai taku poi: Unearthing the knowledge of the past : a critical review of written literature on the poi in New Zealand and the Pacific</field><field name="creator">Paringatai, Karyn Ailsa</field><field name="description">The primary objective of this thesis is to review literature written about poi in order to construct an historical overview of poi from pre-contact Maori society until the 1920s.

Their researcher was a sole Maori representative on a South Island Board of Trustees and explored the minority position of his role. The research was restricted to one Primary School and one board of Trustees. This research examined the strengths, weaknesses, attitudes and perceptions of Boards of Trustees governance when dealing with issues around their Maori communities. The role of the researcher as both writer and Board of Trustees Member, created ethical issues around objectivity and subjectivity, and sought to show how a researcher is able to remain impartial, in their own study.
The research found that relationships between mainstream Boards of Trustees and their Maori communities are better developed by including local iwi or hapu, therefore making a three way relationship.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">matauranga</field><field name="subject">education</field><field name="subject">school boards</field><field name="subject">public relations</field><field name="subject">community and school</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070430.112609</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ko taku rau kotahi</field><field name="creator">Mahuta, Dean P.

For the people of Waikato, raupatu has had such a significant impact that it has become a part of the people's identity. The New Zealand Land Wars of the 1860s signalled the beginning of the troubles for Waikato that would plague them for generations. Many Waikato people died for the land that had once nourished them, which was 'stolen' by the Crown and its colonial forces under the guise of 'confiscation' by way of the New Zealand Settlement Act 1863. This thesis examines raupatu in relation to the Waikato people, and the effects raupatu has had on them. This thesis also illustrates the connection between the Waikato people and whenua tupu (ancestral lands) through countless generations of people who committed their lives to the struggle to have their lands returned as proclaimed in the decree 'i haere whenua atu, me hoki whenua mai.' This decree is examined in relationship to the Deed of Settlement 1995 whereby the Crown addressed the grievances of the Waikato people and some hope was once again instilled within the people.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">whenua raupatu</field><field name="subject">Tainui</field><field name="subject">Waikato</field><field name="subject">land tenure</field><field name="subject">history</field><field name="subject">government relations</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070430.115046</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Takina ko au, Takina ko koe!

Traditional Maori performing arts is one of the key elements seen on the marae and it marked the first experiences between the Maori and European explorers. However, since the arrival of tauiwi (foreigners) the art has evolved, largely as a result of outside influences. Many of the changes that have been introduced to the art have been a product of the struggle of Maori to maintain their language and customs, despite the onslaught of cultural domination. An example of one such change is the introduction of a Western style competition, that is, a formal style of competition that includes judges, assessment criteria and/or competition rules, and prizes. This thesis will explore the evolution of traditional Maori performing arts with particular reference to how this traditional art form has been affected by the 'Western' notion of competition.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">poi</field><field name="subject">folk dancing</field><field name="subject">haka</field><field name="subject">performing arts festivals</field><field name="subject">kapa haka</field><field name="subject">mahi a rehia</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070430.123401</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Hokowhitu :  a sport-based programme to improve academic, career, and drug and alcohol awareness in adolescent Maori</field><field name="creator">Heke, Justin Ihirangi</field><field name="description">The purpose of this project was to design and evaluate a sport-based life skills intervention designed for indigenous New Zealand (Maori) youth who may be exposed to drug or alcohol abuse. An indigenous research approach known as Kaupapa Maori research was utilised. As an indigenous approach, Kaupapa Maori signifies the importance of research with Maori being initiated, determined, and validated by Maori and in particular, by those directly involved with the research initiative (Bishop, 1996; Tuhiwai-Smith, 1999). As a result of adhering to a Kaupapa Maori approach the participants determined additional areas of interest including academic self-esteem, intrinsic motivation for schoolwork and career awareness. Therefore, the initial project grew to include several other life skills areas identified by the participants. The life skills basis of the 'Hokowhitu' intervention was adapted from the Going for the Goal (GOAL) and Sports United to Promote Education and Recreation (SUPER) programmes developed by Professor Steve Danish (Danish, 1997; Danish &amp; Nellen, 1997; Danish, Meyer, Mash, Howard, Curl, Brunelle &amp; Owens, 1998). The GOAL and SUPER programmes taught life skills to adolescents including informed decision-making, health-enhancing activities (e.g., goal setting) and health-compromising activities (e.g., drug &amp; alcohol abuse). A New Zealand (NZ) version of the GOAL programme was successfully pilot-tested in 1997-1998 in NZ schools with non-Maori adolescents (Hodge &amp; Danish, 1999; Hodge, Cresswell, Sherburn, &amp; Dugdale, 1999). The evaluation of the Hokowhitu programme used both quantitative and qualitative analyses. The qualitative investigation received an enthusiastic response and supportive results for the Hokowhitu programme. Many of the research participants preferred the qualitative investigative approach because of the culturally recognised components (e.g., Te kanohi ki kanohi or face-to-face method used to ask questions). The quantitative investigation used; Mann-Whitney U, Wilcoxon, Chi Square and McNemar statistical tests (Harraway, 1995). The outcome of the overall programme evaluation showed that the Hokowhitu programme provided improvements in; (a) academic self-esteem, (b) increased intrinsic motivation for schoolwork, (c) increased career awareness, and (d) increased drug and alcohol awareness in adolescent Maori. Also, there was some statistical support for the Hokowhitu programme and evidence that life skills and Kaupapa Maori ideologies were able to be successfully integrated into a sport-based programme.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">sports</field><field name="subject">substance abuse</field><field name="subject">prevention</field><field name="subject">self-help techniques</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070430.124346</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Puao-te-Ata-tu and Maori social work methods</field><field name="creator">Hollis, Awhina</field><field name="description">This research project critically engages with Maori social workers in order to develop an understanding of their practice methods and to ascertain whether they have changed since the 1980's. This will include a particular focus on the influences of the Puao-te-Ata-tu report (1986) on Maori practice methods and the perspectives of Maori social workers within social service organisations. Kaupapa Maori research and Qualitative methods inform this research project. Eight Maori social workers are interviewed and their discourses are examined in relation to the changing cultural, political and economic enviroment in the 1980's. The findings show that Maori social work methods are underpinned by tikanga Maori and that these have not changed significantly since the 1980's. The Puao-te-Ata-tu report was also found to be highly influential to Maori social work in general, however it did not have a direct effect on the practice methods of Maori social workers. The research project concludes with recommendations from both the participants and the researcher. These recommendations lay emphasis on the importance of educational institutions and social service organisations implementing the Puao-te-Ata-tu report and tikanga as a means of improving services for Maori.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">social service and race relations</field><field name="subject">evaluation</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070430.125845</field></doc><doc><field name="title">God's governor : George Grey and racial amalgamation in New Zealand 1845-1853</field><field name="creator">Grant, Susannah</field><field name="description">The legend of Governor Grey is a major feature of nineteenth century New Zealand historiography. This thesis seeks to understand Grey as a real person. Acknowledging the past as a strange and foreign place, it argues that Grey (and previous interpretations of him) can only be understood in context. The intellectual milieu of liberal Anglicanism and Victorian structures of imperial authority are crucial to understanding Grey's policies of racial amalgamation.
Focusing on Grey's first governorship of New Zealand, 1845 - 1853, this thesis begins by exploring the imperial networks within which he operated. The members of Grey's web gathered and shared information to further a range of different agendas - scientific, humanitarian, and political. Grey's main focus was native civilisation. His ideas about race were informed by liberal Anglican theology, scientific investigation and personal experience. Grey believed in the unity and improvability of all mankind. His mission as governor was to elevate natives to a state of true equality with Europeans so that all could progress together still further up the scale of civilisation. This model formed the basis of Grey's 1840 plan for civilising native peoples, in which he proposed a range of measures to promote racial amalgamation in Australia.
Between 1845 and 1853 Grey implemented those measures in New Zealand. He used military force and British law to establish peace and enforce Crown authority. He used economic policies to encourage Maori integration in the colonial economy. He built schools and hospitals and enacted legislation to encourage the best features of British culture and limit the effects of its worst. He also augmented his power and encouraged amalgamation through personal relationships, official reports and the structures of colonial authority.
Grey was driven by complex, sometimes contradictory motives including personal gain, economic imperatives and political pressures. His policies have had ongoing, often devastating effects, on Maori and on race relations in New Zealand. This thesis brings to light the ideas and attitudes which formed them. Grey understood himself as a Christian governor ordained to civilise Maori and join them with British settlers in accordance with God's divine plan for improving humankind.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">government relations</field><field name="subject">politics and government</field><field name="subject">torangapu</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070501.133119</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Tapuwae: waka as a vehicle for community action</field><field name="creator">Eketone, Anaru D.</field><field name="description">Waka have a special place in the heart of many Maaori. The waka that brought the ancestors of the Maaori to Aotearoa and Te Waipounamu are valued symbols of identity, both culturally and metaphorically. With the effects of colonisation the use of waka as a means of transport disappeared leaving it to re-emerge in the 20th century as a symbol of the revitalisation of Maaori society. Through the construction of waka-taua, ocean going waka and the emergence of waka-ama as a sport, Maaori have endeavoured to reclaim their association to the seas and waterways of New Zealand.
This research is a case study of Tupuwae, a kaupapa Maaori injury prevention project using traditional Maaori concepts regarding waka and applying it to a contemporary context. Tapuwae have used this attachment of Maaori to different forms of waka to associate the message of not drinking and driving using purpose-built waka-ama in the southern part of Te Waipounamu.
This research identifies some of the wider outcomes that come from a kaupapa Maaori project, but, more importantly it identifies some of the processes that are important in implementing such a project by Maaori living in Otago, outside their tribal boundaries.
This research also raises questions about the theoretical underpinnings of kaupapa Maaori theory and argues that there are two threads to this approach, one from a critical theory informed approach and the other from a native theory approach.

The cultivars were Arawa, Makaweroa, Paretaniwha, Takaiapu, Takirikau, and Tapamangu.
The effectiveness of different microscopy techniques for taking measurements of the dimensions of ultimate fibres using a factorial experimental design was investigated in part A. Constant variables were geographical location, location of specimens along the leaf, season (winter), individual plant, fan, north-facing fan, and age of plant (approximately seven years), and cultivars (Paretaniwha and Tapamangu). Experimental variables were the microscopy techniques used and measurement axis.
Techniques selected use on further cultivars in part B were transverse sections of leaf specimens 4 m thick, embedded in Paraplast&#65533; and observed using LM, and non-fixed ultimate fibres observed using SEM.
In part B the dimensions of ultimate fibres from the six selected cultivars of harakeke were measured, and analysed (ANOVA and Tukey's HSD), and the transverse section shapes of fibre aggregates were observed. Transverse widths of ultimate fibres ranged from 10.15 m (Takaipu) -12.80 m (Paretaniwha). Ultimate fibre lengths ranged from 3735 m (Takirikau) - 4751 m (Makaweroa). The cultivars prizes for muka, Arawa and Makaweroa, had the longest and finest ultimate fibre bundles more uniform in transverse-sectional shape than the other cultivars studied and perhaps this explains their selection for extraction of muka. Takirikau had a high yield of ultimate fibre bundles, and perhaps this makes extraction of muka worthwhile. Paretaniwha differed from the other five cultivars studied having an average number of ultimate fibre bundles per unit width that were narrow and non-uniform in shape, and composed of short, thick, ultimate fibre cells.
The microscopic structure of muka from six selected cultivars of harakeke used traditionally for weaving varied and may explain differences perceived by weavers, and that different end uses are preferred for various cultivars.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">harakeke</field><field name="subject">phormium tenax</field><field name="subject">flax</field><field name="subject">textile chemistry</field><field name="subject">textile fabrics</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070501.135549</field></doc><doc><field name="title">He ratonga hauora Maori me nga ratonga rarau rongoa o Aotearoa e tirohanga, he tataritanga i nga mohio o tenei wa, i nga tumanako me etahi huarahi atu = Maori health providers and pharmacy services in New Zealand : a survey and analysis of current awareness, expectations and options</field><field name="creator">Clayton-Smith, Bevan</field><field name="description">This research aims to assess the existing relationship and characteristics between Maori health providers (MHPs) and pharmacy services in New Zealand and to provide future direction, pathways and strategies for collaboration, planning and improving health outcomes for Maori within the primary health care environment.
The characteristics of the relationship were identified and discussed before exploring strategies to strengthen the relationship and to improve Ma&#772;ori health outcomes. The assessment and analysis of the characteristics required an exploration of MHPs current knowledge of pharmacy services, the expectations of MHPs of pharmacy services and the current knowledge of pharmacists of MHP services and Maori health.
Themes identified that characterised the relationship were related to knowledge, health philosophies, interaction, service and capacity issues.
Knowledge issues incorporated themes of group dynamics, historical context, participant knowledge, pharmacy participant knowledge, MHP participant knowledge, solutions/ outcome knowledge, consideration of Maori.
Health philosophies related to themes of paradigms/worldviews, kaupapa Maori, capacity, culture and delivery of services, Treaty of Waitangi, knowledge of culture, communication and te reo, rongoa Maori, environmental culture, access, tino rangatiratanga.
Interaction issues discussed the themes of collaboration and communication, extent of collaboration, contact with Maori, community relationships, cost, benefits and opportunities.
The pharmacy environment, cost and health service delivery were identified as themes relating to service issues.
Capacity issues included themes of mana, direct workforce development (education, employment, promotion), indirect workforce development (education, environment, relationship building, funding), and the Maori Pharmacists Association.
This research attempted to follow kaupapa Maori qualitative research methodology, methods and the epistemology of kaupapa Maori throughout the research and design process. One to one semi-structured interviews were conducted with participants from each group. The sample size was established based on the purposeful sampling strategy of maximum variation sampling (7 MHP participants, 8 pharmacy participants.
Responses were directly related to differences in world-views and the historical context of the two health provider groups with respect to their roles in health. Variations within each group were related to knowledge, location and previous experience working with their counterparts.
Recommendations were associated with themes/issues of environment, knowledge, communication, cultural awareness, collaboration, services and the increased awareness of the roles and responsibilities with respect to each health provider group.
This dissertation also highlighted a number of key components that formed a collaborative, empowerment model of health created between organisations with different world-views, which can be adapted to a number of environments where there are different or opposing world-views within the overall same patient population.
It is anticipated that the results and outcomes from this research will help develop Maori responsive pharmacy services based on health promotion and wellness to Maori locally, regionally, nationally and have a positive impact on Maori health in collaboration with MHPs. Areas of pharmaceutical care are highlighted which may encourage projects or initiatives in collaboration with MHPs to enhance health gains for Maori, while increasing professional practice roles and scope for pharmacy.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">hauora</field><field name="subject">medical care</field><field name="subject">community pharmacy services</field><field name="subject">communication in pharmacy</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070501.142338</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Negotiating the landscape : a comparative investigation of wayfinding, mapmaking and territoriality in selected hunter-gatherer societies</field><field name="creator">Wylie, Joanna Kate</field><field name="description">As human beings we are continually interacting with the landscape, and have been doing so throughout the entire course of our evolution. This thesis specifically investigates the way in which hunter-gatherers negotiate and interact with their landscapes, focusing on three patterns of behaviour: wayfinding, mapmaking and territoriality. An examination of the relevant international literature reveals that globally, hunter-gatherer groups both past and present share a number of similarities with regard to their wayfinding and mapmaking techniques, territorial behaviour. A case study of Maori interaction with the landscape of prehistoric and protohistoric Te Wai Pounamu [the South Island] provides further support for the central argument that hunter-gatherers collectively negotiate and interact with the landscape in distinctive ways.  This is contrasted with the interaction of European explorers and travellers with the 19th century landscape of Te Wai Pounamu in Chapter 5.
It is determined that hunter-gatherers use detailed cognitive or 'mental' maps to navigate their way through a range of landscape from dense forests to barren plains. These maps often consist of sequences of place names that represent trails. These cognitive maps are most commonly developed through direct interaction with the landscape, but can also be formed vicariously through ephemeral maps drawn with the purpose of communicating geographical  knowledge. Prior to European contact, little importance seems to have been given to artefactual or 'permanent' maps within hunter-gatherer societies as the process of mapmaking was generally regarded as more significant than the actual product.
Although the literature on hunter-gatherer territoriality is complex and in some cases conflicting, it is contended that among a number of hunter-gatherer groups, including prehistoric and protohistoric Maori in Te Wai Pounamu, interaction and negotiation with the landscape was/is not restricted to exclusive territories marked by rigidly defined boundaries. Among these groups, a specific method of territoriality known as 'social boundry defence' was/is employed. This involves controlling access to the social group inhabiting an area rather than access to the area itself, as with groups utilising the territorial method of 'perimeter defence'.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">Kai Tahu</field><field name="subject">Te Wai Pounamu</field><field name="subject">South Island</field><field name="subject">landscape</field><field name="subject">hunting and gathering societies</field><field name="subject">cognitive maps</field><field name="subject">cartography</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070501.145510</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Interpreting culture: visitors' experiences of cultural landscape in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Carr, Anna M.</field><field name="description">This thesis examines visitors' awareness and experiences of cultural values for natural areas of importance to Maori. The South Island/Te Wai Pounamu contains natural landscapes with scenic and recreational values that attract large numbers of domestic and international visitors. Many of these areas have a cultural significance for members of the South Island's Ngai Tahu iwi and hapu groups. The Ngai Tahu Claims Settlement Act 1998 legally recognised the traditional relationships between the iwi and the natural world, whilst other Acts of Parliament provide direction to government agencies for encouraging iwi involvement in the management of natural resources. Measures include increased participation in the management of national parks through iwi representation on regional conservation boards, the New Zealand Conservation Authority, and the inclusion of Ngai Tahu values within subsequent national park management plans.
National park interpretation may influence visitors' awareness of cultural values for natural areas as visitors encounter information panels, displays, publications such as visitor guides or brochures, experience guided tours and/or audiovisual shows and view other interpretive medium. The researcher investigated visitors' awareness of Maori values for landscape at three South Island case study sites: Aoraki/Mount Cook National Park, Fiordland National Park, and Lake Pukaki. An understanding of the Ngai Tahu values for these areas was achieved through site visits, a literature review and informal interviews to enable comparisons of the management history of interpretation at the case study sites. Visitors' experiences at each site were explored with interviews, participant observations and a survey that provided qualitative and quantitative data. The survey was administered between January and April 2000 to 716 visitors, yielding 472 valid returns (65.9%).
A comprehensive profile of visitors' demographics, social and environmental values was developed from the survey data. Visitors were well educated with 70% having a tertiary education and the majority of visitors were employed in professional occupations. When asked about their previous experiences of other cultures, many visitors reported prior encounters with Australian Aborigine and Native Americans. Visitors considered Rotorua and the Bay of Islands as the locations most closely associated with Maori whereas the study sites were not regarded as significant to Maori, despite the presence of on-site interpretation conveying Maori values for each area. Maori culture was not an important travel motivation for most visitors to these areas and the research revealed diverse reactions from the survey respondents towards cultural interpretive material. Despite this a small percentage of visitors (14%), of domestic and international origins, had an extremely strong interest in future opportunities to experience cultural interpretation of the landscape, particularly in material that tended towards the narrative, for example mythology and legends.
It was concluded that a niche demand for Maori perspectives of natural areas could be further met with increased resources for interpretation at visitor centres. It was also proposed that such interpretation could attract a Maori audience, increasing Maori visitation to national parks. The participation of Maori and other host community members in the development and delivery of cultural landscape interpretation would provide broad perspectives and unique educational opportunities for the visiting public. At the case study areas, and throughout New Zealand, the cultural landscapes encountered by visitors had complex and diverse meanings to a wide range of peoples, depending on individual circumstances. Similarly, the diversity of visitors requires the development of interpretation which responds to visitor demand as well as management needs, the multitude of meanings for the landscape being but one of many possible themes.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">tourism</field><field name="subject">culture</field><field name="subject">South Island</field><field name="subject">Kai Tahu</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070501.150326</field></doc><doc><field name="title">E pakihi hakinga a kai : an examination of pre-contact resource management practice in Southern Te Wai Pounamu</field><field name="creator">Williams, Jim</field><field name="description">Life was difficult in Te Wai Pounamu before European contact. Food collecting had to return more calories than were expended in the efforts of acquisition. Areas where food was available were conserved as well as enhanced and were exploited seasonally in such a way as to optimise each season's take. It is suggested that the absence of kumera cultivations south of the Opihi river, prior to the introduction of the potato towards the end of the 18th Century, was clearly reflected in Maori life-style and social structure. Hapu were resource based rather than regional, and the resources of various hapu might be intermingled over a wide area or indeed, in some cases, shared (see: Anderson, 1980). The "orthodox" view (Anderson, 1980, etc.) is one of "Hunters and Gatherers" who exploit available resources. I argue that the resources were, in fact, managed with a view to sustainable and optimal harvests in the future. I shall apply Harris' (1987:75) optimal foraging theory in an endeavour to show that there are signs of the quality of life as a result of a low per capita human energy input into food production. This is principally evidenced by the foods eaten just for pleasure (kai rehia) and the time available for optional activities.
Accordingly, kai and the practices to control them differed from the often better documented food resources of more Northern parts of Te Wai Pounamu and Aotearoa. Nevertheless, the absence of horticulture in the south and the concomitant peripatetic life-style did not result in a lack of stewardship of resources. Based substantially on the analysis of a series of mahika kai lists, collected from elders early in the contact period, and details of traditional practices that have been handed down, this thesis argues that by 1780, when Captain Cook introduced European goods, southern Kai Tahu had in place effective procedures and practices for the sustainable use of renewable resources.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">Kai Tahu</field><field name="subject">Te Wai Pounamu</field><field name="subject">mahinga kai</field><field name="subject">mahika kai</field><field name="subject">conservation of natural resources</field><field name="subject">ethnozoology</field><field name="subject">ethnobotany</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070501.151631</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Consequences of drug use and benefits of methadone maintenance therapy for Maori and non-Maori injecting drug users</field><field name="creator">Sheerin, Ian G</field><field name="description">The consequences of drug use and benefits of methadone maintenance therapy (MMT) were investigated in a random sample of Maori and non- Maori injecting drug users in Christchurch, Aotearoa New Zealand. Eighty- five injecting drug users (IDUs) who had been on MMT for a mean time of 57 months were interviewed and followed up over an average 18 month period. 
 Markov models were used to model cohorts of IDUs, changes in their health states and the effects of MMT and anti-viral therapy on morbidity and mortality. The savings in life from reductions in drug overdoses were used as the main outcome measure in cost-effectiveness analysis. Cost-utility and cost-benefit analysis were also used to provide additional information on the costs and outcomes of treatment. Comparisons were made between: (a) MMT alone; (b) MMT provided with conventional combination therapy for hepatitis C virus (HCV); and (c) MMT provided with anti-viral therapy with pegylated interferon. 
 The monetary costs of drug use and benefits of MMT were similar for Maori and non-Maori. However, Markov modelling indicated that MMT is associated with greater savings in life for Maori than for non-Maori. Further, Maori IDUs identified the main personal costs of drug use as being loss of their children and loss of marriage or partners. 
 Large reductions in use of opioids and benzodiazipines were reported at interview, compared with before starting MMT. The participants also reported large reductions in crime and stabilisation of their lifestyles. Improvements in the general health of IDUs om MMT were reported. However, 89% were positive for HCV infection, which was identified as the major physical health problem affecting IDUs in New Zealand. Few IDUs had received anti-viral therapy for HCV infections, despite having stabilised on MMT. This study investigated the benefits of providing anti-viral therapy for HCV to all patients meeting treatment criteria. 
 The cost-effectiveness of MMT alone was estimated at $25,397 per life year saved (LYS) for non- Maori men and $25,035 for non-Maori women IDUs (costs and benefits discounted at 3%). The incremental effects of providing anti-viral therapy for HCV to all eligible patients were to save extra years of life, as well as to involve additional costs. The net effect was that anti-viral therapy could be provided, at a similar level of cost-effectiveness, to all patients who meet HCV treatment criteria. Cost-effectiveness could be improved if IDUs could be stabilised on MMT five years earlier at an average age of 26 instead of the current age of 31 years. The cost-effectiveness of treatment with pegylated interferon was similar to that for conventional combination therapy because there were incremental savings in life as well as increased treatment costs. 
 Costs per LYS were estimated to be lower for Maori than for non-Maori, reflecting ethnic differences in mortality. Sensitivity analysis revealed that provision of MMT with anti-viral treatment remained cost-effective under varying assumptions of mortality, disease progression and compliance with treatment. 
 the main problems that were not improved during MMT were continuing use of tobacco and cannabis, low participation in paid employment, only three participants had received specific treatment for their HCV infections. 
 Cost-benefit analysis using a conservative approach showed a ratio of the benefits to the costs of MMT of 8:1. Benefits were demonstrated in terms of large reductions in crime. Benefit to cost ratios were similar for the different policy examined, as well as for both Maori and non-Maori IDUs.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">hauora</field><field name="subject">drug use</field><field name="subject">Methadone maintenance</field><field name="subject">drug addicts</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070502.142602</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The genetics of abdominal aortic aneurysms</field><field name="creator">Rossaak, Jeremy Ian</field><field name="description">Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms (AAA) are amongst the top ten most common cause of death in those over 55 years of age. The disease is usually asymptomatic, often being diagnosed incidentally. Once diagnosed, elective repair of an AAA results in excellent long-term survival with a 3-5% operative mortality. However, up to one half of patients present with ruptured aneurysms, a complication that carries an 80% mortality in the community, and of those reaching hospital, a 50% mortality. Clearly early diagnosis and treatment results in improved survival. 
 Screening for AAA, with ultrasound, would detect aneurysms early, prior to rupture. However, debate continues over the cost effectiveness of population based screening programmes. The identification of a sub-population at a higher risk of developing AAA would increase the yield of a screening prograrmne. A number of populations have been examined, none of which have received international acceptance. 
 About 20% of patients with an AAA have a family history of an aneurysm. The disease is also considered to be a disease of Caucasians, both facts suggesting a strong genetic component to the disease. Perhaps a genetically identified sub-population at a high risk of developing an AAA would prove to be an ideal population for screening. 
 This thesis examines the incidence of aneurysms and the family histories of patients with AAA in the Otago region of New Zealand. Almost twenty percent of the population has a family history of AAA. DNA was collected from each of these patients for genetic analysis. The population was divided into familial AAA and non-familial AAA for the purpose of genetic analysis and compared to a control population. 
 AAA is believed to be a disease of Caucasians; a non-Caucasian population with a low incidence of AAA may prove to be a good control population for genetic studies. A literature review demonstrated a higher incidence of AAA in Caucasians than other ethnic groups and within Caucasians a higher incidence in patients of Northern European origin. The incidence was low in Asian communities, even in studies involving of migrant Asian populations. The New Zealand Maori are believed to have originated from South East Asia, therefore could be expected to have a low incidence of AAA and would make an ideal control population for genetic studies. A pilot study was undertaken to examine the incidence of AAA in the New Zealand Maori. The age standardised incidence of AAA proved to be at least equal in Maori to non-Maori, with a more aggressive form of the disease in Maori, manifesting with a younger age at presentation and a higher incidence of ruptured aneurysms at diagnosis. 
 It is well known that at the time of surgery, an AAA is at the end stage in its life. At this time, inflammation and matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) enzymes are prevalent within the aneurysm wall and have destroyed the wall of the aorta. One of the most important genetic pathways regulating these enzymes is the plasminogen activator inhibiter 1-Tissue plasminogen activator-plasmin pathway. 
 Genetic analysis of this pathway demonstrated an association of the 4G5G polymorphism in the promoter of the PAl-1 gene with familial AAA. In this insertion:deletion polymorphism, the 5G variant binds an activator and repressor, resulting in reduced PAI-1 expression and ultimately increased MMP activation. This allele was associated with familial aneurysms, 47% versus 62% non-familial AAA and 61% controls (p=0.024). 
 A polymorphism within the tissue plasminogen activator gene was also examined and no association was found with AAA. 
 Another way the MMPs expression could be increased is from mutations or polymorphisms in their own genetic structure. Stromelysin 3 is itself a MMP capable of destroying the aortic wall and it has a role in activating other MMPs. A 5A6A insertion:deletion polymorphism exists in the promoter of this gene. The 5A allele variant results in increased stromelysin expression and is associated with AAA 46% versus 33% in controls p=0. 0006. 
 The actions of the MMPs are themselves inhibited by the tissue inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases. The TIMP genes have been sequenced; two polymorphisms have been identified in the non-coding promoter area of the TIMP 1 gene. Further studies are necessary to examine the effect of these polymorphisms. 
 Inflammation has been implicated in aneurysm progression. One of the roles of the inflammatory cells found in an aneurysm is to deliver the MMP&#65533;s to the AAA. The HLA system is integral in controlling this inflammation and was therefore examined. 
 From this series of studies it is concluded that there is a genetic component to AAA. This thesis presents the first genetic polymorphism associated with familial AAA and explores the role of a genetic pathway in the formation of AAA.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">aortic aneurysms</field><field name="subject">abdominal aneurysm</field><field name="subject">genetic aspects</field><field name="subject">pathophysiology</field><field name="subject">molecular aspects</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070502.143818</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Te korero wai : Maori and Pakeha views on water despoliation and health</field><field name="creator">Rochford, Tim</field><field name="description">Having reviewed an example of environmental degradation (the effect of gold mining related activities on the acquatic ecosystems in Te Tai Poutini) from varying Maori and Pakeha perspectives I have developed a framework to find combine these perspectives into a working analytical tool kit. 
 The tool kit is intended to better define the problems to ensure that they take into account the widely differing views of Maori and Pakeha and is able to promote solutions that will be appropriate and safe for both Maori and Pakeha. 
 I have sought to collect and present a comprehensive analysis of both perspectives. I have focussed more heavily however on the Maori paradigms as they are less well reported in the literature on environmental health and less influence on the way we seek to protect people from the negative effects of environmental degradation. 
 This is despite the fact that as Maori are more likely to be exposed to environmental damage in that they are on average poorer and therefore have less choice about where they may live and are more likely to eat foods taken directly from the environment. 
 I will also show that the damage to the Arahura is far more than physical and will show the concern of kaumatua and their psychological anguish they have felt over the damage to this most tapu river. 
 For this reason I have chosen to present this thesis, in the form of a powhiri model. This model allows me to present different aspects of the problem from a Maori perspective including the views of kaumatua as well as recorded traditions. 
 I have then followed these sections with a response from a Pakeha perspective. This includes reviewing the different underlying world, view as well as some attempt to review the damage in Pakeha terms by reviewing the literature and undertaking some tests to establish procedures for a more comprehensive testing of the enviroment that surrounds the Arahura. 
 The thesis will conclude with a section summarising both strands of information and attempt to develop a framework for a health tool kit - he kete hauora. This kete will utilise Whare Tapa Wha as a way of placing the information in a context that can be presented in a reasonably coherent form. 
 Finally I will make a number of recommendations that I called a place mat - he whariki. These recommendations are presented in a framework from Te Tiriti o Waitangi. This reflects the primacy of the Treaty when considering the ways in which Maori are to be protected by the Crown. 
 These recommendations seek to respond to the principle barriers that are currently preventing local Maori from achieving a full sense of well being but, if implemented, these recommendations will ensure the protection of the health of all peoples of Te Tai Poutini.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">Kai Tahu</field><field name="subject">hauora</field><field name="subject">health</field><field name="subject">water</field><field name="subject">imperialism</field><field name="subject">colonisation</field><field name="subject">environmental aspects</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070502.145537</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Nga reo o nga niupepa : Maori language newspapers 1855-1863</field><field name="creator">Paterson, Lachlan</field><field name="description">By 1855, most Maori still lived in a tribal setting, with little official Pakeha interference. This would have been as they expected, exercising their tino rangatiratanga, the chiefly rights guaranteed by the Treaty of Waitangi. However, their world was changing. In an effort to gain Pakeha goods, many Maori had entered the market economy. Most had converted to Christianity. Many could read and write. Some had sold land to accommodate the increasing numbers of Pakeha settlers. These trends gratified the government. It envisaged a New Zealand society dominated by Pakeha, in which European mores would be norm, and where its sovereignty, gained through the Treaty, would be substantive rather than nominal. 
 At this time, the government pursued the policy of iwi kotahi (one people) or "amalgamation". This policy included the aim of elevating Maori socially and economically by extending to them the benefits of European civilisation. It sought too to encourage Maori to give up their "waste" lands for Pakeha settlement and for Maori to accept the rule of English law, and government authority. Ultimately the two races would become one society- a Pakeha-style society. The government used newspapers for disseminating its message to Maori, publishing the bi-lingual Maori Messenger-Te Karere Maori from January 1855 to September 1863. 
 This thesis investigates the government&#65533;s newspaper, plus other Maori language newspapers appearing within the period, printed by government agents, evangelical Pakeha, the Wesleyan Church, and the rival Maori government, the Kingitanga. The thesis not only looks at the impact of newspapers upon Maori society and politics at this time, but also how the newspapers portrayed the major social and political issues to Maori, including the first Taranaki War, the Kohimarama Conference, and the impending all-out war with the Kingitanga in Waikato. 
 Using the newspapers as its major source, this thesis seeks to show how Maori might have understood the issues, and where possible, to allow them to respond in their own voices. We are fortunate that for almost a year the Kingitanga was able to publish its own views in Te Hokioi, thus allowing the anti-government Maori voice to articulate its stand. However, Maori opinion was hardly unitary. The Pakeha-run Maori language newspapers, through reports, reported speeches, and their corresponence columns, provide another set of Maori opinions, which show a variety of opinions on political and social issues. Many histories of this period focus on the tensions and conflicts between Crown and Maori, thus marginalising pro-government Maori, the waverers, and those who merely wanted to keep trouble from their door. This thesis endeavours to illuminate the whole colonial discourse as it appeared in the Maori language newspapers, providing as wide a range of opinions as possible.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">newspapers</field><field name="subject">language</field><field name="subject">te reo Maori</field><field name="subject">history</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070502.151028</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The impact of becoming or wanting to become smokefree for Maori</field><field name="creator">Oxley, Vanessa</field><field name="description">Since the introduction of tobacco into New Zealand, smoking and smoking related illnesses have become more prevalent in the Maori population than New Zealand's general population. The aim of the present research was to investigate smoking from a Maori perspective. It was hoped this information would provide a better understanding of how Maori can become smokefree. The present research also investigated a number of possible benefits that could be obtained by Maori through becoming smokefree. These benefits were analysed through Mason Durie's Whare Tapa Wha model, a Maori holistic health model. Semi-structured in-depth interviews were conducted with four Maori people, two of whom were current smokers and two who were ex-smokers. Common themes emerged from these interviews including the social aspect of smoking for Maori and the influence of the enviroment on smoking behaviour. Suggestions were given to illustrate how the social aspect of smoking and the cycle that subsequently develops can be broken. Using the Whare Tapa Wha model and the personal accounts given, the benefits of breaking such a cycle were discussed. Lastly, the importance of nurturing smokefree environments, especially Maori environments, was outlined. The notion of being positive about becoming smokefree and the need to celebrate giving up smoking were highlighted throughout this research.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">hauora</field><field name="subject">nicotine addiction</field><field name="subject">smoking cessation</field><field name="subject">tobacco use</field><field name="subject">prevention</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070502.151701</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Kia pakari mai nga niho : oral health outcomes, self-report oral health measures and oral health service utilisation among Maori and non-Maori</field><field name="creator">Koopu, Pauline Irihaere</field><field name="description">Health is determined by the past as well as the present; the health status of indigenous peoples has been strongly influnced by the experience of colonisation and their subsequent efforts to participate as minorities in contemporary society while retaining their own ethnic and cultural identities. Colonial journays may have led to innovation and adaptation for Maori, but they have also created pain and suffering from which full recovery has yet to be felt (Durie, 2001). 
 The oral health area can be described as having considerable and unacceptable disparities between Maori and non-Maori (Broughton 1995; Thomson, Ayers and Broughton 2003). Few reports have been conducted concerning Maori and patterns of oral health service utilisation, however a lower service utilisation among Maori than non-Maori has been noted (TPK 1996; Broughton and Koopu 1996). Overall, Maori oral health is largely unknown due to a paucity of appropriate research. 
 This research aims to provide new information by describing Maori oral health outcomes over the life course, within a Kaupapa Maori Research (KMR) methodology. In general, the basic tenets presented for KMR are: (1) to prioritise Maori - from the margin to the centre; (2) to be Maori controlled - by Maori, for Maori; (3) to reject &#65533;victim-blame&#65533; theories; and (4) to be a step towards action and change in order to improve Maori oral health outcomes. 
 The aims of this research are to: 
 1. Describe the occurrence of caris at ages 5, 15, 18 and 26 and periodontal disease at age 26 years for Maori. 
 2. Describe self-reported oral health, self-reported dental aesthetics and oral health service utilisation among Maori at ages 5, 15, 18 and 26. 
 3. Compare the above oral health characteristics between Maori and non-Maori . 
 4. Investigate the determinants of any differences in oral health outcomes between Ma&#772;ori and non-Maori using a KMR methodology. 
 The investigation involves a secondary analysis of data from the Dunedin multidisciplinary Health and Development study (DMHDS). The existing data-set was statistically analysed using SPSS (SPSS Inc, Chicago, USA). Descriptive statistics were generated. The levels of statistical significance were set at P&lt; 0.05. Chi-square tests were used to compare proportions and independent sample t-tests or ANOVA were used for comparing means. 
 A summary of the Maori/non-Maori analysis shows that, for a cohort of New Zealanders followed over their life-course, the oral health features of caries prevalence, caries severity, and periodonal disease prevalence are higher among Maori compared to non-Maori. In particular, it appears that while Maori females did not always have the highest prevalence of dental caries, this group most often had a higher dmfs/DMFS for dental caries, compared to non-Maori. As adolescents and adults, self-reported results of oral health and dental appearance indicate that Maori males were more likely to report below average oral health and below average dental appearance, when compared to non-Maori. However, at age 26, non-Maori males made up the highest proportion of episodic users of oral health services. 
 This study has a number of health implications: these relate specifically to the management of dental caries, the access to oral health services, and Maori oral health and the elimination of disparities. These are multi-levelled and have implications for health services across the continuum of care from child to adult services; they also have public health implications that involve preventive measures and the broader determinants of health; and involve KMR principles than can be applied to oral health interventions and dental health research in general. 
 Dental diseases and oral health outcomes, such as dental anxiety and episodic use of services, are a common problem in a cohort of New Zealanders with results demonstrating ethnic disparities between Maori and on-Maori. As an area of dentistry that has had very little research in New Zealand, the findings of this study provide important information with which to help plan for population needs. 
 The KMR approach prioritises Maori and specifically seeks to address Maori oral health needs and the elimination of disparities in oral health outcomes. While the issues that are raised may be seen as the more difficult to address, they are also more likely to achieve oral health gains for Maori and contribute to the elimination of disparities.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">hauora</field><field name="subject">dental care</field><field name="subject">dental public health</field><field name="subject">surveys</field><field name="subject">attitudes</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070502.152634</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Traditional ecological knowledge and harvest management of Titi (Puffinus griseus) by Rakiura Maori</field><field name="creator">Kitson, Jane C</field><field name="description">Rakiura Maori continue a centuries old harvest of titi chicks (sooty shearwater, Puffinus griseus) which is governed primarily by Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK). The sustainability of titi harvesting is of high cultural, social and ecological importance. Some commentators view contemporary use of TEK as insufficient to ensure sustainability because it is no longer intact, too passive, and/or potentially inadequate to meet new ecological and technical challenges. Such assertions have been made in the absence of detailed description of TEK and associated social mechanisms. This thesis describes Rakiura Maori TEK practices and management systems that are in place and asks whether such systems are effective today, and whether they will remain effective in future. 
 Ecological, social and cultural factors are intertwined in cultural wildlife harvests so the methodology used was a combination of quantitative ecological methods and semi-directive interviews of 20 experienced harvesting elders. The research also used ecological science to evaluate potential harvest monitoring methods and to determine what sets the limits on harvest. These ecological studies focused on harvesting by four families on Putauhinu Island in 1997-1999. 
 Harvest is divided into two parts. In the first period (&#65533;nanao&#65533;) chicks are extracted from breeding burrows during daytime. In the second period (&#65533;rama&#65533;) chicks are captured at night when they have emerged from burrows. Nanao harvest rates only increased slightly with increasing chick densities and birders&#65533; harvest rates varied in their sensitivities to changing chick density. Although harvest rates can only provide a general index of population change a monitoring panel, with careful selection of participants, may be the only feasible way to assess population trend and thereby harvest sustainability or the resource&#65533;s response to changed management. 
 Rakiura Maori harvesting practice constitutes common property resource management based on birthright and a system of traditional rules. Protection of island habitat and adult birds, and temporal restricitions on harvest are considered most important. Legislation and a belief system of reciprocity and connection to ancestors and environment aid enforcement of the rules. 
 Ecological knowledge is learnt through observation, hands-on experience and storytelling. Younger Rakiura Maori now spend less time harvesting which puts pressure on the transmission of knowledge. Paradoxically, use of modern technology for harvesting aids transfer of essential skills because it is easier and faster to learn, thereby contributing to the continuance of a culturally important harvest. 
 Limits on harvest are passive, with the numbers of chicks taken determined by the time spent harvesting and processing. Processing is more limiting during the rama period. Future innovations that decrease the time to process each chick during rama could greatly increase the total number of chicks caught. Recently introduced motorised plucking machines decrease the time required to pluck each chick. However, on Putauhinu Island, use of plucking machines did not increase the number of chicks harvested, indicating social mechanisms were also limiting. Elders identified changing values between the generations, which may reduce the future strength of social limitations on harvest pressure. 
 Global climate change may reduce the predicability of traditional knowledge. Rakiura Maori have identified this risk and sought to examine ecological science as a tool to complement traditional knowledge for monitoring harvest sustainability. Climate change, declining ti&#772;ti&#772; numbers and potential changes in technology or markets all threaten the effectiveness of current social limits to harvest. Rakiura Maori have previously shown the ability to adapt and must look to add resilience to their institutions to ensure we keep the titi forever.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">Kai Tahu</field><field name="subject">Sooty shearwater</field><field name="subject">Titi</field><field name="subject">hunting</field><field name="subject">ethnozoology</field><field name="subject">sustainable development</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070502.153344</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Maori perspectives and the Waitangi Tribunal : the 1996 Taranaki report</field><field name="creator">Keenan, Lauren</field><field name="description">This thesis assesses the extent to which the 1996 Waitangi Tribunal report "Taranaki Report Kaupapa Tuatahi" allowed for and took heed of Maori forms of telling history.

Due to the nature of the Waitangi Tribunal, as well as its empowering statute, the extent to which it may incorporate the Maori history within its reports is limited, it does not incorporate other means by which Maori tell their histories.

This study sought to investigate factors that positively and negatively influenced levels of physical activity for Maori within Otepoti/Dunedin, and to discuss ideas and potential initiatives that could increase levels of physical activity and aid in the prevention of Type 2 diabetes. Eighteen Maori (9 males; 9 females) from this rohe (area) participated in a four hour focus group interview (groups of three) and were also invited to attend an evaluation hui. A Maori-centered research orientation was used throughout the research process. Individual transcripts from focus groups, debriefing discussion and content from the evaluation hui were inductively analysed to identify the main themes. The 'active' participants were physically active because of the benefits they attained for health and longevity, and to undertake task-oriented activity such as gathering kai. Barriers to physical activity (i.e., family, work), a contemporary societal shift towards inactivity, and negative personal attitudes and perceptions towards physical activity detrimentally affected levels of physical activity. Initiatives to increase levels of physical activity included community, educational and work-based initiatives. A key element of each proposed initiative was a 'by Maori for Maori' approach, with a focus on strengthening wha&#772;nau and iwi networks, a comfortable environment and social support. While education was believed to be a key component for Type 2 diabetes prevention, an avoidance barrier and fatalistic attitudes could negatively affect any attempt to prevent Type 2 diabetes and increase levels of physical activity. The results indicated that to strengthen Maori identity, increase levels of physical activity and prevent Type 2 diabetes, positive changes (taking responsibility for health), cultural changes (a shift towards a stronger identity and belief in the taonga [treasure] of being Maori), societal changes ( a more positive view of Maori, better role models and education), and social economic changes (better access to exercise facilities, healthy food and education for those in the lower deprivation indices) were needed.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">hauora</field><field name="subject">Non-insulin-dependent diabetes</field><field name="subject">diabetes prevention</field><field name="subject">physical fitness</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070504.111201</field></doc><doc><field name="title">He tanga ngutu, he Tuhoetanga te Mana Motuhake o te ta moko wahine</field><field name="creator">Higgins, Rawinia R</field><field name="description">Ta moko (Maori tattooing), especially facial moko (tattoo), has become a popular mechanism for the expression of self determination. Many Maori people are adopting this art form as part of a renaissance of Maori culture in Aotearoa/New Zealand. This declaration of Maori self-determination is also an assertion of the pride felt by the tangata whenua (people of the land) for their culture, their language and more, importantly, their identity. This thesis will illustrate how moko kauae (female chin tattooing) is a means of expressing Maori identity with specific reference to Tuhoe identity. Using an Indigenous theoretical framework this Maori Studies thesis examines the historical and contemporary political dimensions of moko kauae, the interface with the Maori worldview (inclusive of its cultural concepts), and its relationship to identity politics. This will be complimented by the personal stories of Tuhoe women who have undertaken moko kauae as well as commentaries from other Tuhoe people who express what their Tuhoetanga means to them and their lives.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">moko</field><field name="subject">tattooing</field><field name="subject">Ngai Tuhoe</field><field name="subject">ethnic identity</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070504.112028</field></doc><doc><field name="title">When two worlds meet : an examination of  the intersection between scientific views of genetic testing and the realm of popular culture</field><field name="creator">Campbell, Tania</field><field name="description">This thesis explores the variety of ways in which scientific views of genetic testing are portrayed in the realm of popular culture. As a case study, I have used the identification of the gene for hereditary stomach cancer which occurred in New Zealand in 1998, and was the result of a partnership between the affected whanau and scientists from the University of Otago. Both the empirical and theoretical findings of this project have shown how such accounts are not neutral or transparent. Rather, they are positioned to represent certain values and ideas, and this is even more evident when those affected are Maori.
However, considering textual representations of the gene and cancer has revealed the importance of taking into account the fact that these 'things' are also physical and material. I consider the implications of this and consider the ways in which the whanau health workers negotiate the fetishism apparent in biomedicine. Despite its misgivings, biomedicine has immense benefits, some of which the whanau have manipulated and appropriated for their own good, although they do so on their own terms. Despite the many complexities involved in this case study, this is a positive and hopeful story where those involved in the stomach cancer gene project have emerged with improved solutions.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">hauora</field><field name="subject">human chromosome abnormalities</field><field name="subject">stomach cancer</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070504.112700</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Are cultural impact assessments a tool for collaborative management?</field><field name="creator">Vanstone, Anita Mary</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates the participation of Maori (New Zealand&#65533;s indigenous people) in the impact assessment process. Traditionally, Maori have had limited involvement in the management of New Zealand&#65533;s environment. One possible solution to this could be through the adoption of a collaborative management framework. Unfortunately, there is limited information and research on tools that could facilitate collaborative management between iwi and applicants for resource consent (including, developers, planning consultants and local authorities). Therefore, this research attempts to fill in a gap in current literature and to investigate the potential of the cultural impact assessment as a tool for collaborative management. 
 Despite some criticisms of collaborative management, there are examples where this form of communicative planning has resulted in a very positive outcome for indigenous groups. Therefore, the specific aim of this research is to analyse the extent to which cultural impact assessments can be used as a tool to promote collaborative management between iwi and applicants. 
 In achieving the research objectives of the thesis, the theoretical background of collaborative management and impact assessment theories are explored. In addition, democracy and participation theories are also investigated. In particular, in the discussion of these theories emphasis is placed on the potential involvement of indigenous peoples. The thesis argues that the application of collaborative management via the use of cultural impact assessments may potentially increase Maori involvement in planning. 
 Analysis of collaborative management and impact assessment theories is supported by empirical research. This includes; 1) an exploration of the New Zealand setting for the two theories, 2) a content analysis of cultural impact assessments from eight different iwi authority in New Zealand, and 3) a case study analysis of two iwi organizations that have an established system for undertaking cultural impact assessments (Kai Tahu ki Otago and the Wellington Tenths Trust). 
 The research finds that cultural impact assessments are very similar to other impact assessment reports. However, they should be viewed as evolving documents, as there are some areas of the assessment process that need to be improved upon. 
 The research concludes by suggesting that cultural impact assessments do have the potential to be a tool for collaborative management between iwi and applicants. Further research and education in relation to the content, value and process of cultural impact assessments is required. It is also argued that increased resourcing, training and legislative requirements are needed to further increase Maori participation in planning.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">kaitiakitanga</field><field name="subject">natural resources</field><field name="subject">co-management</field><field name="subject">environmental management</field><field name="subject">environmental impact analysis</field><field name="subject">indigenous peoples</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070504.113743</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The ecology and ethnobotany of karaka (Corynocarpus Laevigatus)</field><field name="creator">Stowe, C. J. (Christopher James)</field><field name="description">Historically there has been considerable debate over the origin of karaka (Corynocarpus laevigatus J.R. et G. Forst.) In contrast, the extent and importance of pre-historic arboriculture in New Zealand has received little attention in the literature. This study reviews the ecology and ethnobotony of karaka and investigates its cultural and natural biogeography. 
Maori migration traditions frequently state that karaka was introduced to New Zealand. However, molecular evidence and finds of fossil seeds of the late Oligocene age show that karaka is endemic to New Zealand. Therefore, Maori traditions probably relate to the translocation and cultivation of karaka within the New Zealand region, for which there is abundant anecdotal evidence. Karaka fruits were a valuable addition to the Maori diet and were likely to have functioned as a replacement for traditional Polynesian precedents and entailed a rigorous regime of steaming and soaking to rid the kernal of its toxic elements. There is data to suggest selection for fruit size and/or nutritional value in cultivated karaka populations. 
A database of karaka distribution was compiled and populations classified as &#65533;cultural&#65533; or &#65533;unknown&#65533; on the basis of spatial association with archaeological sites. Groves classed as cultural were assumed to be cultivated or translocated by pre-historic Maori. Lack of effective seed dispersal by birds and the longevity of the trees, mean that the contemporary distribution of karaka provides a reasonable template for the extent of its prehistoric translocation and cultivation within New Zealand. 
Karaka has a distinct cultural and natural biogeography. The greatest overlap between cultural and unknown trees occurred in the northern North Island while the majority of trees in the lower North Island, and all trees in the South Island were classed as cultural. Prior to the arrival of Polynesians in New Zealand, karaka was probably restricted in distribution to the Northland/Auckland region. Its natural range was then extended by human translocation and cultivation to the lower North Island, South Island, Kermadec Islands, Chatham Islands and many other in-shore islands off New Zealand. 
 Climate variables were fitted to the distribution data and discriminant analysis used to further test the classification of karaka into cultural and unknown populations. Significant differences were found in climatic parameters between groups. Cultural karaka were found in enviroments with greater solar radiation seasonality, higher evaporative demands and greater soil moisture deficits than unknown karaka. The climate profile of karaka is biased towards the same environmental correlates of pa and pit site locations, further indicating that karaka was a cultivated tree crop. 
It is concluded that the importance and extent of karaka arboriculture, and probably that of other endemic tree species currently restricted to the northern North Island of cultural karaka is biased towards the same environmental correlates of pa and pit site locations, further indicating that karaka was a cultivated tree crop. 
The extensive translocation of karaka by Maori means that it has the potential, with the application of molecular methods, to serve as a marker for prehistoric settlement and mobility. Preliminary work was begun on this aspect and a predictive model is presented of the possible relationships within and between populations of karaka. 
It is concluded that the importance and extent of karaka arboriculture, and probably that of other endemic tree species, has previously been overlooked. This has implications for our view of certain plant communities as unmodified by humans, and provides an impetus to protect surface vegetation as an integral part of some prehistoric archaeological sites.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">Karaka</field><field name="subject">Corynocarpus laevigatus</field><field name="subject">ethnobotany</field><field name="subject">ethnobiology</field><field name="subject">Ra&#772;kau whakaruruhau</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070504.114356</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Tools for defining the public health perspective of Maori women : research methodologies and methods that contribute to the public health perspective of Maori women</field><field name="creator">Sargent, Melanie</field><field name="description">In the past, Maori experiences of research have been described by Jahnke and Taiapa (1999) as follows: 
 "Contemporary Maori society has become increasingly focused on issues of self-sufficiency, self-determination and whanau, hapu and iwi development. Attempts to address these issues have highlighted a lack of satisfactory research in respect of these and other Maori concerns. Much of the research done on Maori in the past has proven to be of little benefit to Maori themselves, tending to emphasise negative statistics without attempting to provide the information necessary to effect positive change. As a consequence, many Maori treat research with a degree of suspicion, questioning both the motives of researches and the methodologies employed" (p.37). 
 A number of tools have been used to define the public health of Maori, including Maori women. This dissertation aims to describe some of the methodologies and methods used in relation to analytical frameworks developed by leading Maori research academics such as Linda Tuhiwai Smith, in critiquing research undertaken defining the key public health issues for Maori women. Maori Health Researchers experiences of research, methodologies and methods used have also been determined based on qualitative interview techniques.

(James Oliver)</field><field name="description">The ambivalence of many prehistorians toward curio collections has meant that, although they recognise some of their shortcomings, they nevertheless use collections as if they had qualities of archaeological assemblages. In this dissertation it is posited and then demonstrated that curio collections are very different entities to archaeological assemblages. In order to use collections in valid constructions of New Zealand&#65533;s pre-European past, the processes that led to their formation need to be understood. It is only then that issues of representation can be addressed. 
 In order to better understand the collecting process, a study of the activity of 24 curio collectors who operated in the Murihiku region of southern New Zealand during the period between 1865 and 1975 was undertaken. The study was structured about two key notions: the idea of the &#65533;filter&#65533; and the idea that tools and ornaments have a &#65533;life history&#65533; that extends from the time that raw material was selected for the manufacture to the present. The notion of the filter made possible a determination of the effects of particular behaviours on patterns of collector selectivity and the extent and nature of provenance recording; and the extended concept of life history recognised that material culture functions in multiple cultural and chronological contexts-within both indigenous and post-contact spheres. 
 Examination of the collecting process led to the identification of five curio collecting paradigms: curio collecting for the acquisition of social status, curio collecting for financial return, curio collecting as an adjunct to natural history collecting, curio collecting as an adjunct to historical recording, and ethnological or culture-area curio collecting. Filtering processes associated with each paradigm resulted in particular, but not always distinctive, patterns of curio selectivity and styles of provenance recording. 
 A switch in the focus of attention from examination of curio collectng processes generally to the study of the filtering processes that shaped collections from a specific archaeological site-the pre-European Otago Peninsula site of Little Papanui (J44/1)- enabled some evaluation of individuual collection representation. A database recording up to 19 attributes for each of 6282 curios localised to &#65533;Little Papanui&#65533; in Otago Museum enabled 31 dedicated or &#65533;ardent&#65533; collectors who operated at the site to be identified. These 31 dedicated collectors were grouped according to the paradigm that best described their collecting behaviour. It was found that the greater proportion of these dedicated collectors (n=12, 39%) had been influenced by the ethnological or culture-area collecting paradigm. These 12 collectors were responsible for recovering a remarkable 5645 curios or nearly ninety-percent (89.86%) of the meta-collection. 
 Because curio collections lack meaningfully recorded stratigraphic provenance, it is the technological and social context in which tools and ornaments functioned that must become the focus of curio collection studies. Appropriate studies of technological and social and context focus upon evaluations of raw material sourcing, evaluations of manufacture technique and assessments of tool and ornament use and reuse (and integrative combinations of these modes of study). These sorts of evaluation require large collections compiled in the least selective manner possible and the collections need to be reliably localised to specific sites. Collections compiled by the ethnological or culture-area collectors have these qualities. Collections compiled within other paradigms lack locality information and were assembled in highly selective manners.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">Kai Tahu</field><field name="subject">South Island</field><field name="subject">Te Waipounamu</field><field name="subject">antiquities</field><field name="subject">collectors and collecting</field><field name="subject">historic sites</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070504.115610</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Funding contextual theology in Aotearoa - New Zealand : the theological contribution of James K. Baxter</field><field name="creator">Riddell, Michael</field><field name="description">Aotearoa-New Zealand received Christianity as part of the colonial/missionary matrix of nineteenth century European expansion. Consequently the form and content of faith was largely shaped by factors distant both in geography and symbolic resonance. Christian theology maintains a cultural dissonance, particularly from an emergent Pakeha cultural indentity.
	The quest for contextualisation has become a familiar one in post-colonial societies, though not as vigorously pursued in Western nations as in other parts of the world. Only recently has attention been paid to the possibilities of local theologies in New Zealand.
	C.S. Song&#65533;s suggests &#65533;Perhaps a poet can tell us how we should go about theology&#65533;. In this he is pointing to the necessity of contextual theology using domestic cultural product as an important source for theological reflection, encapsulating as it does local history and experience.
	James K. Baxter, one of New Zealand&#65533;s finest poets, was also a Catholic and social critic. In the last years of his life particularly, the major part of his writing, both poetry and prose, was concerned with his vision of a Christian humanism which might make a practical difference in the immediate context. He established a community at the small settlement of Jerusalem beside the Whanganui River, where he sought to give tangible expression to a mixture of radical Christian acceptance and Maori spiritual values.
	This thesis examines Baxter&#65533;s contribution to the task of contextual theology. In particular, it draws on a great deal of unpublished prose material, until now largely unexamined, from the late period of his life. This, together with the wider body of his writings, is used to investigate his religious thought and movement within it.
	After an introductory and methodological chapter, the thesis examines Baxter&#65533;s categorisation of the fragmented and spiritually bereft nature of Pakeha existence. It then seeks to follow the major themes of his own powerfully articulated responses to this condition, in a series of chapters introduced with Maori terms; a cultural connection which was important to Baxter.
	The investigation uncovers a commitment to a Christian humanism that recognises the immanence of Christ, and a rather startling manifesto which parallels the approach of Liberation Theology in a distinctly New Zealand context. The survey of Baxter&#65533;s religious thought concludes with a critical reflection on his themes.
	A final chapter considers the contribution which Baxter makes toward the challenge of contextual theology. Considering the relationship between poetic reflection and theology, it stops short of classifying Baxter as a theologian. Rather the argument is advanced that he has provided vital raw material to the ongoing task of local theology; his role is one of &#65533;funding&#65533; contextual theology symbolically. Baxter is significant in the development of theology in Aotearoa-New Zealand, both for his contribution and his encouragement to further reflection.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">James K.

The aim of the Kai o te Hauora Training is to empower iwi and Maori communities with the skills, knowledge and resources to enable them to make informed decisions about their nutritional health.
	The research methods were grounded in Kaupapa Maori research methodology. Three community members who have taken part in the Kai o te Hauora training were interviewed as well as those people with whom they have networked within the wider community. Formal unstructured interviews were carried out with a total of twenty-three people over a twenty month period from November 1998 to June 2000. The interviews were each transcribed and analysed for key themes. The results of the interviews documented the changes in behaviour and attitudes toward nutrition for the Maori community in the Whakatane region, through the stories of the three community members who had taken part in the training. Their successes and difficulties in attempting to influence change were also recorded.
	The success of the Kai o te Hauora training in relation to the literature is discussed. The importance of working from a Kaupapa Maori framework in both nutrition interventions and research relating to Maori is emphasised. This framework inherently acknowledges the importance of Maori networks, values and concepts. The importance of the Kai o te Hauora training principle of empowerment is also acknowledged as being fundamental to the programmes success. The need for further research to measure the impact of the Kai o te Hauora programme, and Maori women&#65533;s contributions to their communities is noted, as is the need for this research to have been carried out within a Kaupapa Maori framework.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">hauora</field><field name="subject">health</field><field name="subject">nutrition</field><field name="subject">food</field><field name="subject">kai totika</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070507.111203</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome : symptoms and risk factors among Maori and non-Maori adults in Aotearoa</field><field name="creator">Harris, Ricci</field><field name="description">More is becoming known about the importance of sleep to health, with inadequate sleep recognised as a significant public health issue. Sleep clinics have reported disproportionate numbers of Ma&#772;ori and Pacific peoples with more severe obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome (OSAS), raising concerns about accessibility of services and possible differences in prevalence between ethnic groups.
	Prevalence information on sleep disorders in Aotearoa is needed to assess its public health impact and plan for population health care needs. This thesis presents a national study examining the prevalence of OSAS symptoms and risk factors among Maori and non-Maori adults in Aotearoa.
	This project is also situated within the wider scope of ethnic inequalities in health between Maori and non-Maori and is concerned with making a positive contribution to Maori health and the elimination of disparities. Kaupapa Maori Research (KMR) is the underlying methodology that drives this study. As such, it assumes a Maori norm, and prioritises Maori needs. A Maori/non-Maori analytical framework is used that distinguishes Maori as tangata whenua, addresses Maori health needs as well as non-Maori, and enables the monitoring of guarantees as outlined by the Treaty of Waitangi.
	The goals of this thesis were to estimate the prevalence of OSAS symptoms and risk factors among Maori and non-Maori adults in New Zealand, and to examine independent predictive variables for specific OSAS symptoms. An objective was also to contribute to KMR through designing and undertaking a KMR project using a quantitative method, with the development of concepts for use in other areas of research.
	In April 1999, a short questionnaire was sent to a sample of 10000 New Zealands (5500 of Maori descent and 4500 non-Maori participants to enable research questions to be examined with equal statistical power for both groups.
	The results demonstrate that the prevalence of OSAS symptoms and risk factors, particularly among non-Maori, are comparable to other international studies, indicating that OSAS is likely to be a common problem among adults in Aotearoa. Furthermore, the results suggest that Maori are significantly more likely to suffer from OSAS than non-Maori, with higher rates of symptoms and risk factors of OSAS among both men and women. As an area of medicine that is under-serviced in Aotearoa, the results provide important information with which to plan for population needs.
	There are a number of health implications from this study, relating specifically to the diagnosis and management of OSAS in Aotearoa, and to Maori health and the elimination of disparities. These are multi-levelled and include health service implications across the continuum of care, from specialist sleep services to primary care; public health implications that involve preventive measures and broader determinants of health; and KMR principles that can be applied to interventions and health research in general. As a KMR project the implications and recommendations focus on Maori health research in general. As a KMR project the implications and recommendations focus on Maori health gain and addressing disparities in health. This is consistent with Maori health rights, and a population approach that considers health inequalities and the role of wider determinants of health and health services.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">hauora</field><field name="subject">health</field><field name="subject">sleep apnoea syndromes</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070507.112047</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Load-bearing structures : Pakeha identity and the cross-cultural poetry of James K. Baxter and Glenn Colquhoun</field><field name="creator">Dennison, John Sebastian</field><field name="description">Pakeha identity has long been problematic, caught in a straddling stance between European co-ordinates of origin, and life in Aotearoa. This has been particularly evident over the last three decades: with the rise of tino rangatiratanga, Pakeha identity has undergone something of a crisis. Group identity, especially in such periods of crisis, requires &#65533;narratives&#65533; that re-imagine being and belonging. Poetry by Pakeha both displays the problem with identity at the cross cultural threshold between Maori and Pakeha, asking &#65533; what happens when Pakeha engage cross-culturally with te ao Maori, appropriating te reo Maori and drawing on Maoritanga, to re-vision and reconfigure identity? And how does such an approach shape the imagining of Pakeha identity?&#65533;
	I study, in parallel, the cross-cultural poetry of James K. Baxter and Glen Colquhoun in relation to these questions. Borrowing a conceptual metaphor from Colin McCahon, I examine these cross-cultural poems in detail as &#65533;load-bearing structures&#65533;. I pay particular attention to the way in which, in purpose, design and materials, they function to re-imagine Pakeha identity in reciprocal relationship with te ao Maori. Aware of the problems of culture-crossing, at the outset I establish a historical and interpretive framework for the poetry. Furthermore, I discuss the question of appropriation, arguing for an ethical distinction between appropriation and misappropriation based on a cross-cultural relationship of faithful and reciprocal engagement.
	I conclude that Baxter and Colquhoun are singular and radical in their reconfiguration of Pakeha identity. Baxter embraces te ao Maori in a direct challenge to Pakeha nationalism, prescribing the necessary corrective of the tuakana-teina dynamic to Pakeha identity and its relationship with te ao Maori. Writing after the Maori renaissance, Glenn Colquhoun irreverently opens up a further reconfiguration of cross-cultural relationship, pushing both Maori and Pakeha beyond a cultural dichotomy towards a mutually defining complementarity. Both place themselves on the cultural threshold of language, embracing the tensions of the cross-cultural scenario. The result is cross-cultural poetry, load-bearing structures that manifest the tension and ambivalence of the settler culture&#65533;s straddling identity, enacting what it is to be Pakeha.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">James K.

Iwi and hapu throughout New Zealand have close relationships with the coast and unique rights and responsibilities for its future management. However, there does not appear to be wide recognition of the crucial role of Maori in New Zealand&#65533;s coastal management regime.
	Co-management initiatives in coastal management, particularly under the Conservation Act 1987, Resource Management Act 1991 and several legislative initiatives controlling fisheries management, are explored and critiqued. Overall, the initiatives demonstrate that progress is being made in coastal management for better protection of Maori coastal values. Nevertheless, there is scope for further improvements concerning greater Maori involvement in coastal management.
	Recommendations for genuine co-management systems in New Zealand&#65533;s coastal management regime include effective communication between iwi and Government; appreciation of the unique nature of each iwi in New Zealand; involvement of a third party communicating between iwi and Government representatives; appropriate funding and resources to maintain the co-management system, and encouragement and motivation from the Government to initiate and maintain the co-management system.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">kaitiakitanga</field><field name="subject">coastal zone management</field><field name="subject">citizen participation</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070507.114028</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of the dental therapist in New Zealand's public health system</field><field name="creator">Tane, Helen Rose</field><field name="description">This study examines aspects of how dental therapy began and developed, since it was introduced as one of the first public health occupations in New Zealand, in 1921. Dental therapy began as dental nursing, and was introduced by visionary dentists in order to treat widespread dental disease within the New Zealand population. The occupation gained international recognition. Dental nurses performed their tasks under the direct supervision and direction of a public health dentist and the occupation was restricted to females and child-patients.
	Investigating issues that have influenced the development of dental therapy is critical in today&#65533;s climate. Background research in the thesis reveals an interplay of issues relating to gender, professional development and measures of how successful the occupation has been in relation to oral health need. The latter is particularly questionable for our indigenous people in New Zealand. How has the role of the dental therapist in New Zealand been utilised? Has the delivery of care been based on sound knowledge and dental need? Has the role progressed in order to provide effective and appropriate care within a publicly funded system? These issues are important issues, particularly when New Zealand&#65533;s dental therapy profession becomes one of the many health professions that will be affected by the new Health Practitioners Competence Assurance Act when it is implented over the following year.
	In order to improve oral health for the population, it is vital that the dental therapist is appropriately and effectively utilised. How oral health workers perceive the past role and future role in achieving oral health gain is investigated in this study by using interviews and postal surveys, and the results are discussed.
	The findings show that the dental therapist has not always been utilised and developed using sound epidemiological evidence. Elements of professional protection by the dental profession coupled with depleted health funding rather than dental need have appeared as driving factors. Furthermore, the dental therapy profession has remained in a sub-ordinate role to the dental profession. The findings of this study show that a large number of the current dental therapy workforce do not feel that they are ready to provide dental care autonomously.
	Information in the thesis argues that past legislation and subordination to the dental profession has largely affected the development of dental therapy, and whether this has always assisted in improving oral health for the New Zealand population is questioned in this work. With a depleted number in the workforce, the role has become focussed on a reparative form of care, not one that promotes and improves oral health. This is not acceptable in a publicly funded system.

(Christopher James Daniel)</field><field name="description">This thesis describes a systemic approach to the study of shell remains, using material from the site of Shag Point (J43/11), in North Otago. This approach analyses the relationship between sampling, identification, quantification, and site formation processes. An historical and methodological framework is used to assess the analysis of shell-bearing deposits in New Zealand, and provide innovative solutions to bias. Historical research outlines the common research methods in New Zealand, which are relevant to Shag Point. Methodological research outlines the range of potential research methods used in the study of shell-bearing deposits. Reviewing the data from Shag Point, sampling, identification, quantification, and site formation processes are used to assess the quality of data from the site. Data from coastal sites are commonly used to generate regional level syntheses. These syntheses do not deal with all of the possible sources of bias in shell-bearing deposits. Cumulative sampling is used to assess representativeness. The data from Shag Point are indicative of a representative sample. The site is compared to three other coastal southern South Island assemblages: the nearby Shag River Mouth, Pleasant River, and Pounawea. The data from Shag River Mouth may be representative; the same cannot be said for the Pleasant River and Pounawea archaeological assemblages, thus hampering regional-level syntheses.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Archaeology</field><field name="subject">antiquities</field><field name="subject">prehistoric</field><field name="subject">Kai Tahu</field><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">excavations</field><field name="subject">shell deposits</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070507.115526</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Indigenous communities and the co-management of natural resources : the case of New Zealand freshwater management</field><field name="creator">Tipa, Gail</field><field name="description">The starting point for this study is a socially constructed problem: the progressive degradation of natural resources of significance to indigenous communities and the lack of effective participation by indigenous communities in their management. For many indigenous communities survival was traditionally dependent upon knowledge of natural resources and the ability to gather sustainability those resources from lands, waterbodies and the seas within tribal territories. Environmental sustainability and the long term wellbeing of indigenous communities were seen as one and the same thing. But following contact with exogenous groups, and until relatively recently, indigenous perspectives on environmental management were largely ignored. Dispute over ownership, access to management and use of natural resources have been sources of long standing grievance for indigenous communities throughout the world including Maori within New Zealand.
	In the last decade co-management has been promoted as a means of ensuring the participation of indigenous communities in contemporary resource management. But what is meant by co-management has been less clear.
	This thesis posits that of the four possible definitions of co-management - namely dual management, cooperative management, collagorative management and community based management - it is collaborative management that promises the greatest benefits for indigenous populations and the environment alike. An analytical framework is developed which acknowledges the theories brought to such collaboration by State agencies and Maori in New Zealand. A case example is then presented of the establishment of a collaborative management programme involving freshwater in the Taieri Catchment near Dunedin.
	Experience of this case suggests that in addition to affirming progressively validated general principles governing collaborative environmental management, the requirement for trusted facilitators acting at the interface between State agency and indigenous groups is mandatory. It is concluded that the potential exists for the collaborative management of environmental resources by State and Maori in New Zealand but that the process has barely begun and requires investment in capacity building on the part of both parties.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">kaitiakitanga</field><field name="subject">indigenous people</field><field name="subject">water quality management</field><field name="subject">environmental management</field><field name="subject">natural resources</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070508.124012</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The theoretical and practical dimensions of pounamu management</field><field name="creator">Hope-Pearson, E.W.</field><field name="description">The vesting of pounamu back to Te Runanga o Ngai Tahu brings to the fore a whole new dimension of resource mangement to New Zealand&#65533;s wider resource management environment. As is highlighted in this study and noted by a number of academics, Maori people, like other indigenous communities, have their own planning systems values and appropriate processes for decision-making about the environment. But the relevance of such indigenous management systems has long been overlooked by the decision makers and authorities to the continued frustration and anxiety of indigenous peoples. This lack of recognition has been at the fore as a concept fundamental to many indigenous peoples grievances, both past and present. The subsequent vesting of pounamu has brought about the validation that Maori have to resource management rights.
	In identifying issues associated with the management of natural resources by indigenous peoples, this study provides an examination of number theoretical concepts and a practical dimension associated with the management of natural resources by indigenous peoples and has placed pounamu in context. The placement of pounamu in context has provided the basis from which a number of central issues were identified and discussed.
	A combination a literature study, analysis of an application traditional knowledge in a contemporary context and in-depth interviews and liaison with key stakeholders involved directly and indirectly in the management of pounmau were undertaken, has established that the management of natural resources by indigenous people is more about the management of number of associated processes rather than about the management of a single commodity, in this instance pounamu. Within these processes there exist a number of complex relationships that reflect the fundamental transaction of power and privilege associated with natural resource management. Further conclusions that this study has made, is the increasing need and importance of legislatures and planning professionals alike to further recognise the validity and become familiar with alternate methods of resource management and the application of indigenous systems and methods.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">Kai Tahu</field><field name="subject">Pounamu</field><field name="subject">Greenstone</field><field name="subject">natural resources management</field><field name="subject">indigenous peoples</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070508.125737</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Te Tiriti o Waitangi and the management of national parks in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Ruru, Jacinta Arianna</field><field name="description">This thesis assesses the historical and current legislative provision for including nga iwi Maori in the management of national parks. The method of assessment is one of comparison between the legislative provisions and the guarantees promised to nga iwi Maori in te Tiriti o Waitangi.
	Part One, Chapter One, establishes the relevance of te Tiriti o Waitangi to the management of national parks. This chapter is designed to act as the benchmark for the assessment of national park legislation.
	Part Two outlines the early national park legislation. Chapter Two begins by focusing on the emergence of the national park estate in the late nineteenth, and early twentieth, centuries. Chapter Three focuses on the first consolidated national park statute, the National Parks Act 1952.
	Part Three assesses the present statutory provision for including nga iwi Maori in national park management. Chapter Four focuses on the original provisions of the National Parks Act 1980. Chapters Five, Six and Seven focus respectively on the major statutory amendments since made to the National Parks Act 1980: the Conservation Act 1987, the Conservation Law Reform Act 1990, and the Ngai Tahu Claims Settlement Act 1998. Chapter Eight turns to assess national park management documents.
	Part Four, Chapter Nine, concludes by exploring how legislation could be used in the future to provide for the Tiriti right of nga iwi Maori to be included in the management of national parks.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">katiakitanga</field><field name="subject">national parks</field><field name="subject">resource management</field><field name="subject">environmental law</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070508.135325</field></doc><doc><field name="title">What is a fern-root beater? The correlation of museum artefacts and ethno-historical descriptions</field><field name="creator">Purdue, Carla J</field><field name="description">The rhizome of the bracken fern was an important part of the subsistence base of the pre-contact Maori of Aotearoa. It provided an essential source of starch - especially to the southern Maori, who relied mainly upon wild resources for the vegetable component of their diet. The preparation of the rhizome (or fern-root) for consumption necessitated the beating of the cooked root upon a smooth stone anvil. The implement that was used to beat the fern-root is an important Maori tool which, until now, has had little detailed attention paid to it. Therefore, the aim of this research was to characterize the form of the fern-beater using morphological attributes. Through the combination of a comprehensive literature review of enthographic-historical accounts and more contemporary documentary research, along with a nationwide survey of implements labelled as "fern-root beaters" in museum collections, this thesis identifies a number of critical and common attributes that are inherent in a beating implement. It was found that wooden and stone beaters/pounders were dissimilar in size and proportions, with the majority of wooden implements displayed larger circumference dimensions, were shorter and considerably heavier, thus casting some doubt on their practicality as a beating implement. Four distinct morphological forms were identified for both the wooden and stone items surveyed, and it was found that metric variables were more significant in suggesting function than non-metric. Regional distribution analysis of the survey implements highlighted a northern North Island predominance, particularly in the Northland, Auckland, Taranaki and Waikato regions. A tenuous comparison with Simpson&#65533;s distribution of prehistoric dental attrition known as "fern-root plane" showed a loose regional correlation, however; the actual cause of this tooth wear is still a hotly contested issue.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">antiquities</field><field name="subject">Rarauhe</field><field name="subject">archaeology</field><field name="subject">excavations</field><field name="subject">implements</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070508.135954</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Making culture or making culture possible : notions of biculturalism in New Zealand 1980s cinema and the role of the New Zealand Film Commission</field><field name="creator">Kontour, Kyle</field><field name="description">In the 1970s and 1980s New Zealand experienced significant socio-economic upheaval due in part to the global economy, economic experiments, and the gains of Maori activism. Despite the divisiveness of this period (or possibly because of it), anxieties over notions of New Zealand national identity were heightened. There was a general feeling among many Kiwis that New Zealand culture (however it was defined) was in danger of extinction, mostly due to the dominant influences of the United states and Britain. New Zealanders sought ways to distinguish themselves and their nation. One of the ways in which this desire was manifested was in the establishment of the New Zealand Film Commission (NZFC). This government sponsored body corporate was designed to provide an infrastructure for New Zealand filmmaking, through which New Zealand and New Zealanders could be represented. As a result, New Zealand filmmaking boomed during the early to mid-1980s. Significantly, this boom occurred simultaneous to the increasing relevance and importance of notions of biculturalism, both in cultural and socio-political terms.
	The question that drives this thesis is how (or whether) biculturalism was articulated in the explicit or implicit relationships between cultural debates, governmental policies, the NZFC&#65533;s own policies and practices and its interaction with filmmakers. This thesis examines the ways in which aspects of the discourse of biculturalism feature in New Zealand cinema of the 1980s in terms of the content, development, production and marketing of three films of this era that share particular bicultural themes and elements: Utu (Geoff Murphy, 1983), The Quiet Earth (Geoff Murphy, 1985) and Arriving Tuesday (Richard Riddiford, 1986). This thesis also examines the role of the NZFC in these processes as prescribed by legislation and in terms of the NZFC&#65533;s own policies and procedures.
	This thesis consults a variety of primary and secondary sources in its research. Primary sources include film texts, public documents, archival material, trade journals, and interviews with important figures in the New Zealand film industry.
	Conclusions suggest that the interaction of numerous socio-historical factors, and the practices and policies of the NZFC, denote a process that was not direct in its articulation of notions of biculturalism. Rather, this involved an array of complex cultural, fiscal. industrial, professional and aesthetic forces.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Motion picture industry</field><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">biculturalism</field><field name="subject">history</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070508.140943</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Bicultural nationhood in the bonds of capital</field><field name="creator">Begg, Anne</field><field name="description">This thesis approaches the issue of bicultural nationhood as articulated through a Maori/Pakeha binary in Aotearoa/New Zealand by interrogating the deeply entrenched social forms that inform liberal democracy and that institutionalize capitalism in the modern nation-state. More specifically, it explores the concepts of &#65533;self-governing people&#65533;, &#65533;public sphere&#65533; and &#65533;free market&#65533; as three forms of collective agency that discursively construct &#65533;society&#65533; within the social imaginary and that interact to set the terms of democratic citizenship. Central to this discussion is the indigenous/non-indigenous binary constituting biculturalism and the manifestation of &#65533;indigeneity&#65533; as both unassimilable difference in the project of modernity and as political struggle for recognition and power. This study elaborates through the mediated texts of the mediasphere and argues that there is a constant relation between nation, culture and class wherein culture-as-difference provides a framework for masking class struggle in capitalist relations of production as well as for enabling the dominant group to discursively construct their own ethnicity as national cultural identity.
	What is at stake in this discussion is the contrast between cultural difference as it emerges in the performance of everyday life and as reaction to issues of economic marginalization and cultural difference as it is contrived by the nation-state in terms of a Maori/Pakeha binary. The aim of this thesis is to highlight the necessity of difference in cultural identified, labeled and marketed as a fixed concept, but is an ephemeral by-product of ongoing social struggle for survival, recognition and political power. The objective is to undercut current ideological propositions and demand a just, equitable and democratic approach to the conceptualization of nationhood in Aotearoa/New Zealand.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">biculturalism</field><field name="subject">political culture</field><field name="subject">democracy</field><field name="subject">citizenship</field><field name="subject">indigenous peoples</field><field name="subject">government</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070508.142710</field></doc><doc><field name="title">What is Maori patient-centered medicine for Pakeha general practitioners?</field><field name="creator">Colquhoun, D. (David James)</field><field name="description">This research was designed to see whether the clinical method espoused by Moira Stewart et al in the book "Patient-Centered: Transforming The Clinical Method" is appropriate for Pakeha general practitioners to use in clinical consultations with Maori patients.
	This thesis uses qualitative methodology. One of my supervisors and I selected from the kuia (old women) and kaumatua (old men) of Hauraki those whom I would approach to be involved. Nearly all responded in the affirmative.
	The kuia and kaumatua talked about their tikanga, about the basis of tikanga, about the spirituality of their Maori worldview. They talked about the need to maintain their tikanga, about qualities that they respect. They described different roles within Maoridom, especially those of the kuia, whaea (mothers) and Tohunga (experts). They refer to a GP as a Tohunga because of the GP&#65533;s special expertise. The GP is able to use his or her special expertise to heal Maori patients, but needs to be able to get through barriers to do so. They are also clear that Maori and Pakeha live in two different worlds which can merge in some circumstances.
	I came to two conclusions. The first is that the elements of Patient-Centered Medicine are relevant to the consultation of a Pakeha GP and Maori patient, and provides a framework that is productive. The second conclusion is that there is a better framework for working with Maori patients, within which Patient-Centered Medicine can be practiced more effectively. Maori already have a framework (tikanga) in which they function, and if in their settings, especially the marae, he or she is welcomed and has a place in their world; tikanga accommodates the GP as a Tohunga and Maori respond to him or her as such.
	In summary, a Pakeha GP who has some knowledge of tikanga or Maori culture and who has a basic knowledge of the Maori language of tikanga of Maori culture and who has a basic knowledge of the Maori language can work very well for his or her Maori patients by working within the framework of Tikanga Maori and by being patient-centered in consultation.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">hauora</field><field name="subject">medical care</field><field name="subject">family medicine</field><field name="subject">physicians</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070508.144541</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Selectivity versus availability: patterns of prehistoric fish and shellfish exploitation at Triangle Flat, western Golden Bay</field><field name="creator">Brooks, Emma</field><field name="description">This thesis sets out to examine issues of selectivity and availability in fishing and shellfish gathering by pre-European Maori at Triangle Flat in western Golden Bay. Faunal remains from four archaeological sites have revealed new and valuable information about economic subsistence practices in this region.
	It is proposed that exploitation of these important coastal resources was based on factors other than the availability of, proximity to resource patches. Evidence from the Triangle Flat sites is compared to that from Tasman Bay and the southern North Island to gain a regional perspective on fishing and shellfish gathering strategies.
	The most definitive evidence for selective targeting is provided by tuatua, an open beach species that has been found to dominate in sites based adjacent to tidal mud and sand flats. Also of interest is the dominance of mud snail in a site that is adjacent to large cockle and pipi beds. When regional sites were examined it was found that this pattern was also recorded for the site of Appleby in Tasman Bay.
	Selectivity in fishing strategies is also apparent with red cod and barracouta dominating the Triangle Flat assemblages. This pattern conforms to evidence from both eastern Golden Bay and Tasman Bay but does not reflect evidence from the southern North Island. Of particular interest is the apparent dearth of snapper in the sites at Triangle Flat, since snapper abounds in the area today. An explanation based on climatic change is considered to be the most feasible. This indicates that enviromentalal availability was at least in part responsible for the archaeological evidence of fishing. The consistency of the catch of red cod and barracouta in Golden Bay, and the pattern of shellfishing preferentially for tuatua suggests that cultural choice was also a significant selective factor.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">South Island</field><field name="subject">kitchen middens</field><field name="subject">mahinga kai</field><field name="subject">prehistoric fishing</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070508.145145</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The decolonisation of culture, the trickster as transformer in native Canadian and Maori fiction</field><field name="creator">Anderson, Robyn Lisa</field><field name="description">The trickster is a powerful figure of transformation in many societies, including Native Canadian and Maori cultures. As a demi-god, the trickster has the ability to assume the shape of a variety of animals and humans, but is typically associated with one particular form. In Native Canadian tribes, the trickster is identified as an animal and can range from a Raven to a Coyote, depending on the tribal mythologies from which he/she is derived. In Maori culture, Maui is the trickster figure and is conceptualised as a human male. In this thesis, I discuss how the traditional trickster is contexualised in the contemporary texts of both Native Canadian and Maori writers. Thomas King, Lee Maracle, Witi Ihimaera, and Patricia Grace all use the trickster figure, and the tricksterish strategies of creation/destruction, pedagogy, and humour to facilitate the decolonisation of culture within the textual realms of their novels. The trickster enables the destruction of stereotyped representations of colonised peoples and the creation of revised portrayals of these communities from an indigenous perspective. These recreated realities aid in teaching indigenous communities the strengths inherent in their cultural traditions, and foreground the use of comedy as an effective pedagogical device and subversive weapon. Although the use of trickster is considerable in both Maori and Native Canadian texts, it tends to be more explicit in the latter. A number of possibilities for these differences are considered.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">literature and folklore</field><field name="subject">Canada</field><field name="subject">indigenous peoples</field><field name="subject">history</field><field name="subject">fiction</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070508.145908</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Construction of the savage : western intellectual responses to the Maori and Aborigine, first contact to 1850</field><field name="creator">Wybrow, Vernon</field><field name="description">This thesis is a comparative study of the West&#65533;s intellectual responses to the indigenous inhabitants of Australia and New Zealand from the period of first contact through until 1850.

Specifically it focusses on Maatua Whangai O Otepoti, examining the discourses of care-givers within this context. Further, this research is constructed within a Maori world view of both traditional fostercare practices and State interpretations of those practices. Case studies of the discourses of caregivers within the Maatua Whangai Programme are described and articulated in terms of kaupapa Maori research methods. The data generated identifies the discourses of the caregivers and their desire to have their voices heard. In contrast, the discourse of the state is examined in the light of reports such as Puao-Te-Ata-Tu (1986), and the work of Bradley (1994) and Ruwhiu (1995). It is argued that any shift in the current dominance of power relationships surrounding the Maatua Whangai Programme and fostercare practices in relation to Maori would entail a strengthening of ties between service providers, Iwi and the Crown. This would go some way towards redressing Crown dominance of Maori fostercare practices.

The term itself is one used variously to represent for us as Iwi, the land and the sea including flora and fauna. The Kai Tahu landscape is Papatuanuku, our cosmological mother. Particular areas used for the case studies include the following marae: Otakou, Karitane, Kaikoura, Tuahiwi, Ka marae e toru o Horomaka, Taumutu, Te Tai Poutini, Hukanui, Waihopai, Arowhenua, Oraka, Awarua and the many places of te rohe potae o Kai Tahu i Te Waipounamu. Material was drawn from literature, the participants formally interviewed and many from within and outside Kai Tahu rohe potae. All responses are used to illustrate the ways in which Kai Tahu and some of their non-Kai Tahu spouses express particular definitions of what for each, constitutes and is constituted in the landscape.
	Kai Tahu participants&#65533; landscape definition includes whakapapa, placenames, identity (personal and cultural), spirituality and sustenance. Elements of these are present to a similar degree for some of the spouses, but not all. This seems largely dependent upon the degree to which they have participated in matters pertaining to Kai Tahu. Degrees of participation and connection may be applied to Tahu people alienated from their kaik, whether urbanised near or distantly domiciled.
	Theoretical bases in literature from a number of disciplines are used to discuss perceptions of what anthropologists more usually term &#65533;place&#65533; and how Kai Tahu fit this or choose to fit the understanding of cultural others into our world view. The research also looks briefly at the environmental landscape and who presently has power and therefore mana over its use and or misuse, especially in relation to management of Papatuanuku.
	Due to the [sic] of the type [sic] project this thesis is, it cannot finally conclude there is a single Kai Tahu or gender specific perception of landscape. This would never be provable in any circumstance, since it is not scientifically based. It does however, suggest there is an indigenous perspective of landscape that differs from certain Western thinking and within the indigenous perspective, a Kai Tahu epistemological understanding of the landscape based on our theory and knowledge of ourselves.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">Kai Tahu</field><field name="subject">landscape</field><field name="subject">antiquities</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070508.151703</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Kia uruuru mai a hauora : being healthy, being Maori: conceptualising Maori health promotion.</field><field name="creator">Ratima, M. M (Mihi M.)</field><field name="description">The Decade of Maori Development (1984-1994) stimulated the re-emergence of distinctly Maori approaches to progressing their own advancement. Maori health promotion is one such approach that has a central concern for improving Maori health outcomes. A range of Maori collectives are providing what they claim to be distinctly Maori health promotion initiatives. However, Maori health promotion has a pragmatic orientation, and this has, at least in part, led to conceptual and theoretical under-development. There is an almost complete lack of empirically and theoretically sound work to conceptualise Maori health promotion. This research programme has focused on identifying the defining characteristics of Maori health promotion.
	The primary data source for this research programme was three case studies of Maori health promotion interventions.
	Tipu Ora - a Maori community-based well-child programme;
	the Plunket Kaiawhina Service - a national Maori focussed initiative located within a mainstream service; and,
	the Wairarapa Maori Asthma Project - a tribally-based asthma management initiative.
	The main source of data in each of the case studies was in-depth open-ended interviews with programme participants and stakeholders. Data was also drawn from document review and archival records.
	The findings of this research indicate that Maori health promotion is based on a broad concept of health, which can be expanded as the basis for a more general argument for Maori advancement. Maori health promotion is the process of enabling Maori to increase control over the determinants of health and strengthen their identity as Maori, and thereby improve their health and position in society. Its defining characteristics have been identified in this research programme, and presented in &#65533;Kia uruuru mai a hauora&#65533;, a framework for Maori health promotion. The Framework has the potential to provide the basis for a more consistent and rigorous approach to Maori health promotion practice, policy, purchasing, and research. Aspects of the Framework may also have wider application to generic health promotion and other indigenous peoples&#65533; approaches to health promotion.
	This study concludes that Maori health promotion draws primarily on the heritage and new knowledge that arises from Maori and Western experiences. However, it remains grounded in the distinctive concepts and values of Maori worldviews. Maori health promotion is a distinctly Maori process, in step with and indigenous health promotion, but primarily on the determination of Maori to be Maori.</field><field name="date">2001,</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">hauora</field><field name="subject">health</field><field name="subject">health promotion</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070508.152546</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The political economy of Maori protest politics, 1968-1995 : a Marxist analysis of the roots of Maori oppression and the politics of resistance</field><field name="creator">Poata-Smith, E.S Te Ahu</field><field name="description">This thesis provides a Marxist analysis of the political economy of contemporary Maori protest politics in the years from 1968 to 1995. It is argued that Maori protest politics embraces a range of competing political ideologies, which are informed by different assumptions about the causes of Maori inequality in wider society, and in turn, different sets of strategies for ameliorating and transcending that inequality.
	Overall, the thesis has two central concerns: firstly, it identifies the critical economic, political and ideological conditions and context that have allowed particular competing political ideologies and strategies to dominate contemporary Maori protest politics. This involves a particular focus on understanding and explaining the rise of identity politics and cultural nationalism as the dominant political strategy within Maori protest politics. This involves a particular focus on understanding and explaining the rise of identity politics and cultural nationalism as the dominant political strategy within Maori protest politics. Secondly, the thesis critically assesses the effectiveness of contemporary Maori struggles against racism and oppression on the basis of whether they involve, or are likely to contribute towards, the transformation of the generative structures that give rise to manifest inequalities between Maori and non-Maori. It is argued that the systematic alienation of land and the inequality that exists between Maori and non-Maori are not simply the result of the underlying cultural values of individual non-Maori but are rather the result of the historical process of capitalist development in Aotearoa and the economic, political and ideological requirements necessary for the generalised commodification of indigenous labour-power.
	The thesis explores how the politics and practice of Maori protest has been shaped and influenced to a large extent by the underlying social, economic, political and ideological forces of global capitalism. It is argued that the international collapse of the long boom, the global upturn in class struggle and the emergence of the New Left internationally from the late 1960s had an enormous influence on the political direction of Maori protest in the New Zealand context. The success of the working class offensive and the growing political influence of rank and file Maori workers ensured that Maori protest groups formed part of the progressive social movements of the time. Indeed, although some were explicitly nationalist in their orientation, these movements were consciously part of the Left.
	The balance of political forces within the Maori protest movement changed considerably during the late 1970s and early 1980s with the rise of the New Right as a political force internationally together with the rise of employer militancy, the defeat and demoralization of the working class movement internationally, the decline of the social movements and the absence of mass struggle. This had important implications for the influence of the various ideological factions that co-existed uneasily in the Maori political milieu from the early 1970s onwards. The downturn in militant mass struggle saw the rise in the influence of identity politics as cultural nationalist strategies came to dominate Maori protest politics, representing a fundamental retreat from Left-wing ideas. In practice this entailed a rejection of the class politics and mass struggle that had informed the politics and strategies of Maori protest groups from the late 1960s, and its replacement with a politics of cross-class alliances and a personal rejection of &#65533;Pakeha society&#65533;. In practice this was a recipe for passivity and divisiveness within the Maori protest movement itself.
	The politics of cultural nationalism left Maori ill-equipped to resist the ruling class counter-offensive and the anti-working class policies that successive governments introduced to restore the conditions for profitable capital accumulation. In particular, the rejection of a class analysis of Maori inequality in capitalist society has undermined the capacity of working class Maori to resist the neo-liberal agenda and a Treaty of Waitangi settlement process that has resulted in a substantial shift in resources to those sections of Maori society already wealthy and powerful. Although the settlement process represented an important concession by the state, it has never compensated for the anti-working class policies of governments since 1984, which have widened the social and economic inequalities in New Zealand society. In this way, the emphasis on cultural identity alone as the determining factor in Maori oppression has been counter-productive for working class Maori as successive governments shifted the costs of the economic crisis on to the weakest sections of the community.
	As New Zealand entered a new period of economic and social crisis in the 1990s, the commercial interests of Maori tribal executives, Maori corporate enterprises, and the Maori bureaucracy were clearly at odds with the material interests of the vast majority of working class Maori families. This fundamental conflict in class interests was to set the scene for a revival of militancy on scale not seen since the 1970s.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">government relations</field><field name="subject">tino rangatiratanga</field><field name="subject">self-determination</field><field name="subject">social classes</field><field name="subject">race relations</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070508.153703</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation of polaron, bipolaron and exciton structures in oligothiophenes : a resonance raman and theoretical study</field><field name="creator">Clarke, Tracey Michelle</field><field name="description">This thesis presents a spectroscopic and computational study of a variety of substituted oligothiophenes. The purpose of this study was to elucidate the structural properties of their neutral, oxidised and excited states. This was accomplished using a number of spectroscopic methods, including electronic absorption, resonance Raman and fluorescence spectroscopy. Analysis of the data provided by these methods was aided by the application of density functional theory (DFT) to the neutral and charged species, allowing conclusions regarding bond length changes and molecular orbitals to be drawn. Advancing the understanding of the structural properties of conductive materials such as oligothiophenes is important due to their potential application in plastic electronic devices (organic solar cells, field effect transistors and light emitting diodes, for instance) and the need to clarify the charge transport mechanism. 
 The compounds examined in this thesis are primarily based on 3&#65533; styryl-substituted terthiophene. Substituted derivatives of this molecule include those with groups on the para position of the phenyl ring or methyl &#945;,&#945;&#65533; end caps. Larger ethenyl-aryl groups were also investigated, as were analogous thiophenes and sexithiophenes. Indeed, the 3&#65533;-substituted sexithiophenes formed an integral part of this investigation since they rapidly form in the head-to-head orientation from the oxidation and consequent [sigma]-dimerisation of the substituted terthiophenes. 
 DFT calculations on the sexithiophene charged species have indicated the presence of a full polaronic or bipolaronic structural defect in the centre of the thiophene backbone, as defined by the reversal of the CC bond length alternation to create a domain of quinoidal bond sequence. However, the structural defect of the styryl sexithiophenes is more strongly localised than that observed for unsubstituted sexithiophene; indeed, the charged defect appears to be confined by the positions of the styryl substituents. This defect confinement along the thiophene backbone is particularly apparent in the styryl sexithiophene dications. 
 Electronic absorption and resonance Raman spectroscopy have been applied to the oxidation products of the styryl terthiophenes. Only sexithiophene charged species are observed when the &#945; termini are unsubstituted; these include sexithiophene radical cations, [pi]-dimers (a stabilising face-to-face interaction between two radical cations) and dications. The resonance Raman spectra of these charged species are characterised by a very intense symmetrical CC stretching mode of the thiophene inter-ring bonds, which is also evident in the theoretical spectra. The extensive differences between the styryl and unsubstituted sexithiophene dication Raman spectra have been attributed to defect confinement: the strongest Raman band of the unsubstituted sexithiophene dication is due to a vibrational mode localised over the entire sexithiophene backbone while that of the styryl sexithiophenes is localised over the central two thiophene rings - the same area occupied by the confined defect. 
 A combined steady-state and picosecond time-resolved emission study on the styryl terthiophenes revealed that by judicious choice of the para R group in styryl terthiophenes it is possible to tune the nature of the first excited singlet state from [pi],[pi]* to charge transfer character. Charge transfer states may offer possible strategies for solar cells in which charge separation is a key step.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">oligomers</field><field name="subject">structure</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070420.150451</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The meaning of home as it becomes a place for care : the emergence of a new life stage for frail older people? : a study in the dynamics of home care for older people</field><field name="creator">Hale, Beatrice</field><field name="description">This work is a study of the day to day experiences of older people in receipt of in-home care, the experiences of their family carers, and of their careworkers, resulting in a hypothesis about the structure of the lifecycle towards the end of life, and a consideration of both structured transition and individual transitions to and within this life stage. It has taken off from Laslett&#65533;s (1989,1996) seminal work on age divisions, into Third and Fourth Ages. 
 Through an initial examination of secondary sources, I have hypothesized that the older people in this care bracket are in fact in a new life stage, between that of the independent Third Age and the dependent Fourth Age. I call this life stage the stage of 'Supported Independence'. Further references to the secondary sources, and references to the data, have supported this hypothesis, and have shown that there is a structured transition from the stage of independence to that of supported independence. 
 The value of building such a life stage lies in the ability we then have to emphasize the situation of in-home care, bringing to prominence the experiences of the three stakeholders in this care environment. 
 I have used the rites of passage concept to make known the issues involving the move from independence to dependence and those issues predominant in receiving in-home care, in being the carer at such a time, and in being the careworker within the invisibility of home. This has shown a formalized separation from the independent identity, and a prolonged stage of liminality because of an often uncertain form of service delivery. In this liminal stage also are revealed the emotions of living at home with a disability and with care, the improvisatory practices, the passivity and the assertiveness of this time of ageing. 
 By applying this concept also to the family carers, I show the movement of families into and through the caring role, the joy of caring and the difficulties of taking responsibility without authority. I have shown carers&#65533; own improvisatory practices, and their determination to maintain the care recipient at home as long as possible. 
 For the careworker, the rites of passage concept shows how she (and the careworker participants in this study are all women), can act to either maintain the liminal position of the recipients or assist in their reconnection to greater autonomy. Exploring the careworkers&#65533; own positions by means of the rites of passage concept highlights their inter-structural position between the public and private sectors, and highlights too, the care industry&#65533;s position, between that of a time managed industry and a recipient-directed industry. Whether this can be regarded as liminal depends on the philosophies of care adopted by the industry. 
 In summary, the study examines the significance of the place of care, challenging the dominant ideology that home is best, and putting forward for consideration principles of care for other models of service delivery.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">older people</field><field name="subject">frail elderly</field><field name="subject">home care</field><field name="subject">home nursing</field><field name="subject">human life cycle</field><field name="subject">psychological aspects</field><field name="subject">dependency (psychology) in old age</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070402.143208</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Lasting neuroprotection with clomethiazole following hypoxia-ischaemia-induced neurodegeneration : a mechanistic study</field><field name="creator">Clarkson, Andrew N.</field><field name="description">Subsequent to an hypoxic-ischaemic (HI)-insult a multi-faceted complex cascade of events occurs that ultimately results in cellular and neurological impairments within cortical and sub-cortical central nervous system (CNS) regions. In the present studies a modified &#65533;Levine&#65533; rat-pup model of HI (left carotid artery ligation + 1 hour global hypoxia on post-natal day (PND) 26) was employed to assess the neuroprotective properties of clomethiazole (CMZ; a &#947;-aminobutyric acid (GABA)A receptor agonist). In this study, histological and electrophysiological paradigms were used to assess the long-term neuroprotective properties of CMZ (414mg/kg/day via mini-pumps). Key enzymes involved in inflammation, namely nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and arginase, were also examined to assess other potential CMZ mechanisms. Assessments were carried out 3- and 90-days post-HI, with extensive ipsilateral CNS lesions evident at a gross histological level, at both the early and long-term stages, with CMZ significantly decreasing the lesion size at 3- and 90-days (P&lt;0.01; P&lt;0.05). Evoked field potential analyses were used to assess hippocampal CA1 neuronal activity ex vivo. Electrophysiological measurements contralateral to the occlusion revealed impaired neuronal function following HI relative to short- and long-term controls (P&lt;0.001, 3- and 14-days; P&lt;0.01, 90-days), with CMZ providing near complete protection (P&lt;0.001 at 3- and 14-days; P&lt;0.01 at 90-days). Both inducible NOS (iNOS) and arginase activities were significantly increased at 3-days (P&lt;0.01), with arginase activity remaining elevated at 90-days post-HI (P&lt;0.05) ipsilaterally. CMZ suppressed the HI-induced increase in iNOS and arginase activities (P&lt;0.001; P&lt;0.05). These data provide evidence of long-term functional neuroprotection afforded by CMZ in a model of HI-induced neurodegeneration. In addition, under conditions of HI, functional deficits were not restricted to the ipsilateral hemisphere and were due, at least in part, to changes in the activity of NOS and arginase. 
 Underlying mitochondrial dysfunction is eminently present in many neuropathological conditions. The full extent of mitochondrial dysfunction in cortical, hippocampal and cerebellar tissues was assessed following HI. Assessment of mitochondrial FAD-linked respiration at both 1- and 3-days post-HI revealed a significant decrease in activity from ipsilateral cortical and hippocampal regions (P&lt;0.001). In addition, significant changes in respiratory function were also evident in contralateral regions and cerebellum, 3-days post-HI (P&lt;0.05). Assessment of the mitochondrial electron transport chain (complexes I-V) and mitochondrial markers of integrity (citrate synthase) and oxidative stress (aconitase) confirmed ipsilateral mitochondrial impairment following HI. Complexes I, II-III, V and citrate synthase were also impaired, in contralateral regions and cerebellum, 3-days post-HI. CMZ treatment provided significant protection to all mitochondrial aspects of neuronal tissue assessed. This study provides evidence of the full extent of mitochondrial damage following an HI-insult and may contribute, in part, to the impairment seen contralaterally. In addition, protection afforded by CMZ extends to preservation of mitochondrial function and integrity. 
 Cerebral ischaemia-induced angiogenesis has been shown within and around infarcted regions and may contribute to a more favourable neurological outcome. The level of angiogenesis was examined using platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1 / CD31). CD31 immunolabelling 7-days post-HI revealed a significant increase in angiogenesis compared with non-intervention controls (P&lt;0.001). Treatment with CMZ decreased the level of angiogenesis compared to HI + saline (P&lt;0.001) back to non-intervention control levels. Conversely, N[omega]-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) treatment (5mg/kg/day) exacerbated the ischaemic lesion (P&lt;0.001) and resulted in a marked decrease in angiogenesis compared to non-intervention controls (P&lt;0.001). The extent of cerebral infarction in these studies is dependent on the level of NOS activity with CMZ increasing total NOS levels compared to HI + saline, while L-NAME halted the HI-induce increase in total NOS activity (P&lt;0.001). These results show for the first time, that angiogenesis may be used as an assessment of neurodegeneration / neuroprotection in pathologies of cerebral ischaemia and are directly correlated with changes in NOS activity. 
 These studies have therefore shown that following HI, damage also occurs contralateral to the occlusion, and is not restricted to the ipsilateral hemisphere. In addition, the neuroprotective effects of CMZ have been shown to extend out to 90-days post-HI, whereby significant protection to CA1 neuronal activity was seen. These studies also provide in vivo evidence that CMZ may also afford neuroprotection via anti-inflammatory pathways, as evidenced by a decrease in iNOS and arginase activities. Furthermore, these studies have also show evidence that angiogenesis (CD31) can be used as a diagnostic tool to assess neuroprotection / neurodegeneration.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Clomethiazole</field><field name="subject">nervous system</field><field name="subject">degeneration</field><field name="subject">anoxemia</field><field name="subject">cerebral ischemia</field><field name="subject">neuroprotective agents</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070424.120005</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The geology of central southern Fiordland : with emphasis on the cause of polybaric Cretaceous metamorphism in western New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Powell, Nicholas Garth</field><field name="description">Central southern Fiordland, New Zealand, is underlain extensively by metasediments and associated metavolcanics. These are mapped in three lithostratigraphic units, from west to east Edgecumbe Group, Cameron Group and Cumbrae Supergroup. Lower Cameron Group units lithocorrelate with Central Fiordland Belt lithological associations and with those of Fraser Complex, Westland. 
 Eastern Fiordland Belt metavolcanics and lacustrine metasediments are tectonostratigraphically unrelated to Cameron Group, from which they are separated by the Grebe Fault. They instead have affiliations with the Loch Burn Formation, Largs Volcanics, Drumduan Group and Paterson Group. These units (collectively, "Cumbrae Supergroup") represent remnants of a Triassic-Jurassic calc-alkaline arc. 
 Six deformational episodes are identified in central southern Fiordland. The earliest, D&#8321;, is obliterated by D&#8322; and M&#8322; metamorphism. D&#8323; is restricted to the Southwest Fiordland Block. D&#8324; occupied a brief interval of M&#8323; time. D&#8324; of the Central and Western Fiordland Belts corresponds to earliest deformation in Eastern Fiordland Belt metavolcanics. The Grebe Fault is a left-lateral reverse D&#8324; fault; now vertical, it previously dipped eastward. The Dusky Fault, a reactivated D&#8325; left-lateral transfer structure, accommodated the dip-slip component of displacement at low-angle normal faults during mid-Cretaceous extension. Open folds represent D&#8326;. Post-glacial scarps mark the post-D&#8326; Kilcoy and Vincent Faults. Their merged northward continuation is intersected by the tailrace tunnel of the Manapouri Hydroelectric Power Station. 
 Southwest Fiordland Block pelites were metamorphosed at 665 &#65533;C, c. 3 kbar during M&#8322;. Early M&#8323; is of contact metamorphic aspect. Late M&#8323; is distinctively polybaric: Central Fiordland Belt kyanite-garnet pelites recrystallised at c. 8.5 kbar after metamorphism in the sillimanite field at c. 3.5 kbar. Western Fiordland Orthogneiss 12 kbar granulite assemblages formed during late M&#8323;. South of the Dusky Fault, late M&#8323; is almost asymptomatic. The M&#8323; field gradient is continuous across the Grebe Fault: in the Eastern Fiordland Belt, late M&#8323; staurolite and garnet supersede chloritoid in lacustrine (meta-)sapropel-silts. 
 The Grebe Fault is an important tectonostratigraphic break; it may separate New Zealand&#65533;s Western and Eastern Provinces. Its relationship to any "Median Tectonic Zone" is unclear, as no such zone has been found in southeastern Fiordland. Cumbrae Supergroup rocks within the "Median Tectonic Zone" represent the arc that nourished the Eastern Province&#65533;s Barretts Formation, Murihiku Supergroup and Stephens Subgroup. The Cumbrae arc was &#65533;obducted&#65533; westwards during Early Cretaceous continent-arc collision. This event simultaneously halted Eastern Province volcanogenic sedimentation and tectonically buried Fiordland, imposing late M&#8323; pressure increments. Drumduan Group lawsonite is coeval. 
 Cretaceous collision induced glaciation. Late Cretaceous climatic deterioration and extensional tectonism caused icecap development. The Otago "Peneplain" is a Late Cretaceous subglacial floor. Accumulation of voluminous perennial Cretaceous ice on Earth has hitherto not been inferred. 
 Facultative psychrophily in New Zealand&#65533;s ancient endemics and their preference for dark conditions reflect passage through a hitherto-unsuspected evolutionary bottleneck: prolonged winter darkness and harsh climate of near-polar Late Cretaceous New Zealand exerted extraordinary evolutive pressures on ancestral forms after biotic links with Gondwana were severed. New Zealand&#65533;s ancient endemics are the evolutionary derivatives of a Late Cretaceous near-polar fauna.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">geology</field><field name="subject">stratigraphic geology</field><field name="subject">Cretaceous</field><field name="subject">topographic maps</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fiordland</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070424.121136</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Formulation and characterisation of nanoparticles from biocompatible microemulsions</field><field name="creator">Krauel, Karen</field><field name="description">The aims of this study were to prepare poly (ethylcyanoacrylate) (PECA) nanoparticles on the basis of different types of microemulsions, to investigate the entrapment within and release of a bioactive from these particles and to establish a set of delivery systems with varying entrapment and release characteristics, thereby giving the formulator the opportunity of a more tailor-made approach in the development of a delivery system. Furthermore the scale up of particle preparation and the possible enhancement of the immunogenic properties of PECA particles by incorporation of the adjuvant Quil A was investigated. 
 Methods: Four phase triangles were established and microemulsion samples, used as a template to prepare nanoparticles, were characterised by viscosity and conductivity measurements, polarising light microscopy, freeze fracture transmission electron microscopy (TEM), cryo field emission electron microscopy (cryo FESEM) and self-diffusion NMR to determine their microemulsion type (droplet, bicontinuous, solution type). PECA nanoparticles were prepared from different types of microemulsions by interfacial polymerisation. Particle size, polydispersity index (PI) and [zeta]-potential were measured by photon correlation spectroscopy and electrophoretic mobility respectively. Normal scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and cryo FESEM were used to visualise particles. Fluorescently labelled ovalbumin (FITC-OVA) was used as a model protein/antigen and entrapment within and release from nanoparticles was investigated. To scale up nanoparticle preparation an instrumental set-up with reactor, peristaltic pump and stirrer was used. A 2&#8311; fractional factorial study was designed to observe possible factors or their interactions that could influence particle formation under scale up conditions. For an immunological study freeze dried formulations of PECA nanoparticles, having FITC-OVA and Quil A entrapped, were prepared, and activation and uptake of formulations by murine bone marrow derived dendritic cells (DCs) and T cells in vitro were monitored. 
 Results: Results obtained from the measurements described above, for formulations from the four different phase triangles, indicated that microemulsions of w/o droplet, bicontinuous or solution type could be formed. It was possible to prepare PECA nanoparticles from all of the different types of microemulsions. Particles had an average size of 265 nm &#65533; 24, with an average PI of 0.18 &#65533; 0.05 and an average negative [zeta]-potential of -17 mV &#65533; -5. Particle size, PI and [zeta]-potential were not influenced by the type of microemulsion that was used as a polymerisation template. Entrapment and release were however influenced by the type of microemulsion and although entrapment of FITC-OVA was generally high for PECA particles, it was highest for particles prepared from a droplet type microemulsion. Entrapment could also be increased by increasing amounts of monomer. The rate of release was dependent on the amount of monomer used for polymerisation and the type of microemulsion used for particle preparation, with nanoparticles prepared from a w/o droplet type microemulsion showing the slowest release. Furthermore it was shown that particle preparation could be scaled-up with the instrumental set-up used in this study, but conditions need to be refined as the average particle size and polydispersity index were considerably larger (441 nm &#65533; 101, 0.68 &#65533; 0.14) when compared to particles prepared by the beaker-pipette method (see above). The adjuvant Quil A could efficiently be entrapped into PECA nanoparticles together with FITC-OVA. Incubation of DCs and T cells with the various formulations did, however, not result in increased uptake or activation. 
 Conclusions: PECA nanoparticles with high entrapment efficiency of antigen and adjuvant can be prepared from different types of microemulsions. Particles show different rates of entrapment and release depending on the type of microemulsion used as a polymerisation template, possibly because two different types of nanoparticles form. Nanocapsules are believed to form on the basis of droplet type microemulsions and nanospheres form on the basis of bicontinuous and solution type microemulsions. Freeze dried formulations of PECA nanoparticles, containing Quil A and FITC-OVA, were not able to induce an immune response, which might be due to charge repulsion effects between the negatively charged PECA nanoparticles and the negatively charged surface of dendritic cells. Moreover, no adjuvant effect of Quil A was apparent, perhaps caused by total encapsulation of the compound into the particle matrix with no active groups extending out displaying adjuvanticity.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">nanoparticles</field><field name="subject">biomedical materials</field><field name="subject">biocompatibility</field><field name="subject">emulsions (pharmacy)</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070424.130711</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Regulation of mouse UCP2 and UCP3 gene expression</field><field name="creator">Kim, Dongho</field><field name="description">Uncoupling protein, UCP, present in the inner mitochondrial membrane of brown adipose tissue (BAT) contributes to adaptive thermogenesis. UCP functions as a proton pore and can dissipate the proton electrochemical gradient established by the respiratory chain during fuel oxidation, and thus generates heat without producing ATP. However, the brown adipose tissue thermogenesis is not likely to be a major mechanism in controlling energy expenditure for humans because adults have only residual amounts of the tissue. 
 Two new members of the UCP family have been identified based on their high sequence homology to UCP in BAT and named UCP2 and UCP3. The original UCP was renamed UCP1. At the amino acid level, human UCP2 and UCP3 are 59% and 57% identical to UCP1, respectively. In contrast to UCP1, UCP2 is expressed in many tissues such as brown adipose tissue, white adipose tissue, muscle, spleen and macrophages. UCP3 is expressed preferentially in skeletal muscle in humans, and brown adipose tissue and skeletal muscle in rodents. Since their identification many functional studies, including transgenic animals and ectopic expression of UCP2 or UCP3 in yeast, showed uncoupling activity of UCP2 and UCP3. A number of studies have been done that show increased expression of UCP2 and UCP3 by fasting, high-fat diets and suckling of newborn mice. A common characteristic of these circumstances is an associated increase in plasma free fatty acid levels. This study aimed to investigate effects of fatty acids, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) and other transcription factors on UCP2 and UCP3 gene expression and to explore the molecular mechanism of their regulation through analysis of the promoter of the UCP2 and UCP3 genes. 
 The 3.1 kb and 3.2 kb 5&#65533;-flanking regions of the mouse UCP2 and UCP3 genes, respectively, were cloned and used to construct promoter reporter gene (firefly luciferase) plasmids. The cloned region of the UCP2 and UCP3 genes contained putative binding motifs for several transcription factors, including PPAR, myogenin, and MyoD. Luciferase assays of both constructs showed basal promoter activity with 20~190-fold induction for the UCP2 promoter and 1.3~23-fold induction for the UCP3 promoter in several transfected cell lines, including 3T3-L1, C2C12, L6, COS7 and HepG2. Oleic acid (0.3 mM) up-regulated endogenous UCP2 mRNA by 2.3-fold in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes but not in C2C12 myotubes, and UCP3 mRNA by 2.5-fold in C2C12 myotubes. Responsiveness of the cloned promoter to oleic acid reflected the tissue-specific responsiveness of their endogenous genes but with less fold induction, 1.4-fold for UCP2 promoter in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes and 1.5-fold for UCP3 promoter in C2C12 myotubes. 
 Forced expression of PPAR isotypes (PPAR&#945;, PPAR[delta] and PPAR&#947;) showed tissue and isotype-specific activation of the UCP2 promoter. UCP2 promoter activity was induced by 2-fold by PPAR&#947; in 3T3-L1 and by 2.8-fold by PPAR[delta] in C2C12. Treatment of oleic acid (0.3 mM) brought about further induction of the UCP2 promoter activity only in 3T3-L1. In contrast, all three isotypes induced activation of the UCP3 promoter in 3T3-L1, C2C12 and HepG2 cells. Treatment with oleic acid (0.3 mM) or isotype-specific agonist (10 [mu]M) resulted in further increased activity of the UCP3 promoter in 3T3-L1 and HepG2 cells. In particular, rosiglitazone (10 [mu]M) induced a 41-fold increase in UCP3 promoter activity in PPAR&#947; transfected HepG2 cells, and this induction returned to basal level by treatment with bisphenol A diglycidyl ether (BADGE) (50 [mu]M), an antagonist for PPAR&#947;. 
 In addition, UCP3 promoter activity increased up to 20-fold 4 days after induction of C2C12 myoblasts differentiation, whereas UCP2 promoter activity increased only up to 2-fold. Forced expression of myogenin and MyoD in C2C12 myoblasts to mimic differentiation, induced UCP3 promoter activity in an additive manner, consistent with UCP3 being regulated by muscle differentiation. 
 In the present study, it has been shown that UCP2 and UCP3 genes are regulated differently by fatty acids. The tissue-type dependence in regulation of endogenous UCP2 and UCP3 paralleled the cell type-specific effect of oleic acid on the promoter-reporter constructs, suggesting that fatty acid effects are at the transcriptional level. UCP2 and UCP3 promoters showed differences in their response to PPARs. Mediation of the fatty acid effect through PPARs has been also demonstrated, but direct binding of PPARs and particular regulatory motifs on the cloned promoter region have not yet been investigated.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">energy metabolism</field><field name="subject">brown adipose tissue</field><field name="subject">fatty acids</field><field name="subject">metabolism</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070424.131549</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effect of homocysteine lowering vitamins on cognitive performance in older people : a randomised controlled trial</field><field name="creator">McMahon, Jennifer A.</field><field name="description">Background: Inverse associations have been reported between homocysteine concentrations and poor cognitive performance in several cross-sectional studies of healthy elderly subjects. Folate supplementation with or without vitamins B-12 and B-6 is an effective means of lowering homocysteine concentrations. Mood disturbances, from mild mood changes to clinical depression, are common in older populations. Several studies have shown that depressed people have lower levels of folate and vitamin B-12 and higher levels of homocysteine than non-depressed people. Improvement of mood has been reported in depressed people following supplementation with folic acid. Clinical trials are required to determine if lowering homocysteine concentration with vitamins improves cognitive function and/or mood in healthy elderly participants. 
 Objective: The primary aim of this research project was to carry-out a 2 year randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to determine if a supplement containing folate (1mg L-Mefolinic acid), vitamin B-12 (500(mu)g) and vitamin B-6 (10mg) improves scores or prevents decline on tests of cognition in a group of healthy older people ([greater than or equal to]&#818; 65 years) with a plasma homocysteine concentration [greater than or equal to]&#818;13 (mu)mol/L. A second aim of this study was to determine if homocysteine lowering vitamins improved scores on tests of mood in this group. 
 Methods: Four hundred and sixty-five individuals, aged 65 and over, were recruited from Dunedin and surrounds, and asked to attend a screening clinic and provide a fasting blood sample. Two-hundred and seventy-six volunteers with a plasma homocysteine concentration [greater than or equal to]13(mu)mol/L were randomised to take either a combination of 1mg L-Mefolinic acid, 500(mu)g vitamin B-12 and 10mg vitamin B-6 or placebo for 2 years. A battery of cognitive tests and indices of mood was administered at baseline, one year, and two years. A fasting blood sample was collected at baseline and every six months thereafter. 
 Results: From baseline to 6 months of the intervention, homocysteine concentrations decreased by 37.5%, from 16.7 to 10.5 (mu)mol/L in the vitamin supplemented group and then plateaued. In the vitamin supplemented group there was a 181% increase in red blood cell folate concentration from a mean of 977 to 2752 nmol/L, and a 90.1% increase in plasma vitamin B-12 (from a mean 283 to 538 (mu)mol/L) over the study period of two years. 
 In the vitamin supplemented group there was a trend to poorer performance on almost all tests of cognition compared to placebo group. The vitamin group was 8% slower on Part B of the Reitan Trail Making Test, a test of speeded attention, mental tracking, visual search and mental flexibility (p=0.009). The vitamin group scored significantly lower on tests of short-term recall, Weschler Paragraphs (p=0.03) after 2 years, and the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test ((p=0.04) after one year, than the placebo group. There was no difference in mood score by treatment in this largely non-depressed group. 
 Conclusion: These results suggest a detrimental effect of high dose homocysteine lowering vitamin supplements on cognitive function in healthy older people. These results need to be confirmed in other randomised controlled trials.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cognition</field><field name="subject">mood (psychology)</field><field name="subject">physiological aspects</field><field name="subject">folic acid</field><field name="subject">vitamin B12</field><field name="subject">vitamin B6</field><field name="subject">homocysteine</field><field name="subject">older people</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070426.154857</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Synthetic approaches to the angucycline antibiotics</field><field name="creator">Osman, Hasnah</field><field name="description">The stereoselective synthesis of urdamycinone B (17) was achieved in a 21% overall yield from C-glycosyl-naphthoquinone 197. The key reaction was the Diels-Alder cycloaddition reaction of 197 and siloxydiene (&#65533;)-117 promoted by a chiral Lewis acid derived from (S)-3,3&#65533;-diphenyl-1,1&#65533;-binaphthalene-2,2&#65533;-diol (291), BH&#8323;.THF and acetic acid. An effective kinetic resolution of (&#65533;)-117 occurred. Four cycloadducts 199a-d were formed in a ratio between 84:8:2:6 and 70:9:2:19. Aromatisation of the mixture by treatment with 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU) gave 200a and 200b in 4:1 ratio. A sequence of reactions involving deacetylation, conversion of a phenyldimethylsilyl group into a hydroxyl group and photooxidation gave a 4:1 mixture of urdamycinone B (17) and its C-3 epimer (154). Separation of these products was achieved by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). 
 The C-glycosyl donor, 1,3,4-tri-O-acetyl-2,6-dideoxy-D-glucopyranose (204), was synthesised from readily accessible tri-O-acetyl-D-glucal (237) using two approaches. The first involved a sequence of deacetylation, tosylation, lithium aluminium hydride (LiAlH&#8324;) reduction and acetylation to give di-O-acetyl-6-deoxy-D-glucal (242). The triphenylphosphine hydrogen bromide (TPPHBr) catalysed addition of acetic acid to 242 gave 204 in overall yields ranging from 0 to 32%. The step involving the reduction of the tosylate intermediate was the cause of the variable yields. 
 The alternative synthesis started with the TPPHBr catalysed addition of benzyl alcohol to 237. Subsequent deacetylation, tosylation and reduction with LiAlH&#8324; gave benzyl 2,6-dideoxy-D-glucopyranoside (250). Acetylation and hydrogenolytic debenzylation gave 3,4-di-O-acetyl-2,6-dideoxy-D-glucopyranose (247). Acetylation gave 204 in 40% overall yield. 
 A third approach to 204 involved selective tosylation of methyl &#945;-D-mannopyranoside (258) and subsequent treatment with 2,2-dimethoxypropane under acidic conditions to give acetonide 255. LiAlH&#8324; reduction of the tosylate gave methyl 6-deoxy-2,3-O-isopropylidene-&#945;-D-mannopyranoside (256). Acidic hydrolysis of 256 and subsequent acetylation afforded 1,2,3,4-tetra-O-acetyl-6-deoxy-&#945;-D-mannopyranoside (260). Treatment of 260 with hydrogen bromide in acetic acid and subsequent reductive elimination with a zinc-copper couple gave 242. The addition of acetic acid catalysed by TPPHBr afforded 204 in 18% overall yield. 
 The final synthesis of 204 started with thiophenyl 2,3,4,6-tetra-O-acetyl-&#945;-D-mannopyranoside (269). A sequence of deacetylation, tosylation and LiAlH&#8324; reduction gave thiophenyl 2,3-O-isopropylidene-6-deoxy-&#945;-D-mannopyranoside (274). The structure of 274 was confirmed from a single crystal X-ray diffraction study. Hydrolysis of the isopropylidene group of 274 and subsequent acetylation afforded thiophenyl 6-deoxy-2,3,4-tri-O-acetyl-&#945;-D-mannopyrannoside (282). Treatment of 282 with iodine monobromide and subsequent reductive elimination with zinc-copper couple gave 242. The TPPHBr catalysed addition of acetic acid to 242 afforded 204 in 19% overall yield. 
 Differentially protected C-glycosyl donor, 1,3-di-O-acetyl-4-O-benzyl-2,6-dideoxy-D-mannopyranose (265), was synthesised from 274. The benzylation of 274 gave thiophenyl 6-deoxy-2,3-O-isopropylidene-4-O-benzyl-&#945;-D-mannopyranoside (276). Acidic hydrolysis followed by acetylation afforded thiophenyl 6-deoxy-1,2-di-O-acetyl-4-O-benzyl-&#945;-D-mannopyranoside (278) which, upon bromination by iodine monobromide, gave thiophenyl 6-deoxy-1,2-di-O-acetyl-4-O-benzyl-&#945;-D-mannopyranosyl bromide (279). The reductive elimination of 279 with zinc-copper couple gave 3-O-acetyl-4-O-benzyl-6-deoxy-D-glycal (264). The TPPHBr catalysed addition of acetic acid to 264 afforded 1,3-di-O-acetyl-4-O-benzyl-2,6-dideoxy-D-mannopyranose (265) in 16% overall yield from 274. The instabillity of bromide 279 affected the yield of 265. 
 A C-glycosylation study of 2-naphthol 227 and 1,4-dimethoxy-5-hydroxynaphthalene (205) with 2-deoxy-glycosyl acetates was undertaken. Boron trifluoride diethyl etherate (BF&#8323;.Et&#8322;O) and scandium triflate [Sc(OTf)&#8323;] proved effective promoters. For example, the glycosylation reaction of donor 265 and 227, promoted by 0.5 equivalents of Sc(OTf)&#8323;, afforded C-glycoside 2-hydroxy-1-[3&#65533;-O-acetyl-4&#65533;-O-benzyl-2,6-dideoxy-&#946;-D-manno-hexopyranosyl]-naphthalene (289) in 85% yield.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">antibiotics</field><field name="subject">synthesis</field><field name="subject">glycosides</field><field name="subject">Diels-Alder reaction</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070426.160307</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Food security in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Parnell, Winsome R.</field><field name="description">There was growing concern in New Zealand in the 1990&#65533;s that Food Security: access by all people at all times to enough food for an active healthy life, was not being achieved, despite an abundant food supply. A study of a convenience sample of 40 families with children (58 adults and 92 children) whose sole income was a government welfare benefit was undertaken. Two-thirds of these households regularly relied on a limited variety of food; one-half did not have a sufficient amount of food because of lack of money and outstanding debts. Over the previous year two-thirds had sourced food from a food bank and one-third had been gifted food from friends or relatives. Women&#65533;s intakes were compromised regularly but not children&#65533;s. All of the women experienced worry about feeding their household. One-fifth were overweight and over 40% obese despite low reported daily energy intakes (median (SE) 5.7 (0.5) MJ) compared to national data. Six repeated 24-hour diet recalls collected randomly over a two-week period enabled calculation of usual daily intake and the prevalence of inadequate intake for eight micronutrients which were disturbingly high. The children&#65533;s growth patterns compared favourably with US population percentiles. 
 The National Nutrition Survey (NNS97) allowed the adaption of eight questions--developed by Reid using qualitative methods--to eight indicator statements about food security to be addressed by each participant on behalf of them or their household. Prevalence was significantly higher (p&lt;0.05) for females compared to males for the majority of indicator statements among New Zealand European and Others (NZEO) and Maori. NZEO reported the most food security; Pacific people reported the least and Maori fell between the two. There was a significant increasing linear trend of food security with age (p&lt;0.001) after adjusting for gender. 
 Rasch analysis was performed on 1868 households where participants reported some food insecurity. The responses were ranked according to the proportion and ordering of their positive responses to eight indices of food security, achieving reliability (Cronbach&#65533;s Alpha) close to the conventionally accepted level of 0.7. The eight indices were ranked on the same scale; the minimum score -1.66 was achieved by the index &#65533;use special food grants/banks&#65533; (the index least reported and most severe) and the maximum score 1.86 was achieved by the index &#65533;variety of foods eaten limited&#65533; (the index most reported and least severe). 
 Categories of food security were assigned using scale cut points: &#65533;fully/almost fully food secure&#65533;; &#65533;moderate food security&#65533;; &#65533;low food security&#65533;. Category status was associated with consumption of recommended number of daily serves of fruit, vegetables, fruits and vegetables, consumption of leaner meats, fatty meats and daily serves of bread. By ANOVA and controlling for sex, ethnicity, Index of Deprivation, urban/rural location, age, level of education, income, and household size, category of household food security was associated with the level of daily intake of total fat, saturated, monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fat, cholesterol, glucose, fructose, lactose, vitamin B6, vitamin B12, and vitamin C. Dietary data were from the primary 24-hour diet recall of respondents. Participants in the fully/almost fully food secure category of households had a mean BMI of 28.7 compared to those moderately secure (29.2) and of low food security (29.5) (p=0.015 for difference among categories). 
 In the Children&#65533;s Nutrition Survey 2002 (CNS02) data set, the same eight indices were used and food insecurity was experienced significantly more often by children in the largest households, those in the most deprived areas of residence (NZDep01 Quintile) and those of Pacific and Maori ethnicity compared to NZEO children. Rasch analysis was performed on responses for 1561 households with children which reported some food insecurity. Subject reliability was close to 0.7 (the conventionally acceptable level). The distribution of the eight indices on the Rasch scale was similar to that observed among the NNS97 households and almost identical to the sub-set of households with children, from that dataset. Categories of food security status were assigned as in the NN5S97 and they predicted daily nutrient intake levels of children: total sugars, lactose, vitamm A, &#946;-carotene, vitamin B12 and calcium. A more rigorous assigning of categories at the low/moderate scale cut-off, resulted in a further association with level of intake of glucose, fructose and folate. Mean BMI across categories of food security did not differ. 
 Collectively these data provide unequivocal evidence that food insecurity exists in New Zealand, that it can be quantified and associated with nutrition outcomes. It has a negative impact on the nutrient intakes of both adults and children and a negative impact on the body weight status of adults. 
 These data have implications for nutrition and health professionals and policy makers in New Zealand. They also add to the world-wide body of knowledge of the experience of, and the measurement and predictive potential of food security in populations where the food supply appears plentiful.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">nutrition</field><field name="subject">low-income consumers</field><field name="subject">poor</field><field name="subject">household surveys</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070426.162526</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Coherent multiwavelength sources for tropospheric aerosol lidar</field><field name="creator">Rawle, Christopher B.</field><field name="description">The monitoring and study of the earth&#65533;s atmosphere is becoming an increasingly important task given the current uncertainties in climate prediction. Areas where lidar has been used to further understanding of the atmosphere include monitoring of greenhouse gases, global warming, stratospheric ozone depletion, photochemical smog and aerosol photochemistry. However, the potentially severe long term effects of anthropogenic aerosols on earth&#65533;s biosphere are poorly understood. This project seeks to apply state of the art laser technology to develop an innovative multiwavelength lidar system capable of providing new information and new insights into the field of tropospheric aerosol lidar. 
 Several novel tunable laser and laser-like sources have been investigated and developed for the purpose of tropospheric aerosol lidar at The National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research (Niwa), Central Otago. Multiwavelength operation in the visible and near infrared portion of the spectrum has been emphasised with the sources developed collectively spanning the wavelength interval of 400-1369 nm. The laser sources investigated were the LiF:F2+ colour centre, Titanium Sapphire (Ti:sapphire) and barium nitrate Raman lasers. In addition to the laser sources, the &#946;-barium borate optical parametric oscillator (BBO OPO) was characterised. For each of the sources, lidar relevant aspects were studied. The results recorded include conversion efficiency with respect to the pump source, linewidth and tuning characteristics, beam quality, temporal behaviour, and device reliability and ruggedness. 
 It was found that the LiF:F2+ laser offered significantly lower threshold, broader tuning and higher output pulse energies than the Ti:sapphire laser in the 900-1000 nm region. The high optical gain of the LiF:F2+ medium facilitated cavity optical alignment and operation of the system. The high gain also resulted in temporal behaviour well suited to the existing Niwa lidar detection scheme. When using a 5 ns pump source, amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) was found to limit the laser tuning range and efficiency. 
 The barium nitrate Raman laser was based on a simple linear cavity arrangement which resulted in a compact and robust device with no moving components. The stimulated Raman scattering process offers relatively narrow linewidth laser operation at the first and second Stokes wavelengths of 1197 nm and 1369 nm respectively. This laser offered efficient operation once the high operation threshold was reached. Second harmonic generation was used to extend the number of potential lidar transmitter lines produced. The barium nitrate Raman laser possessed high beam divergence and a maximum of three discrete transmitter wavelengths. 
 The BBO OPO used a type I collinear signal resonant configuration. A plane-plane cavity configuration with pump reflection was found to provide simplicity of design, low threshold, highly efficient operation and output pointing stability. The BBO OPO signal wavelength could be tuned over the wavelength interval of 400-700 nm. The disadvantage of the plane cavity was high output beam divergence. However, this was successfully brought within the required limits through the use of a 40 mm long cavity in conjunction with an expanding and collimating telescope. 
 As a result of the study, a Tunable lidar Transmitter (TLT) system based on the BBO OPO was designed and constructed at the Physics Department. The TLT was computer-controlled using custom written software and constructed in a self contained modular manner with all required mechanical, electrical and optical components. A user manual was also written to accompany the TLT. The TLT was installed at Niwa and was successfully used to gather preliminary multiwavelength lidar data. 
 The TLT BBO OPO threshold occurred for a pump energy of 5.2 mJ (10.6 MW/cm2) and had a maximum slope efficiency of 53%. Signal efficiency varied from 24-41-35% over the intervals of 410-500-600 nm. A maximum signal energy of 21 mJ was obtained for a signal wavelength of 492 nm when using the maximum available pump energy of 42 mJ. OPO signal linewidth varied from 0.1-1-8 nm over the signal wavelength intervals of 400-600-700 nm. The associated OPO finesse varied between 370 and 100 as the signal wavelength was tuned over the wavelength interval of 400-600 nm. The temporal behaviour of the BBO OPO was a slowly varying function of pump energy and closely followed the temporal behaviour of the pump laser, making it well suited to the existing Italian lidar detection and timing scheme.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">optical radar</field><field name="subject">environmental aspects</field><field name="subject">tropospheric aerosols</field><field name="subject">optical properties</field><field name="subject">wavelength division multiplexing</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070427.114533</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Post-mortem personalisation : an ethnographic study of funeral directors in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Schafer, Cyril Timo</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the personalisation of Pakeha (European) post-mortem practices in New Zealand. While much of the discourse surrounding funerary and disposal processes maintains that contemporary practices demonstrate a &#65533;denial&#65533; of death and funeral director esurience, funeral directors themselves have argued that the austere Anglophone approach to death has been superseded by personalised practices. This transformation has become particularly evident in the last two decades and emphasises a historic shift to funeral services that encompass the heterogeneity of late-modern individuals. The aim of this thesis, however, is not to recapitulate funeral director rhetoric or reiterate the criticisms levelled at the industry, but to critically examine the implications and manifestations of personalisation, and explore the funeral directors&#65533; role in the provision of contemporary funeral services. In addition to archival research, this ethnographic endeavour includes in-depth interviews with funeral directors (and related occupational groups) and an extended period of participant observation. The theoretical issues explored in this thesis are grounded in this ethnographic data. 
 This study reveals that personalisation is integrally linked to constructions of grief, the pastoral role of funeral directors, and Foucault&#65533;s concept of bio-power. Funeral director participants asseverated that funeral practices had &#65533;evolved&#65533; to effect the &#65533;healthy&#65533; resolution of grief. Personalised funerals represented a re-alignment of &#65533;natural&#65533; human needs and cultural practices, and funeral director rhetoric amalgamated essentialist interpretations of grief with personalised memories and continuing bonds (Klass and Walter 2001). Funeral directors explicitly linked personalisation to secularisation, emphasising the perceived lack of &#65533;guidance&#65533; and &#65533;care&#65533; in contemporary society. Although &#65533;impersonal&#65533; religious funerals provided funeral specialists with an important point of departure, many funeral directors emphasised the pastoral dimension of contemporary funeral directing. This dimension constitutes a key component of the funeral directors&#65533; role and permeated all facets of funeral service - particularly the increasing range of after-care funeral options. 
 Although the funeral director rhetoric emphasises the democratisation of funeral practices and the primacy of individuality, an examination of the discourse reveals that this personalisation also demonstrates the normalising technologies integral to Foucault&#65533;s concept of &#65533;pastoral power&#65533;. I argue that funeral directors play a significant role in articulating the boundaries of &#65533;appropriate&#65533; funeral behaviour by accentuating the importance of &#65533;authenticity&#65533;, &#65533;dignity&#65533; and &#65533;healthy grief&#65533;. These concepts underline the expertise of funeral directors, define the acceptable parameters of post-mortem practices, and reify the integral involvement of funeral directors in the construction process. The specific subjectivity promoted by funeral directors constitute individuals that are not only &#65533;honest&#65533; and &#65533;real&#65533;, but recognise the &#65533;need&#65533; for a funeral service, emotional expression, and memorialisation. These individuals similarly realise the importance of integrating the deceased into their own biographies, while acknowledging the significance of guidance and control. This subjectivity clearly legitimises the role of the contemporary New Zealand funeral director. This thesis illustrates, therefore, that funeral directors play a salient role in articulating bio-power within New Zealand society, and that this endeavour is integrally linked to the occupations&#65533; continuing pursuit of professional identity.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">undertakers and undertaking</field><field name="subject">social aspects</field><field name="subject">funeral rites and ceremonies</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070427.115528</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Hydrated complexes in the earth&#65533;s atmosphere</field><field name="creator">Schofield, Daniel Paul</field><field name="description">The interaction between sunlight and our atmosphere is one of the most fundamental processes affecting weather and climate. The majority of the Sun&#65533;s radiation is produced in the ultraviolet, visible and near-infrared regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. These spectral regions correspond to the energies of vibrational overtone and electronic transitions. The composition of our atmosphere is complex, and many trace species have a large influence on its chemistry and dynamics. Hydrogen bound hydrated complexes are trace species that could play an important role in the Earth&#65533;s atmosphere. However, before this role can be quantified, spectral identification and characterisation of these complexes is essential. 
 We have developed vibrational local mode Hamiltonians to simulate the absorption spectra of hydrated complexes. To test the approximations made in the vibrational model, we have peformed calculations on the diatomics OH, HF and CO, which can be considered to act as pure local modes. When highly correlated ab initio methods and large basis sets are used to calculate the potential energy and dipole moment curve, the simulated vibrational transitions of the diatomics are in excellent agreement with experiment. 
 We have derived approximate vibrational Hamiltonians which describe the OH-stretching and HOH-bending modes of vibration in the complexes H&#8322;O&#65533;H&#8322;O, H&#8322;O&#65533;HO&#8322; and H&#8322;O&#65533;HO. The calculated spectrum of H&#8322;O&#65533;H&#8322;O has been used to assess its atmospheric importance, and to succesfully guide experimental efforts to detect H&#8322;O&#65533;H&#8322;O in the laboratory and the Earth&#65533;s atmosphere. The calculated transition energies and intensities of H&#8322;O&#65533;H&#8322;O and H&#8322;O&#65533;HO are in good agreement with experimental matrix isolation and gas-phase studies. 
 To investigate the effect of low frequency modes on OH-stretching overtone spectra we have simulated the spectrum of HOONO. We have derived a Hamiltonian that couples the NOOH-torsional mode to the high frequency OH-stretching and OOH-bending modes. The simulated spectrum is in good agreement with the experimentally observed spectrum. We find that the OH-stretching spectra are perturbed strongly only if the barrier to torsion is low. 
 We have also investigated changes in the electronic spectrum of hydrated complexes and the corresponding parent monomers. Upon complex formation, the lowest-lying electronic transition in the hydroxyl radical is strongly redshifted outside the region of monomeric absorption.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">hydrates</field><field name="subject">complex compounds</field><field name="subject">atmospheric chemistry</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070427.120933</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Spectroscopic investigation and quantitation of polymorphism and crystallinity of pharmaceutical compounds</field><field name="creator">Strachan, Clare</field><field name="description">Spectroscopy is increasingly used to investigate and monitor the solid state forms of pharmaceutical materials and products. Spectroscopy&#65533;s speed, nondestructive sampling, compatibility with fibre optics and safety also make it attractive for in-line monitoring. 
 In this thesis, the spectroscopic techniques Fourier transform Raman spectroscopy, terahertz pulsed spectroscopy and second harmonic generation were used to characterise and quantify polymorphism and crystallinity of pharmaceutical compounds. Where possible, the multivariate analysis technique partial least squares was used for quantitative analysis. Fourier transform Raman spectroscopy detects polarisability changes mainly associated with molecular vibrations. Terahertz pulsed spectroscopy is a new spectroscopic technique that operates between the infrared and microwave regions of the electromagnetic spectrum and detects dipole moment changes mainly associated with crystalline phonon vibrations in the solid state. Second harmonic generation is a nonlinear optical phenomenon that depends on the dipole moment in crystals and crystal symmetry. 
 Several materials capable of existing in different solid state forms were used. FT-Raman spectroscopy was able to differentiate carbamazepine forms I and III, enalapril maleate forms I and II and &#947;-crystalline and amorphous indomethacin. Combined with partial least squares the technique could quantify binary mixtures of CBZ forms I and III with a limit of detection as low as 1%, and mixtures of enalapril maleate with a limit of detection of as low as 2%. 
 Terahertz pulsed spectroscopy obtained very different spectra for carbamazepine forms I and III, enalapril maleate forms I and II, &#947;-crystalline and amorphous indomethacin, crystalline and supercooled thermotropic liquid crystalline fenoprofen calcium, three forms of lactose, and five forms of sulphathiazole. At present the modes in the spectra cannot be attributed to specific phonon modes. Quantitation of binary mixtures of different forms of a compound using partial least squares analysis usually resulted in a limit of detection of about 1%. 
 Second harmonic generation was used to quantify binary mixtures of different forms of enalapril maleate and lactose, as well as binary mixtures of enalapril maleate form II and polyvinylpyrrolidone. A quantitative relationship was present for each of the mixtures, however the limits of detection were usually above 10%. The high value is probably due to the machine being a prototype and univariate analysis associated with a single output variable. Future improvements to the apparatus and measurement parameters are likely to reduce the limits of detection.

An experimental infection model in sheep was developed as a prelude to the testing of new vaccines and the development of improved diagnostic assays for Johne&#65533;s disease. The final challenge model developed used four doses of 10&#8313; viable organisms given at two to three day intervals. Gross and microscopic lesions were found in a high proportion of sheep (80%) at ten months post challenge. There was considerable variation in immune responses from animals challenged with different strains of M. paratuberculosis. Sheep challenged with a low passage laboratory culture of strain (W) M. paratuberculosis, produced strong lymphocyte transformation responses and Interferon gamma (IFN-&#947;) production at two months post challenge. Subsequent necropsy and culture from intestinal tissues showed only a low level of infection (25%). In comparison a primary tissue isolate of M. paratuberculosis (JD3) resulted in higher (60-90%) infection rates in orally challenged animals. The immune profile from these animals showed very little reactivity for the first three months post challenge, after which IFN-&#947; production could be detected. Antibody production and lymphocyte transformation response could not be measured until at least seven months post challenge. Sheep challenged with the primary tissue isolate instilled directly into the tonsil resulted in equivalent levels of Johne&#65533;s disease to those obtained with oral challenge. However, intratonsillar challenge resulted in higher levels of immune reactivity than oral challenge. 
 The proprietary Johne&#65533;s vaccines; NeoparsecTM and GudairTM and an Aqueous vaccine were tested in sheep. The immunological reactions of the sheep to these vaccines showed some variations between the two separate studies, with the NeoparasecTM and GudairTM vaccines evoking high levels of CMI and humoral reactivity within two months of vaccination. Detailed immunological examination of gut associated lymphoid tissues were carried out on subgroups of animals that were either vaccinated or non-vaccinated and went on to develop disease or were immune to experimental challenge. The results showed that the diseased animals examined had multibacillary lesions and strong CMI and humoral responses. There were decreased proportions of CD4&#8314;, CD8&#8314; and CD25&#8314; T cells in peripheral blood and gut associated lymphatics of diseased animals compared with the immune or unchallenged subgroups. Profiles from the immune subgroups showed a stronger lymphocyte transformation response than case matched diseased animals. Tissues from immune animals showed increased proportions of B cells above those seen in diseased or unchallenged animals. This study has resulted in the development of a robust experimental sheep model in which Johne&#65533;s disease occurs in a high proportion of challenged animals. Critical time points for the establishment of infection or disease have been determined. It can be used in the future to evaluate protective efficacy of vaccines or to critically chart immunological profiles that are associated with infection, disease or protective immunity. Considerable research is needed to develop improved diagnostic tests to identify patterns of immunity during the early stages of infection or while the animal has subclinical disease.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">sheep</field><field name="subject">immunology</field><field name="subject">tuberculosis in animals</field><field name="subject">immunological aspects</field><field name="subject">Mycobacterium paratuberculosis</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070427.142318</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Direct selection by colour for visual encoding</field><field name="creator">Vierck, Esther</field><field name="description">The goal of this thesis was to investigate the role of colour in visual selective attention. Previous experiments exploring this topic in tasks where location varied led to mixed results. Some studies only found evidence of colour as a guide to a specific location where selection then takes place (e.g., Nissen, 1985). Others reported an effect, but could not decide clearly if the benefit was due to direct selection of colour in perception (e.g., Humphreys, 1981). One major contributor to the inconsistencies of findings seems to be the confounding of colour and location in these tasks. For that reason the initial paradigm used here was a rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) task. Previous studies using similar paradigms have found no evidence for direct selection by colour (Poder, 2001; Shih &amp; Sperling, 1996), but in these studies advance colour information was of limited usefulness because it only reduced the set of candidate stimuli by half. To assess an effect of colour in selection similar to the one associated with location, in all experiments reported here valid colour information led to only one item, as is typical in location cuing tasks. 
 The first RSVP experiment explored whether colour certainty improved performance over a colour uncertainty condition. Colour was the defining feature of the target participants had to discriminate. In one condition the target colour was certain; in the other it could be one of two colours. Performance was improved when participants could focus on one colour. Further experiments used colour not as a defining feature of the target but as additional information presented in the form of cues, similar to the typical use of location cues. The participants&#65533; task was to discriminate whether a target letter within the RSVP sequence appeared in its upper or lower case version, and an advance cue indicated the colour in which the target letter was most likely to occur. An accuracy benefit of valid colour information was found, supporting the hypothesis that colour cuing allows the direct selection of objects for further perceptual processing. In addition, an effect of invalid colour cues was also observed. Subsequent experiments investigated possible factors influencing the colour cuing effect. Together, task requirements and properties of the stimulus set were shown to have an influence on the effect size, whereas an increase in perceptual load had no impact. Furthermore, the colour cuing effect seems to be due partially to both automatic and strategic processes. In all these experimental variations, benefits of colour cuing remained, indicating that the effect is very robust. Colour cuing effects were also found in a design where location could vary, extending the previous findings from selection in the time domain to selection in space. The two last experiments investigated whether advance colour knowledge would also lead to a performance benefit in single item tasks. No effect of colour cuing was found, indicating that colour information is only helpful in multiple item displays when a selection of one target stimulus among distractor items is necessary.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">colour</field><field name="subject">visual perception</field><field name="subject">visual pathways</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070427.145655</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Biochemistry of ovine bone and morphogenetic proteins and receptors</field><field name="creator">Mace, Peter</field><field name="description">The transforming growth factor (TGF)-&#946; superfamily mediates a wide range of differentiation and developmental processes across many genera. GDF9 and BMP15 are expressed exclusively in the mammalian ovary and are the only TGF-&#946; ligands that lack the conserved cysteine residue used for dimerisation. As a platform for studying the interactions between GDF9 and BMP15 and their receptors, BMPRII and BMPRIb, a variety of strategies were attempted to produce soluble and active proteins from recombinant systems. Both ligands and receptors showed a tendency to form insoluble aggregates when expressed in prokaryotic systems; however after extensive screening, quantities of biologically active GDF9 were produced using in vitro refolding. When expressed alone, either containing a histidine tag or as an untagged protein, the BMPRII ectodomain was deposited as insoluble inclusion bodies. This protein, subjected to in vitro refolding procedures, exhibited multiple species following anion exchange chromatography and size exclusion chromatography, as visualised on native PAGE. Separation of these species could be achieved using a MonoP matrix. One of these separated fractions, representing about 5% of the starting material, was amenable to crystallisation, and furthermore exhibited activity in a rat granulosa cell thymidine incorporation assay. Two different crystals forms of the extracellular domain of BMPRII were grown from the same protein batch under similar crystallisation conditions. Notably, the tetragonal form that grew more slowly possessed several disordered finger regions, while electron density for the entire molecule was clear in the orthorhombic form. The hydrophobic core of the ligand binding surface of BMPRII , as seen in both structures, resembles that of ActRII bound to BMP2. The A-loop of BMPRII, which is involved in ligand binding, lies in two different conformations in the two structures of BMPRII, mediated by a rearrangement in disulfide Cys94-Cys117. It is proposed here that the tetragonal form represents the ligand-bound receptor structure. Although the majority of the hydrophobic binding surface is shared with ActRII(b), it is likely that His87 and Tyr40 are unique residues that confer specificity in BMPRII ligand binding.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cattle</field><field name="subject">molecular genetics</field><field name="subject">transforming growth factors</field><field name="subject">bone morphogenetic proteins</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070508.133410</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Potential causes of the delayed neural damage observed post-stroke &amp; the effects of epigallocatechin gallate administration</field><field name="creator">Rahman, Rosanna</field><field name="description">Stroke is the 3rd leading cause of death and the leading cause of major disability worldwide. Currently, there are no neuroprotective drugs approved for the acute treatment of ischaemic stroke. The vast majority of stroke therapeutics failed in clinical trials due to toxic side effects and/or a clinically irrelevant therapeutic window. This thesis is focused on exploiting the delayed neurodegeneration that occurs in the compromised penumbra, as these cells may be capable of being saved by therapeutic intervention in a clinically obtainable window. In order to investigate the ischaemic cascade and be able to draw conclusions that are applicable to humans, the international gold standard animal model for cerebral ischaemia, the filament insertion middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model, was established at the University of Otago. This model was validated under new laboratory conditions and employed adult male Sprague Dawley rats. After testing multiple occlusion lengths, it was concluded that a 2hr ischaemic period was sufficient to produce a consistent infarct of optimal size. It has been well documented that neuroinflammation contributes to much of the delayed progression of neural injury post-stroke. Therefore, the catechin (-)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), which is an anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant and free-radical scavenging agent was investigated in the MCAO model of stroke. 50mg/kg i.p. of EGCG or saline was administered immediately post-MCAO and animals were sacrificed at 72hr post-filament insertion. The results confirmed that treatment with EGCG was neuroprotective and non-toxic. However, EGCG also induced an over 50% increase in the risk of haemorrhagic conversions. The anti-platelet effects of EGCG and lack of toxicity suggests that the catechin may prove to be an efficacious prophylactic for stroke. The contrary findings for EGCG treatment led to the re-evaluation of the neuroinflammatory pathway for alternate mechanisms to target therapeutic interventions. 
 The temporal profile of the primary inducible enzymes nitric oxide synthase (NOS), cyclooxygenase (COX) and arginase (and their isoforms) were quantified 0, 3 and 7 days post-stroke. In both hemispheres, total NOS activity exhibited a significant and sustained up-regulation to 7 days post-occlusion. In the ipsilateral hemisphere at least half of the total increase was accounted for by inducible NOS (iNOS) expression. Arginase, which competes with NOS for L-arginine, demonstrated a delayed but significant increase in activity by day 7 in the infarcted hemisphere, thereby correlating well with the downward slope of NOS activity (illustrating the switch in the conversion pathway). COX activity was observably increased in the ipsilateral hemisphere, but the up-regulation did not reach significance by day 7. Alternately, the contralateral hemisphere displayed a significant decrease in activity by day 3. These results give conclusive evidence that the contralateral hemisphere is NOT an appropriate internal control and imply that NOS and COX inhibitors may prove to be efficacious for a much longer therapeutic window than current treatments. However, the delayed induction of COX activity may also indicate that this enzyme has a finite therapeutic window, as it may also stimulate remodelling of surviving neural networks. The prolonged up-regulation of inflammatory mediators implies that there may be an induction of an autoimmune component to the response. Therefore, the thymus (T) lymphocyte activation was quantified up to 14 days post-stroke. Cluster of differentiation (CD) 3&#8314; T lymphocytes (equally contributed to by CD4&#8314; and CD8&#8314; T cells) exhibited a significant and sustained up-regulation in the infarcted region from day 3 up to at least day 14 post-ischaemia. Quantitative analysis of all cells present post-stroke determined that immune cells make up an average of 73% of all cells present in the 'peak' ischaemic areas. The CD4&#8314; T helper cell response was delineated by double immunohistochemical labelling. Interferon-&#947; positively labelled with CD4&#8314; T cells at days 3, 7 and 14 post-insult detailing a Th1-driven pro-inflammatory response. This evidence indicates that the autoimmune response is critical post-ischaemia and that it may be highly susceptible to modification by anti-inflammatory therapeutic intervention. 
 The primary downstream effect of the pro-inflammatory/immune cascade is apoptosis. The main organelle responsible for the 'go, no go' response to apoptotic factors is the mitochondria. In order to distinguish whether mitochondrial dysfunction was initiated shortly after ischaemia induction or if it was delayed, like the inflammatory/immune response, to a clinically relevant window, the temporal profile of mitochondrial complex inactivation was studied. It was found that mitochondrial membrane viability was impaired by day 3, followed by a significant decrease in respiratory complex activation and an increase in tissue injury by oxidative stress by 7 days post-ischaemia. These results indicate that targeting the early decrease in membrane viability or mitochondrial permeability transition pore opening combined with anti-apoptotic therapeutics, may attenuate the proceeding mitochondrial impairment in oxidative phosphorylation, reactive oxygen species generation and subsequent cell death cascades. The current investigations into the temporal profile and quantitative contributions of the inflammatory, immune and apoptotic mechanisms post-stroke highlight potential strategies for modulation by acute stroke therapeutics. Furthermore, the general knowledge amassed from these studies dictates the necessity of a new approach to therapeutic intervention. The acknowledgement of so many contributing systems suggests that in addition to a thrombolytic, a combination therapy involving multiple neuroprotectants should be employed to account for the multifaceted nature of the sequelae of ischaemic stroke.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cerebrovascular disease</field><field name="subject">physiological aspects</field><field name="subject">cerebral ischemia</field><field name="subject">chemotherapy</field><field name="subject">catechin</field><field name="subject">nervous system</field><field name="subject">degeneration</field><field name="subject">treatment</field><field name="subject">neuroprotective agents</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070508.122246</field></doc><doc><field name="title">&#65533;The danger of vertigo&#65533; : an evaluation and critique of Theosis in the theology of Thomas Forsyth Torrance</field><field name="creator">Habets, Michael</field><field name="description">The Christian tradition, both East and West, has developed various models and theories of the atonement as explanations of what it means to speak of the reconciling activity of God in Christ. Central to these has been the claim that God has reconciled the world to himself in Christ. One way of testifying to the reconciling love of God has been the adoption of the metaphor theosis (&#65533;divinization&#65533;, &#65533;deification&#65533;) as an explanation of salvation. While central to Eastern Orthodoxy, a doctrine of theosis also has a rich tradition within Western, especially Reformed theology. The Reformed theologian, Thomas Forsyth Torrance, represents an attempt to construct a soteriology that incorporates both Eastern and Western models of the atonement around the controlling metaphor of theosis. A close reading of his theology presents a robust and clearly articulated doctrine of theosis as a key way of expressing God&#65533;s reconciling activity in Christ. As the true Man and the last Adam, Christ represents the arche and telos of human existence, the one in whose image all humanity has been created and into whose likeness all humanity is destined to be transformed from glory to glory. Through the Incarnation the Son becomes human without ceasing to be divine, to unite humanity and divinity together and effect a &#65533;deification&#65533; of human nature, mediated to men and women who are said to be &#65533;in Christ&#65533; by the work of the Holy Spirit. By means of a &#65533;wonderful exchange&#65533; Christ takes what is ours and gives us what is his. For Torrance, this is the heart of atonement. The goal of humanity is worship, something Torrance defines as the gift of participating through the Spirit in the incarnate Son&#65533;s communion with the Father. The locus of worship, and thus of theosis, is the church, the communion of saints created by the fellowship of the Holy Spirit. Throughout Torrance&#65533;s doctrines of creation, anthropology, incarnation, reconciliation, and pneumato-ecclesiology, the concept of theosis plays a central and constitutive role in explaining a Christian theology of salvation. Theosis is thus foundational to Torrance&#65533;s theology and is one way in which he holds together in systematic fashion his diverse theological oeuvre.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Thomas Forsyth Torrance (1913-)</field><field name="subject">doctrinal theology</field><field name="subject">deification</field><field name="subject">atonement</field><field name="subject">salvation</field><field name="subject">Christianity</field><field name="subject">History of Doctrines</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070508.120857</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Stable isotope tracers of landfill leachate impacts on aquatic systems</field><field name="creator">North, Jessica C.</field><field name="description">The present study aimed to determine whether stable isotope techniques can be universally applied to detect landfill leachate contamination in aquatic systems.

The unique conditions within a landfill lead to measurable fractionations in the isotopic ratios of the products of degradation. Results of isotope and ancillary parameter analyses enabled the discernment of different types of leachate, resulting from different microbial processes within the landfill environment. The isotopic characterisation of leachate enabled improved interpretation of geochemical data from potentially impacted surface and ground waters, and provides useful insight to landfill development for landfill operators. A general isotopic fingerprint delineated by [delta]&#65533;&#65533;C-DIC and [delta]D-H&#8322;O values showed leachate to be isotopically distinct from uncontaminated surface and ground water for samples analysed in the present study. However, not all water samples identified as leachate-impacted via site-specific assessments exhibited isotopic values that overlapped with the general leachate fingerprint. This highlights the need to investigate each site individually, within the context of a possibly global leachate isotope signature. Site-specific investigations revealed the effectiveness of applying [delta]&#65533;&#8312;O-H&#8322;O and [delta]&#65533;&#8309;N-NH&#8324;&#8314; or [delta]&#65533;&#8309;N-NO&#8323;&#8315;, in addition to [delta]&#65533;&#65533;C-DIC and [delta]D-H&#8322;O analyses, to the detection of leachate impact on aquatic systems. Furthermore, ancillary parameters such as alkalinity and ammonium concentration enabled the construction of simple isotope mixing models for an estimate of the quantity of leachate contribution. Results of isotopic investigations of stream biota suggested potential for the development of bio-indicators to monitor leachate influence on aquatic ecosystems in landfill-associated streams. The present study demonstrated the probative power of stable isotope techniques applied to investigations of leachate impact on landfill-associated aquatic systems.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">stable isotope tracers</field><field name="subject">fills (earthwork)</field><field name="subject">leachate</field><field name="subject">environmental aspects</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070504.144317</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Novel survival factors with a gender specific twist for motor neurons</field><field name="creator">Wang, Pei-Yu</field><field name="description">The survival of motor neurons is controlled by multiple factors, which regulate different aspects of their physiology. The identification of these factors is important because of their relevance for motor neuron disease. This thesis began with a search for novel growth factors that naturally keep these neurons alive. Members of the TGF-&#946; superfamily, including Mullerian inhibiting substance (MIS) and bone morphogenetic protein 6 (BMP6), were identified as putative survival factors following a cDNA microarray analysis of a mouse model of motor neuron disease. 
 MIS is a gonad-derived hormone with a male bias. It induces the degeneration of the female reproductive tract during development and it was thought to have no physiological function outside of the reproductive system. In this thesis, multiple techniques were used to show that adult motor neurons produce MIS and its receptors. The copy number of MIS mRNA in motor neurons was comparable with that of the testis, whereas the mRNA of the MIS type II receptor (MISRII) in motor neurons appeared to be the most abundant receptor of the TGF-&#946; superfamily. These results were confirmed using Western blot and immunohistochemistry. Thus, MIS may exert its function through an autocrine or a paracrine mechanism between neighbouring motor neurons. 
 The function of MIS was examined using a culture system and a mouse null mutation of MISRII. The in vitro assays showed strong neurotrophic effects of MIS on embryonic motor neurons with the maximum extent of survival being similar to that achieved by the classical motor neuron survival factor, GDNF. MIS has a male bias in utero raising the issue of whether motor neurons are sexually dimorphic. Consistent with this, the number of motor neurons in the lumbar lateral motor column of neonatal male MISRII+/+ mice was 13 % greater than in female mice (P = 0.01). The nuclei of male motor neurons were approximately 20 % larger than their female counterparts (P = 0.000). MISRII-/- male mice had 18 % fewer motor neurons than wild-type males (P = 0.01) and the mean size of their motor neurons was 20 % smaller (P = 0.000). The number and size of motor neurons in the MISRII-/- males was not different to those of MISRII+/+ females. These results implicate MIS as being responsible for neuronal survival as well as producing sexual dimorphism of the limb innervating motor neurons. Since MIS does not appear to be expressed in the embryonic neuromuscular system, it is postulated that MIS is a gonad-derived neurotrophic factor for developing motor neurons. 
 The BMP type II receptor (BMPRII) was the second most abundant receptor of the TGF-&#946; superfamily expressed by motor neurons. One of its ligands, BMP6, was found to have a neurotrophic effect on motor neurons in culture but was slightly less potent than MIS. BMP6 mRNA was detected in nerve, skeletal muscle and spinal cord, but not in motor neurons. BMP6 immunoreactivity was mainly associated with the myelinated Schwann cells and satellite glia that surround motor neurons. In skeletal muscles, immunoreactivity was not detected in muscle fibers, nor the postsynaptic region of the neuromuscular junction (NMJ). BMP6 was, however, associated with the interstitial cells of skeletal muscles. Double nerve ligations were used to examine whether Schwann cell-derived BMP6 interacts with motor neurons. Consistent with this, BMP6 was retrogradely transported in motor axons. These observations collectively suggest that BMP6 is a glia-derived regulator of motor neurons. 
 MIS and minority of BMP6 were anterogradely transported towards the NMJ. Their receptors, MISRII and BMPRII, were detected in the postsynaptic portions of the adult NMJ. These observations raised the possibility that MIS and BMP6 may be regulators of the adult NMJ. Since functional redundancy amongst the members of the TGF-&#946; superfamily has been suggested, the function of MIS/BMP6 signaling at the NMJ was therefore examined in mice with muscle-specific deletion of Smad4, a central mediator of TGF-&#946; superfamily pathways. More than 75% of animals lacking Smad4 in muscles died before embryonic day (E) 14 and none survived postnally. This was due to the loss of functional Smad4 in developing cardiac myocytes, which resulted in severe heart defects and early death of embryos. Thus, the function of MIS/BMP6 signaling at the adult NMJ could not be studied. 
 Finally, this thesis briefly examined the phenotypes of mice carrying double null mutations of MISRII and TGF-&#946;2. The animals died at an early stage and showed a more severe phenotype than either of the single null mutants. This suggests that functional redundancy among members of the TGF-&#946; superfamily exists in many organs. 
 In summary, motor neurons require multiple sources of growth factors for their survival. MIS and BMP6 were discovered as novel survival factors for motor neurons in this study. MIS was implicated as a regulator of sexual dimorphism in developing motor neurons, whereas both MIS and BMP6 appear to regulate mature motor neurons, and possibly the NMJ.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">motor neurons</field><field name="subject">physiology</field><field name="subject">sex differences</field><field name="subject">growth factors</field><field name="subject">survival analysis (Biometry)</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070504.143741</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cytochrome P450 activity and pollutant exposure in New Zealand native birds</field><field name="creator">Numata, Mihoko</field><field name="description">Birds are potentially vulnerable to the toxicity of certain environmental pollutants due to limited detoxification capabilities of their liver microsomal cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes. In wild birds, ethoxyresorufin O-deethylation (EROD) activity, a marker of CYP1A activity in mammals and domestic chickens, has been used as a biomarker of exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs) and dibenzofurans (PCDFs). The aim of the present study was to investigate hepatic CYP activity as an indication of detoxification capacity in New Zealand birds. In addition to the use of conventional in vitro CYP activity assays, the applicability of a noninvasive CYP activity assay was tested using caffeine as the in vivo substrate. 
 The ontogeny of liver microsomal 3-hydroxylation of quinine, a marker of human CYP3A activity, was investigated in Adelie penguins (Pygoscelis adeliae) from Ross Island, Antarctica. The results indicate that chicks (2-4 weeks old) possess a CYP3A-like isoform(s) as active as but not identical to the CYP3A-like isoform(s) in adults. Total CYP content was low at 2 weeks of age and increased rapidly and linearly approaching adult levels by 4 weeks of age implying a rapid development of CYPs other than the CYP3A-like isoform(s). 
 The main study was conducted on adult (and some post-fledging immature) birds of two native species, the herbivorous paradise shelduck (Tadorna variegata) and the omnivorous southern black-backed gull (Larus dominicanus). Birds were shot for liver collection at three sites in the South Island of New Zealand; West Coast, Lake Waipori and Dunedin landfill, in 2001-2002. The results indicate that shelducks posssess multiple CYP isoforms that independently catalyse EROD, p-nitrophenol hydroxylation (p-NP) and erythromycin demethylation (EMD), markers of mammalian CYP1A, CYP2E and CYP3A activity, respectively. In contrast, gulls appear to possess a single isoform catalysing both EROD and p-NP but possess no isoform capable of catalysing EMD. 
 EROD activity was high in shelducks and gulls from the landfill site, although it was not significantly associated with liver concentrations of PCBs (0.079-6.2 and 8.2-310 ng/g in shelducks and gulls, respectively), PCDD/PCDFs, toxic equivalents (TEQs) and dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE) (0.85-317 and 44-4800 ng/g in shelducks and gulls, respectively) in either species. In shelduck livers from the landfill site, EROD was positively associated with Pb concentration but negatively associated with Hg concentration. Assessment of PCB congener patterns based on concentration ratios of individual congeners to the reference congener, 2,2&#65533;,4,4&#65533;,5,5&#65533;-hexachlorobiphenyl (IUPAC #153), indicate that the metabolism of 2,4,4&#65533;-trichlorobiphenyl (PCB#28) and 2,4,4&#65533;,5-tetrachlorobiphenyl (PCB#74) is inducible in shelducks but not in gulls. Hepatic reduced glutathione (GSH) content was higher in gulls than in shelducks suggesting greater resistance to oxidative stress in gulls. 
 The in vivo caffeine metabolism test as a noninvasive method to determine CYP1A activity in shelducks and gulls gave a positive outcome. The test was performed by administration of a single intraperitoneal dose of caffeine (1 mg/kg body weight) followed by blood collection at 2 and 4 h after caffeine administration for determination of the serum concentration ratio of the metabolite, paraxanthine, to caffeine (PX/CA) by HPLC. In both species, the PX/CA ratio was markedly increased by pretreatment with the model CYP1A inducer, &#946;-naphthoflavone (BNF). BNF treatment also increased EROD activity determined after death (80-fold and 20-fold compared to controls in shelducks and gulls, respectively). However, sensitivity of the PX/CA ratio approach was lower in gulls than in shelducks due presumably to the formation of unidentified caffeine metabolites in gulls. Immunoblot analysis failed to reveal increased CYP protein levels caused by BNF treatment in shelducks and gulls due to poor cross-reactivity of avian proteins with polyclonal antibodies raised against mammalian CYPs. 
 EROD activity was also determined in livers of the piscivorous yellow-eyed penguin (Megadyptes antipodes) (1 chick, 3 post-fledging immature, 1 adult) from Otago, South Island of New Zealand, and found to be below the limit of quantitation. The adult liver contained 18.5 ng/g of total PCBs suggesting that EROD in this species is insensitive to induction. Comparison of the PCB congener pattern based on [PCBx]/[PCB#153] between the penguin and its putative source of PCB exposure, New Zealand marine fish, indicates that CYPs in yellow-eyed penguins metabolise 2,2&#65533;,5,5&#65533;-tetrachlorobiphenyl (PCB#52) and 2,2&#65533;,4,5,5&#65533;-pentachlorobiphenyl (PCB#101) as in many other avian species. 
 The findings of this study highlight substantial species differences in CYP activity in wild birds. Whether CYP expression in New Zealand birds is genetically distinct from birds in other parts of the world may warrant further investigation.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cytochrome P-450</field><field name="subject">birds</field><field name="subject">effect of pollution</field><field name="subject">environmental toxicology</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070504.141101</field></doc><doc><field name="title">In vitro and In vivo investigations of tolerance induction and the role of G-protein coupled kainate receptors</field><field name="creator">Hesp, Blair</field><field name="description">The excitotoxin domoic acid (DOM) acts at both kainic acid (KA)- and &#945;-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionate (AMPA)-sensitive glutamate receptors. Clinical reports suggest that elderly people are hypersensitive to the neurological effects of DOM intoxication. Young, but not aged hippocampal slices which have been preconditioned with low concentrations of DOM or KA exhibit an acute &#65533;tolerance&#65533; to subsequent high doses of DOM or KA; application of the selective AMPA agonist fluorowillardiine (FW) fails to induce tolerance to excitotoxins. The aim of this study was to further investigate the molecular mechanism of tolerance induction in vitro, and to examine the ability of compounds to cross-condition against excitotoxic insult. In addition, in vivo techniques were used to explore the age-related susceptibility to the neurological effects of DOM and acute in vivo tolerance induction. Here we show that low doses of &#65533;classical&#65533; ionotropic kainate receptor agonists and AMPA/kainate receptor antagonists act as net inverse agonists at G-protein coupled receptors, reducing constitutive GTPase activity by up to 73% in the young hippocampus. Further evidence that inverse agonist activity at G-protein coupled receptors is responsible for acute in vitro tolerance induction by kainate receptor agonists and antagonists was also identified because preconditioning with the AMPA receptor antagonist GYKI-52466 significantly inhibited KA-induced population spike suppression in in vitro hippocampal brain slices from both Sprague-Dawley and Wistar rats. The broad-spectrum protein kinase inhibitor H-7 partially blocked tolerance induction when preconditioning occurs in the presence of suggesting that protein kinases are one of the downstream effectors of this phenomenon. Tolerance-inducing compounds are also capable of cross-conditioning against the effects of other excitotoxins; with 250 nM FW suppressed population spike area by only 62.8 &#65533; 10.0% at 30 minutes following a 500 nM KA preconditioning dose, compared to almost complete spike suppression within twenty minutes in naive hippocampal brain slices. In vivo experiments indicated that despite aged animals exhibiting significantly higher cumulative behavioural scores in response to i.p. DOM (1 mg kg&#8315;&#65533;; young = 102 &#65533; 9, aged = 179 &#65533; 19; P &lt; 0.01) in response to DOM after two hours), and that this age-related supersensitivity is due to impaired renal clearance (young serum DOM = 41.5 &#65533; 30.3 ng ml&#8315;&#65533;, aged = 813.3 &#65533; 804.4 ng ml&#8315;&#65533; following administration of 1 mg kg&#8315;&#65533; DOM after 2.5 hours earlier). Tolerance to high doses of DOM was induced within a matter of minutes following i.p. preconditioning by low dose DOM in vivo. This was evidenced by severe seizure manifestations being almost absent in both young and aged animals, despite occurring frequently in naive animals. Therefore, this study concludes that tolerance is induced by kainate receptor ligands in vitro and in vivo within a matter of minutes, and is the result of a reduction in the turnover of G-protein coupled receptors and protein kinase activation. In addition, the increased sensitivity of aged rats to in vivo DOM is a result of elevated serum DOM concentrations most likely resulting from impaired renal clearance.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">G proteins</field><field name="subject">domoic acid</field><field name="subject">older people</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070503.150053</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Preparation and evaluation of novel drug alginate granule systems using paracetamol as model drug</field><field name="creator">Mukhopadhyay, Debashis</field><field name="description">Purpose: The aim of this thesis was to investigate a novel method of preparing crosslinked alginate matrices. Current methods use large quantities of water and hence are not suitable for large scale manufacturing of drug alginate particulate systems. Moreover, the current processes offer little scope for control of the crosslinking process. The aim was to overcome these problems through studies of paracetamol alginate granular matrices prepared by the novel method and to explore if these granules could be used to improve the taste of paracetamol. 
 Methods: The novel method involves preparation of dried drug alginate granules (moisture content: &lt;5-6 %) using conventional granulation followed by crosslinking treatment of the dried granules with calcium chloride or a combination of calcium and magnesium ion solution in a crosslinking bath. The effect of the process (shear rate, binder quantity) to prepare untreated granules, composition of the raw materials (drug particle size and type of alginate) and subsequently the crosslinking treatment process variables (Ca&#65533;&#8314; ion concentration, agitation rate, time and temperature of Ca&#65533;&#8314; solution) on the physicochemical properties of granule systems were studied using factorial designs together with supporting studies. 
 The granules were characterized using sodium and calcium content analysis, drug release studies (mainly sub-60s release) matrix swelling rate and equilibrium swelling studies, tensile strength studies, ion permeation studies, SEM and X Ray analysis and gravimetric studies. Sensory studies correlating sub-60 s drug release (determined using a specially designed apparatus) and human taste scores (measured using an analogue scale) were then undertaken. Selected formulations were evaluated for taste improvement and to determine if mucoadhesion led to an increased unpalatability of paracetamol. 
 Results: Of the crosslinking treatment factors, the calcium concentration had the greatest effect on crosslinked granules. Although other treatment factors also affected the granule properties, alteration of the salt concentration allowed considerable control over the crosslinking process (not possible in the conventional method) in addition to providing a mechanistic understanding of the crosslinking process in the dried state. The use of low calcium concentrations (&lt; 20 mg/ml, CaCl&#8322;. 2H&#8322;O) during treatment led to granule erosion (hence drug loss) due to overall incomplete crosslinking but led to a reduction in the short-term drug release compared to the granules treated with intermediate (100- 250 mg/ml) or high calcium concentrations (&gt;400 mg/ml) due to reduction in the granule porosity after crosslinking. Although intermediate calcium concentrations led to complete crosslinking and longer release times (T 85 %: 25 min) high calcium crosslinking restricted the crosslinking to the surface of the granules leading to faster drug release (T 85 %: 8 min) with low calcium granules showing intermediate crosslinking and drug release rates (T 85 %: 18 min). High calcium treatment limited drug loss during crosslinking (95 % recovered compared to 83 % recovery at intermediate calcium concentration) without affecting the short-term drug release much. Low calcium granules showed the lowest drug recovery (&lt; 70 %) and slowest sub-60s drug release followed closely by intermediate and high calcium treated granules. 
 The granule preparation factors (shear rate, binder quantity) and type of alginate used, considerably affected the sub-60s drug release by affecting surface porosity especially when a low shear rate was used. However, these factors only slightly reduced the drug loss during crosslinking treatment phase (about 4 % increase in drug recovery). Smaller drug particle size had a slightly larger incremental effect on drug recovery (about 8 % increase in the drug recovery) during crosslinking treatment due to better embedding of the drug particles inside the untreated granule matrix. This was true as long as the particle size of the drug was &gt; 98 [mu]m. Below this size drug recovery remained unaffected by changes in drug particle size. Although granule surface porosity considerably affected the sub-60s drug release, its effect on drug release (long-term) was much less. 
 A linear correlation was observed between the sub-60s drug release and sensory scores despite high individual variability. Both granule formulations evaluated showed taste improvement and mucoadhesion did not lead to an increase in the bitter taste of the uncrosslinked paracetamol alginate granules. 
 Conclusions: Unlike the traditional method, the new technique of preparation of crosslinked drug alginate particulate systems uses very little water and allows greater control over the the crosslinking process compared to the swollen state crosslinking. The novel process of preparation is versatile, and should be scalable. It offers the formulator a platform to prepare a matrix, reservoir or a combination of these two systems using alginates and other drugs and polymers as well. Adequate short-term control over paracetamol release, very little loss of paracetamol during treatment (&lt; 5 % loss), reduction in mucoadhesion of the granules and lastly improvement of the taste of paracetamol is possible using alginate based systems especially if high calcium is used during the crosslinking treatment. Hence, it is likely that these taste-improved granules could be used to prepare tablets without the need for a protective film coating to improve taste. Finally, this research established the utility of short-term drug release in taste improvement research and characterization of solid controlled release dosage forms.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">alginates</field><field name="subject">drug delivery systems</field><field name="subject">granular materials</field><field name="subject">acetaminophen</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070503.143431</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Formulation approaches to minimise injection site reactions of poorly soluble drugs</field><field name="creator">Wu, Zimei</field><field name="description">Purpose: The aim of this study was to investigate the usefulness of formulation approaches to minimise injection site reactions for poorly soluble drugs. The specific objectives were to modify the injection site reactions by identification of irritant components in the formulation and control of their release kinetics; and to gain understanding of formulation approaches to create a favourable microenvironment in the tissues allowing better tissue tolerance and drug absorption. 
 Methods: Physicochemical properties of the model drug, ricobendazole (RBZ) were characterised using conventional methods. Three formulation approaches to minimise irritancy of the low pH RBZ solution were assessed. An in vitro method using 96-well microplates and a microtiter plate reader was used for detection of drug precipitation on dilution for formulation characterisation. Cellular damage by the formulations was investigated in L929 fibroblasts using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxy phenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium (MTS) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assays. Tissue tolerance and pharmacokinetics were simultaneously investigated after subcutaneous injection in sheep. A low pH RBZ solution was used as a reference formulation. 
 Results: Preformulation studies showed that RBZ was practically insoluble in water and oils, and was slightly soluble in commonly used co-solvents. Solubility was slightly improved by complexation with hydroxypropyl-&#946;-cyclodextrin (HP-&#946;-CD, K&#8321;:&#8321; = 311 M&#8315;&#65533;) or a combination of low pH (&gt; 2) with surfactants or co-solvents. A U-shaped pH-solubility profile in aqueous solutions indicated that RBZ is an ampholyte. pKa values measured by absorbance spectroscopy and pH solubility methods were 3.45 and 3.76 (basic) and 9.82 and 9.53 (acidic) respectively. The partition coefficient was 14.3 - 15.2 at pH 6 - 9 and less at higher or lower pH. In aqueous solutions, RBZ showed a V-shaped pH-degradation rate profile and was most stable at pH 4.8. Degradation pathways were identified as hydrolysis and oxidation. 
 Three RBZ injectables (5%) were obtained by modification of the low pH RBZ solution; addition of 20% HP-&#946;-CD, incorporation into a w/o emulsion, and a microemulsion (ME). On dilution with SPB, the onset time of drug precipitation was prolonged and the rate was reduced in the presence of HP-&#946;-CD. The w/o emulsion had a low viscosity (&lt; 60 mPa.s) and exhibited Newtonian flow. Drug release versus the square root of time was linear and the release rate could be adjusted by phase ratio and droplet size. Drug release was found to be by diffusion. A coarse emulsion layer appeared at the interface between the ME and buffer. Drug release from the ME was faster than from the emulsion and was linear with the square root of time. On titration into SPB, the three formulations showed controlling effects on the release of H&#8323;O&#8314; compared to the reference formulation. RBZ (0.1 mg/ml) was more toxic to L929 cells than the co-solvent propylene glycol (50 mg/ml). The formulations showed greater cytotoxicity than their vehicles in the order: ME &gt; RBZ solution = emulsion &gt; HP-&#946;-CD. HP-&#946;-CD and emulsion excipients showed little or no cytotoxicity. The MEs exhibited more toxicity in the LDH assay than in the MTS assay. 
 A reversed phase HPLC assay for simultaneous determination of RBZ and its metabolite in sheep plasma using an isocratic system with UV detection was developed and used in the pharmacokinetic studies. Plasma samples were prepared by solid phase extraction. A suitable internal standard was selected by quantitative structure-retention relationships analysis. The composition of a ternary mobile phase was optimised with the assistance of multiple linear regression. The assays were linear over the concentration range 10 - 1000 ng/ml for both analytes (r &gt; 0.999) with satisfactory inter-day and intra-day precision and accuracy (CV &lt; 10%). The recoveries for all analytes were &gt; 96%. 
 A pilot study in sheep suggests that injection of the vehicles (the CD, emulsion and ME) caused virtually no pain on injection or site reactions. Both the reference formulation and its vehicle induced pain on injection and resulted in swollen tissues. Histology after two weeks showed granulation for the formulation, but not the vehicle. In contrast, animals showed virtually no injection site reactions with the ME and emulsion. The HP-&#946;-CD formulation gave transient pain on injection but a two-fold increase in bioavailability compared with the reference. The emulsion produced sustained drug release and increased drug absorption. In the main study, the HP-&#946;-CD vehicle showed good tissue compatibility. Irritation by the HP-&#946;-CD formulation was attributed to the low pH. Cmax, tmax and AUC0-[infinity] for the reference formulation were 1.3 &#65533; 0.3 [mu]g/ml, 9.6 &#65533; 2.9 h and 36.7 &#65533; 9.2 [mu]g&#65533;h/ml respectively, while the corresponding data for the HP-&#946;-CD formulation were 2.9 &#65533; 0.8 [mu]g/ml, 5.0 &#65533; 0.6 h and 54.5 &#65533; 15.3 [mu]g&#65533;h/ml respectively. The half-life following the injection of the HP-&#946;-CD formulation (5.5 &#65533; 2.8 h) was shorter than that of the reference formulation (8.5 &#65533; 3.4 h). 
 Conclusions: Injection site reactions may be minimised by identification of irritant components in a formulation and by controlling their release. Controlling the burst release of the poorly water soluble drug RBZ in a low pH solution could improve tissue tolerance and minimise post-injection precipitation, and hence increase drug bioavailability. In addition, HP-&#946;-CD was a useful local injectable carrier which significantly enhanced the absorption of RBZ after subcutaneous injection in sheep.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">injections</field><field name="subject">side effects</field><field name="subject">drugs</field><field name="subject">solubility</field><field name="subject">bioavailability</field><field name="subject">inflammation</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070503.122315</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Regulation of Bub1b phosphorylation by protein phosphatase 2A</field><field name="creator">Wallis, Lise J.</field><field name="description">The mitotic spindle checkpoint plays a critical role during the cell cycle by protecting the faithful transmission of chromosomes during mitosis. If chromosomes are improperly bound to the spindle microtubules the checkpoint will prevent progress to anaphase by temporarily arresting cells in metaphase until all the chromosomes are correctly aligned. Bub1b is an essential component of the mitotic spindle checkpoint that transiently localises to kinetochores during mitosis and becomes phosphorylated, a response that is sustained during mitotic arrest. Bub1b has been implicated in other processes related to mitotic progression and is thought to regulate mitotic timing and have a role in caspase mediated cell death after prolonged mitotic arrest. The development of aneuploidy and cancer has been associated with mutations in the BUB1B gene and reduction in the level of Bub1b protein. To further our understanding of Bub1b function in the spindle checkpoint and mitosis, new protein interactions involving Bub1b were identified. This thesis describes the search for alternative proteins that interact with Bub1b, and their function in the mitotic spindle checkpoint and regulation of Bub1b activity. 
 Using a yeast two-hybrid approach, members of the B56 family of regulatory subunits of serine-threonine protein phosphatase (PP2A) were identified as novel interacting partners of Bub1b. Substrate specificity of PP2A is determined by the regulatory subunits. There are five characterised isoforms of the B56 family, each encoded by separate genes. In addition, some isoforms have several recognised splice variants. Confirmation of interactions by alternative methods demonstrated that the isoforms B56&#947; and B56[epsilon] preferentially interact with phosphorylated Bub1b, whereas the interaction of the remaining B56 isoforms (&#945;, &#946; and [delta]) occurs at a lower affinity with no specificity for the phosphorylated form. It was further demonstrated that B56&#947;1 associated with phosphorylated Bub1b in vivo. 
 Induced overexpression of splice variants of B56&#947;1 and B56&#947;2 demonstrated a significant reduction in levels of phosphorylated Bub1b during mitotic spindle checkpoint activation. In addition, an associated lower mitotic index was evident in cells with B56&#947;1 overexpression. Specific inhibition of PP2A activity with okadaic acid was shown to prolong Bub1b phosphorylation during normal mitosis and to restore the levels of phosphorylated Bub1b in arrested cells over expressing B56&#947;. These findings suggest a role for PP2A activity in regulation of Bub1b function that is mediated through substrate recognition by B56 regulatory subunits.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">phosphorylation</field><field name="subject">phosphoprotein phosphatases</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070502.114819</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Terminus disintegration of debris-covered, lake-calving glaciers</field><field name="creator">Roehl, Katrin</field><field name="description">Numerous supraglacial and proglacial lakes have developed on debris-covered glaciers in conjunction with 20th-century retreat associated with global warming. When a glacier holds a substantial debris cover on its lower reach and/or is calving into a proglacial water body, the behaviour of its terminus can be modified to varying degrees compared to that of land-terminating or debris-free glaciers. The terminus is not just retreating from its frontal position but it is disintegrating through several processes that are linked. An improved understanding of these glacier margins is needed for the prediction and management of hazards associated with these types of lakes for hydroelectric power generation, recreational purposes and areas threatened by potential glacier outburst floods as well as for the interpretation of glacio-geological records and reconstruction of former glacial environments and palaeoclimate. 
 The principal research question of this study is how processes of ice loss contribute to the terminus disintegration of a debris-covered, lake-calving glacier. This is addressed by an application of a field-based strategy which includes extensive field observations of variables, processes and their controls, and subsequent analysis of the data in the light of previous models and concepts. The study attempts to combine and integrate different aspects of glaciological research that have previously been examined mostly separately. It investigates the prevalent processes at the glacier terminus and their controls over different time periods ranging from days to years at Mueller, Hooker and Tasman Glaciers in Mount Cook National Park, New Zealand. The data form the basis for models of calving and pond development and future retreat scenarios. 
 This study has demonstrated that this glacial environment is characterised by ice-frontal processes with complex inter-relationships that vary between glaciers and in particular between stages of terminus development. While surface ice melt in the terminus area is substantially reduced by supraglacial debris, sub-debris melt contributes the largest fraction of ice loss. Other important effects of debris are restraining thermal undercutting, reducing subaqueous melt and decreasing buoyancy. Data from supraglacial ponds and proglacial lakes show that limnological factors become increasingly important with increasing pond/lake size. Changes in water currents and temperature lead to changes in significance and rates of ice loss processes, the most important being the change from melting to predominantly calving. This study has confirmed the hypothesis that thermal undercutting is the rate-controlling process for calving. This process is controlled by the cliff geometry, debris supply, subaqueous geometry and water temperatures, currents and level variations. The results from the examination of calving processes suggest that the process of regular, progressive calving through the stages suggested previously may not be widely applicable to slow-moving, lake-calving glaciers. The several forms of subaerial calving identified in this study can present themselves as largely independent events, a combination of events or as a progression. At the central submerged part of the ice face, subaqueous ice melt is likely to be the dominant form of ice loss, leading to horizontal ice loss. Subaqueous calving is prevalent in gently-sloping lateral areas, leading to vertical ice loss. This process is controlled by buoyancy forces which are affected by sedimentation and lake and glacier geometry. The onset of subaqueous calving in the earlier stages of lake development is a crucial process for the transition to faster disintegration and ice loss, accelerating subaqueous melt. Due to the complex inter-relationships attempts to formulate general relationships between calving or retreat rates and other glaciological parameters may not be feasible.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">glaciers</field><field name="subject">measurement</field><field name="subject">climatic changes</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Mount Cook National Park</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070502.112854</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Phn and Pst systems of Mycobacterium smegmatis : phosphate transport and gene regulation</field><field name="creator">Gebhard, Susanne</field><field name="description">Phosphate is an essential but often growth-limiting nutrient for bacteria. At low concentrations of phosphate in the growth medium, bacteria induce high-affinity uptake systems for phosphate, and this is usually the ABC-type phosphate specific transport system Pst. In the fully sequenced genomes of pathogenic species of mycobacteria, several copies of the genes encoding for the Pst system (pstSCAB) have been identified and some of these genes have been shown to be virulence factors. The reasons for the presence of multiple copies of pst genes in pathogenic mycobacteria are not understood, and phosphate transport by these bacteria, as well as the gene regulation involved, is poorly characterised. The fast-growing M. smegmatis contains only a single copy of the pst operon, but we recently identified a gene locus containing three genes, phnDCE, which encode for a putative ABC-type phosphate/phosphonate transport system, and a gene, phnF, which encodes for a putative transcriptional regulator of the HutC subfamily of GntR like regulators. 
 To identify a function for the PhnDCE transport system and to characterise high-affinity phosphate transport in M. smegmatis, we created allelic exchange mutants in phnD and pstS, as well as a phnD pstS double deletion mutant. All three mutants failed to grow in minimal medium containing 10 mM phosphate, while the wildtype was able to grow in the presence of micromolar phosphate concentrations. No differences were observed in complex growth medium. Steady-state levels of [&#65533;&#65533;P]-phosphate uptake were approximately 25% lower in all mutant strains as compared to the wildtype. Kinetics of phosphate uptake in the wildtype strain when grown at low phosphate concentrations (50 [mu]M P[i]) were biphasic, suggesting the presence of two inducible transport systems with apparent K[m] values of 16 [mu]M P[i] and 64 [mu]M P[i], respectively. Analysis of the kinetics of phosphate transport in the mutant strains led us to the proposition that the Pst system has an apparent Km value of ca. 16 [mu]M P[i], and the Phn system has an apparent Km of ca. 60 [mu]M P[i]. A third inducible phosphate transport system, which was active in the double mutant strain, had an apparent K[m] of ca. 90 [mu]M P[i]. Uptake of phosphate in all strains was not inhibited by the presence of excess phosphonates or phosphite, suggesting that all three transport systems were specific for phosphate. The study of phosphate transport in the presence of various metabolic inhibitors revealed that uptake by the Phn and Pst systems is driven by ATP-hydrolysis, consistent with ABC-type transport, while the third, unidentified transport system may be driven by the proton motive force. 
 We showed that phnDCE formed an operon, and that the promoter area of the operon lies within 200 bp of the start of phnD. To investigate the regulation of the phn and pst genes, &#946;-galacosidase activities of strains carrying transcriptional lacZ-fusions of the pstSCAB, phnDCE and phnF promoter areas, and levels of mRNA of the phn and pst genes were studied. All genes were induced when phosphate concentrations fell below a threshold value of 30 [mu]M, which coincided with a shift in the growth characteristics of M. smegmatis. Expression of the pst operon appeared to be controlled directly by the PhoPR two-component regulatory system, while the phn operon may be under direct or indirect control by PhoPR. 
 To identify a role for PhnF in the regulation of phn gene expression, we created a phnF deletion mutant. PhnF appeared to repress transcription of phnDCE and phnF under phosphate-replete conditions. We identified two putative binding sequences for PhnF in the intergenic region between phnD and phnF with the sequence TGGTATAGACCA, which is similar to the proposed recognition consensus for HutC-like transcriptional regulators. Using site-directed mutagenesis of these sequences, we demonstrated that they are required for the repression of phnDCE and phnF. To prove PhnF binding to these potential binding sites, we attempted to express the M. smegmatis PhnF protein in E. coli, but could not obtain soluble recombinant protein. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays of the phnDCE promoter fragment using cell-free crude extracts of M. smegmatis were not successful. 
 We propose that Pst and Phn both constitute high-affinity phosphate specific transport systems of M. smegmatis, and that a third inducible phosphate transport system is present in this bacterium. PhnF is required for repression of phnDCE and phnF transcription under phosphate-replete conditions, while induction of the pst operon, and possibly the phn operon, under phosphate-limited conditions involves the PhoPR system.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mycobacterium smegmatis</field><field name="subject">genetic regulation</field><field name="subject">hydrogen-ion concentration</field><field name="subject">physiological effect</field><field name="subject">active biological transport</field><field name="subject">phosphates</field><field name="subject">metabolism</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070502.112113</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Performance management : an empirical study</field><field name="creator">Stringer, Carolyn Patricia</field><field name="description">The dynamic nature of performance management is a significant issue for organisations. A review of the empirical performance management literature highlights that little research has examined an organisation&#65533;s holistic performance management framework. Most prior studies have been partial (i.e., examine various performance management elements), and there is a lack of depth in analysis (because of the short-term nature of many studies). In addition to the few studies that have examined the interconnections between the performance management elements, there has also been a lack of research examining incentive systems (especially at lower levels), target-setting, and performance evaluation. The literature review in this thesis also highlights the diversity in the performance management elements studied, the lack of theoretical development, diversity in who is interviewed and research sites, etc. This diversity in field study research provides a difficult base on which to build a cumulative body of literature (as most studies examine a different research question in a different context). 
 This PhD research examines the overall performance management framework in a large and complex Australasian organisation, Sensol, over a 14 year period. The research is inductive, empirical and interpretative so as to gain a deeper understanding of Sensol&#65533;s performance management framework. The narrative highlights the multiple voices that exist in Sensol to illustrate the complexity of performance management at various levels. Otley&#65533;s (1999) performance management framework is a useful research tool (e.g., initial data analysis, structuring device). 
 The documentary evidence traces the history and development of Sensol&#65533;s performance management framework. The designers&#65533; story tells about the sophisticated nature of Sensol&#65533;s approach to performance management. In contrast, the business unit managers describe the complexities in operationalising performance management in a complex, diversified and decentralised organisation. 
 The researcher&#65533;s story explains the importance of understanding the highly interconnected nature of Sensol&#65533;s performance management framework and of understanding the behavioural issues (e.g., intense sibling rivalry, short-termism). It includes the importance of history, context (e.g., hierarchical culture), decentralised structure (e.g., interrelated business units), the trade-offs between financial and social objectives (and signalling effect of weightings), performance measurement issues (e.g., EVA&#65533;, scorecard, dominance of EBIT, transfer pricing), the subjectivity of objective setting and performance management processes (e.g., averaging, little differentiation between good and poor performers), problems with the annual incentive scheme (e.g., double dipping, risk and penalties, lack of understanding and line of sight, low trust), strategic programmes (e.g., lack of visibility), target-setting (e.g., conservative targets, impact of capping), and information flows (i.e., poor data, black boxes). 
 The research also highlights the importance of understanding how the formal and informal performance management systems operate. There are considerable differences between the designers&#65533; rhetoric on the formal HPMF system (i.e., the intended design), compared to the system in use (e.g., formal and informal systems). This point has been recognised in some prior field studies but is an under-researched area. An understanding of the impact of the background to the performance management literature from classical management theory provides some insights into why the value-based management literature focuses on formal system design control tools, goal congruence, top-down focus, and the universal applicability of their techniques. Ignoring informal systems may be one reason that the traditional control problems remain evident with the new value-based management techniques. 
 A final contribution of this PhD research is to use historical documents to identify how little change there has been over time and how performance management issues keep going around in circles (e.g., lack of accountability, transfer pricing). Some reasons for these circles include that history is lost, complacency, culture, communication issues (e.g., good news, blocking behaviours, standardisation). A feature of Sensol&#65533;s performance management framework is how it used EVA&#65533; and the balanced scorecard in a complementary manner. However, rather than adopting these new techniques as prescribed by consultants, Sensol built these new techniques onto their existing performance management system. This highlights the importance of understanding the history of an organisation&#65533;s performance management framework, so as to understand the reasons for the current design and operation.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">performance</field><field name="subject">management</field><field name="subject">personnel management</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070501.145211</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Gene expression profiling of human granulosa cells</field><field name="creator">Quinn, Michael Corwin James</field><field name="description">Human granulosa cells play an important role in the follicle, providing the oocyte with nutrients and growth factors to ensure successful ovulation. Normal granulosa cell functioning is thus crucial to human fertility. By studying their transcriptome, the mechanisms underpinning follicle development and infertility will be better understood. 
 In this study, granulosa cells were retrieved at the time of oocyte removal for in vitro fertilization (IVF). Cells were purified through a combination of a Percoll gradient to remove red blood cells and positive selection of granulosa cell aggregations. On average, contamination by white blood cells was 2% as measured by FACS analysis using specific white blood cell markers. Histological and electron microscopy of granulosa cell aggregations did not detect evidence of resident ovarian white blood cells. This technique provided a good source of pure, healthy granulosa cells for RNA extraction and subsequent gene expression studies. 
 The construction of a human granulosa cell SAGE library derived 1689 SAGEtags and 1289 discrete mRNA transcripts. SAGEtags for a number of well recognized granulosa cell genes (FSH receptor, follistatin, connexin 43) were found in addition to hormone receptors, multiple kinases, structural genes, apoptosis related genes and secreted proteins. A variety of other SAGE libraries were downloaded from SAGEmap (two ovary epithelium, ovary, white blood cell, brain, cerebellum, heart, liver, lung, kidney, pancreas and universal human reference) and compared to the human granulosa cell library. This was based on two measures: a gene specificity score (GSS) and a tissue specificity score (TSS). Three SAGEtags were identified with high levels of expression in granulosa cells, but no or low expression in the other libraries. These were retinol binding protein 1 (RBP 1), scavenger receptor class B member 1 (SCARB 1) and hydroxysteroid (11-beta) dehydrogenase 1 (11-&#946;-HSD). Library comparisons were validated by real time RT-PCR. The TSS score revealed granulosa cells were most similar to the universal reference library and least similar to liver. 
 Granulosa cell samples were collected from woman undergoing IVF for a range of infertility disorders. These included polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), tubal disease, endometriosis and idiopathic (unknown). Gene expression was compared between these groups using real time RT-PCR. Candidate genes included RBP 1, 11-&#946;-HSD, SCARB 1, FSH receptor, follistatin, decidual protein induced by progesterone, and progesterone membrane receptor component 1 and 2. Granulosa cell gene expression was significantly different (p&lt;0.05) from human white blood cells. No differences were found in gene expression levels between the infertility disorders. Analysis of each patient, however, revealed individuals with marked over-expression of selected genes. 
 The technique of Generation of Longer cDNA fragments for Gene Identification (GLGI) was used to investigate seven SAGEtags that did match known genes or ESTs. Although no novel genes were characterized, a further 14 granulosa cell transcripts were identified by this technique. 
 This thesis used an integrated approach to the study of human granulosa cell gene expression. This has involved development of a purification method, the use of a high-throughput technique (SAGE), bioinformatics tools to identify candidates genes, real time RT-PCR to investigate gene expression of particular genes in infertility disorders and finally a technique with the potential to characterize unknown SAGEtags (GLGI). This systematic approach has advanced the understanding of gene expression in human granulosa cells and identified avenues for future research into folliculogenesis and human infertility.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">gene expression</field><field name="subject">granuloma</field><field name="subject">cytology</field><field name="subject">growth factors</field><field name="subject">human fertility</field><field name="subject">microbiology</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070501.144002</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Campylobacter jejuni : virulence, dosage, survival, and colonisation characteristics</field><field name="creator">Pope, Christopher E.</field><field name="description">In a previous study, twenty-five flaA types were detected among 200 Campylobacter jejuni isolates obtained from clinical and poultry meat sources. 
 The most common flaA type detected among poultry isolates was flaA-3 at a frequency of 23%. In contrast, flaA-3 constituted 5% of the clinical isolates. FlaA-15 was detected most frequently among clinical isolates (31%) but rarely among poultry isolates (5%). Purchasers of poultry meat were therefore commonly exposed to flaA-3 yet most of the human infections were due to flaA type 15. The prevalence of different flaA types in poultry and humans might have been due to: FlaA-15 was more virulent for humans than flaA-3 (infection more likely to result). There were more C. jejuni flaA-15 cells on poultry meat (dose effect). Better survival of flaA-15 cells when freeze/thawed or when stored at +4&#65533;C (survival in kitchen). Ecological performance of flaA-3 strains in chicken gut better than that of flaA-15 (more flaA -3 cells in gut therefore greater chance of carcass contamination)? 
 Eleven strains representing flaA types 3, 13, and 15 were tested for their ability to invade cultured human epithelial cells (HEp-2). Invasiveness was considered to reflect virulence. FlaA-15 isolates were more invasive in comparison to flaA-3 and flaA-13 isolates (p&lt;0.0001). 
 Washings from chicken portions were cultured to enumerate Campylobacter cells present on the meat. C. jejuni isolates were flaA typed and the numbers were related to FlaA type. A correlation was not detected. 
 The eleven representative strains were used to inoculate 1 cm&#65533; sections of chicken skin which were stored at -20&#65533;C or +4&#65533;C over a five day period. The samples stored at -20&#65533;C were thawed and held either overnight at 25&#65533;C, overnight at +4&#65533;C or for thirty minutes at 25&#65533;C. The numbers of viable Campylobacter cells on the sections were determined. Survival ability differed from strain to strain but was not associated with flaA type. 
 The most invasive C. jejuni strain (T1016; flaA-15) and the least invasive strain (Pstau; flaA-3) were assessed for their ability to colonise the intestinal tract of one-day-old chicks. The dynamics of colonisation, after inoculation of the birds with pure cultures or with mixtures, was monitored by real-time quantitative PCR. Strain-specific primers based on the variable region of the nucleotide base sequence of flaA genes were derived for this work. This enabled the individual strains to be enumerated in gut contents from colonized chickens. Both strains could colonise the chick intestinal tract but C. jejuni strain T1016 (flaA-15) could competitively exclude PStau (flaA-3). 
 It was concluded that the higher prevalence of flaA-15 strains among the clinical isolates was due to its higher virulence for humans. In other words, despite a low prevalence of flaA-15 on poultry meat, infection was more likely to result when C. jejuni flaA-15 cells were consumed.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Campylobacter jejuni</field><field name="subject">poultry</field><field name="subject">microbiology</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070501.141243</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Abused children in New Zealand/Aotearoa : presentation and investigation</field><field name="creator">McKenzie, Kay Helen</field><field name="description">The overarching goal of the present research was to identify the interface between research and practice in the area of child-abuse investigation. The specific aims of the research were to explore how abused children present to investigators, to identify the characteristics of the children&#65533;s disclosures and the role of disclosure in the investigation, to establish the factors that influenced child-abuse investigators&#65533; decisions to interview children, and to make comparisons between sexually- and physically-abused children. Three hundred substantiated cases of child abuse (150 sexual-abuse and 150 physical-abuse investigations) investigated by the Department of Child, Youth and Family Services of New Zealand, prior to July 2001, were analysed. 
 Children were most often physically-abused by their biological parents, and mothers were marginally more often the abusers than were fathers. The most common indicators of physical abuse were children&#65533;s disclosures and physical injuries. Risk factors for physical abuse included living in two-parent households and being of Maori or Pacific Island ethnicity. Gender or age provided no protection from physical abuse. The families of the physically-abused children were characterised by family violence, substance abuse, neglect, and poor mental health. Adverse family circumstances restrained children from telling others about their physical abuse. Physically-abused children aged more than 7 were found to present with a range of problem behaviours and fears. Child-abuse investigators often tolerated physical assaults on children, particularly by mothers. Moreover, child-abuse investigators did not routinely interview physically-abused children or treat the abuse as a criminal matter, especially if there were complicating family dynamics. 
 Sexually-abused children were usually victimised by unrelated, known males, less often by male relatives, and infrequently by strangers, fathers, or step-fathers. One-third of the sexual abusers were aged less than 17, and over 40% of the young offenders were aged less than 12. As with adult sexual offenders, the child and teenage sexual offenders were predominantly male. Child-abuse investigators usually did not refer the young sexual offenders to the authorities for follow-up. Risk factors for sexual abuse included being female and living with a single parent. Social workers often did not meet with sexually-abused children, but instead usually referred them for a forensic interview. Social workers may not have explored issues related to the sexually-abused children&#65533;s behaviour or their families in the manner that they did for the physically-abused children. 
 In both physical- and sexual-abuse cases, social workers were more likely to take action if children had made clear disclosures of abuse. However, despite disclosure being an important factor in decision-making, child-abuse investigators still did not meet with or interview every child, particularly preschool children and physically-abused children. The majority of factors that influenced child-abuse investigators&#65533; decisions to interview children were related to practice issues, in sexual-abuse cases, or tolerance of parental violence towards children, in physical-abuse cases. 
 Preschool children, whether physically- or sexually-abused, did not present differently from 5- or 6-year-olds in their behaviour or style of disclosure. However, compared to older children, child-abuse investigators were unlikely to interview preschoolers. 
 To conclude the thesis, I will highlight lessons to be learned from the present study and will make recommendations for child-abuse investigators, any professionals working with children and families, and the government of New Zealand.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">abused children</field><field name="subject">child abuse</field><field name="subject">investigation</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070430.162806</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterisation of hypothalamic leptin resistance during pregnancy in the rat</field><field name="creator">Ladyman, Sharon Rachel</field><field name="description">Leptin is primarily an adipose-derived hormone that acts in the hypothalamus to regulate body fat levels by suppressing appetite and increasing metabolic rate. Pregnancy is characterised by increased food intake and fat mass to meet the metabolic demands of this physiological state. Leptin concentrations also increase during pregnancy, but this does not prevent the pregnancy-induced hyperphagia, suggesting a state of leptin resistance. The aims of this thesis were to measure hypothalamic leptin responsiveness during pregnancy and to investigate the potential mechanisms underlying pregnancy-induced leptin resistance. 
 The satiety response to intracerebroventricular (i.c.v) leptin was measured in fasted non-pregnant (diestrous), early pregnant (day 7), and mid-pregnant (day 14) rats. Serial blood samples collected from another group of rats demonstrated that despite initial elevated plasma leptin concentrations in pregnant rats, fasting significantly decreased leptin concentrations so that pregnant and non-pregnant groups had similar, low leptin concentrations. Leptin treatment significantly reduced food intake in non-pregnant and early pregnant rats but not in mid-pregnant rats. In addition, there was no post-fasting hyperphagic response in the pregnant rats. These results indicate that pregnant rats become resistant to the satiety action of leptin. 
 To investigate the mechanisms underlying pregnancy-induced leptin resistance, leptin-induced activation of hypothalamic leptin-target neurons was examined. Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) phosphorylation was measured in non- pregnant and mid-pregnant rats following i.c.v. administration of leptin. Western blot and immunohistochemistry analysis indicated that leptin-induced STAT3 phosphorylation was significantly reduced in the ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus (VMH) during pregnancy. A suppression in the amount of leptin-induced STAT3 activation was observed in the arcuate nucleus during pregnancy, yet there was no overall change in the number of leptin responsive neurons compared to non-pregnant rats. This raises the possibility of a decrease in the degree of responsiveness of arcuate nucleus neurons to leptin during pregnancy. Using double-labelled immuno-histochemistry for alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone (&#945;-MSH) and leptin-induced pSTAT3 it was demonstrated that pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons remain responsive to leptin during pregnancy. In the VMH, consistent with the reduced pSTAT3, pregnancy also induced a 2-fold reduction in mRNA for the long form of the leptin receptor (Ob-Rb), the only isoform with full signal transduction capabilities. Expression of mRNA for one of the short forms of the leptin receptor (Ob-Ra) in the choroid plexus was decreased in early and late pregnancy, suggesting that reduced leptin transport into the brain may contribute to pregnancy-induced leptin resistance. CSF/plasma leptin concentration ratios did not differ between pregnant and non-pregnant rats however, suggesting unimpaired leptin transport during pregnancy. 
 These results indicate that pregnancy is a state of hypothalamic leptin resistance and is associated with impaired activation of the leptin-induced JAK/STAT3 signalling pathway in the VMH and arcuate nucleus, and reduced expression of Ob-Rb mRNA in the VMH. This state of leptin resistance represents an important adaptation of the maternal brain allowing increased food intake and fat mass so that the maternal body can meet the metabolic demands of pregnancy and prepare for the subsequent demands of lactation.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">leptin</field><field name="subject">hypothalamic hormones</field><field name="subject">pregnancy</field><field name="subject">metabolism</field><field name="subject">rats</field><field name="subject">physiology</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070427.154329</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An attempt to elucidate the role of GABAA receptors in vestibular compensation</field><field name="creator">Gliddon, C. M.</field><field name="description">Loss of sensory input from one vestibular labyrinth by unilateral vestibular deafferentation (UVD) results in a severe ocular motor (i.e., spontaneous nystagmus (SN)) and postural syndrome (i.e., yaw head tilt, (YHT) and roll head tilt (RHT)) which compensates over time in a behavioural recovery process known as vestibular compensation. It is generally accepted that the UVD-induced neuronal imbalance in the resting activity between the two vestibular nuclear complexes (VNCs) generates the ocular motor and postural syndrome and that the restoration of the resting activity in the ipsilateral VNC plays a causal role in the compensation of the static symptoms. &#947;-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) and the GABAA and GABAB receptors within the VNC are involved in normal vestibulo-ocular and --spinal pathways and it has been suggested that modification of GABAergic inhibition may be a mechanism responsible for the recovery of resting activity in the ipsilateral VNC. Behavioural, western blotting, and immunoassay techniques were used to address the role of the GABAA receptor in the VNC during vestibular compensation. 
 The first study involved the characterization of SN, YHT, and RHT compensation in guinea pigs that had been anaesthetized with isoflurane during the UVD. These animals compensated rapidly (i.e., 30 hrs) and the time to compensate was independent of the duration of the anaesthesia. Using the 30 hrs time frame, the effects of the chronic infusion of the GABAA receptor agonist (muscimol) / antagonist (gabazine) into either the ipsilateral or the contralateral VNC on the compensation of SN, YHT, and RHT, were determined. Infusion of muscimol (250, 500, and 750 ng) into the contralateral VNC and gabazine (31.25, 62.5 and 125 ng) into the ipsilateral VNC significantly affected YHT and RHT (p &lt; 0.05), but not their rate of compensation (p &gt; 0.05). Interestingly, the effects of muscimol and gabazine on YHT and RHT were consistent throughout the first 30 hrs post-UVD. At 30 hrs post-UVD, the pumps were disconnected. In both experimental groups, the value and direction of the YHT and RHT returned to vehicle levels. Infusion of muscimol (62.5, 125, and 250 ng) into the ipsilateral VNC and gabazine (125, 375, and 750 ng) into the contralateral VNC had little effect on YHT and RHT, or their rate of compensation. At 30 hrs post-UVD, the pumps were disconnected. In both experimental groups, the value and direction of the YHT and RHT returned to vehicle levels. These results suggest that the ipsilateral gabazine and contralateral muscimol infusions were modifying the expression of the symptoms without altering the mechanism of compensation. Furthermore, the mechanism responsible for vestibular compensation can cope with the both the GABAA receptor-mediated and the UVD-induced decrease in resting activity. Results from the western blotting study indicated that compensation of SN, YHT, and RHT is not associated with changes in the protein levels of the GABAA receptor &#945;&#8321;, &#946;&#8322;, or &#947;&#8322; subunits. Compensation of SN, YHT, and RHT is associated with an elevation in cortisol salivary levels. Overall, the results suggest that the GABAA receptors are involved in the expression of YHT and RHT, but not in the mechanism that is responsible for their compensation.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">GABA</field><field name="subject">receptors</field><field name="subject">vestibular apparatus</field><field name="subject">labyrinth (ear)</field><field name="subject">diseases</field><field name="subject">nystagmus</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070427.150754</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Culture, language and translation issues in educational assessment : Maori immersion students in the National Education Monitoring Project</field><field name="creator">Pereira, Janet Aileen</field><field name="description">1999 was the first year that Year 8 Maori immersion students were included in national monitoring in New Zealand. The thesis explores how bilingualism, being a second language learner, and culture impact on student performance. It details the National Education Monitoring Project&#65533;s (NEMP) efforts to create fair and valid cross-language and cross-culture assessment. The thesis looks at overseas research on the development, translation and administration of tasks and relates this to NEMP&#65533;s processes. Issues and problems that arose during the development, translation and administration of tasks are discussed. 
 Several positions emerge from this thesis. Firstly, that despite the problems encountered, there were some clear &#65533;benefits&#65533;. Benefits lay primarily in: recognition of the complexity of cross-language and cross-cultural assessment, &#65533;improved&#65533; assessment and translation processes, professional development, new understanding and knowledge areas, identification of areas for future research and the accumulation of data (albeit in some instances problematic). Secondly, that NEMP went to great efforts to consult with and involve Maori. However, the relationship between NEMP and Maori was compromised in that some sectors within immersion education were ambivalent about participating in national monitoring. This ambivalence impacted in a number of ways on the project and the assessment of immersion students. Thirdly, that the inclusion of immersion students in national monitoring needs to be seen within the wider social, political and historical context of New Zealand. Assessment is not a neutral process. Assessment is a social and political activity that has the potential to advantage certain groups in society and disadvantage others. 
 Fourthly, despite NEMP&#65533;s efforts to be fair, inclusive and thorough in its processes there were significant issues that compromised students&#65533; performance and the quality of the information gathered. Limited language skills of some students, cultural differences, translation and task administration problems at times worked to the disadvantage of immersion students and raise questions about the validity of some findings. Finally, I suggest that the inclusion of Maori immersion students in national monitoring is in some respects premature and unfair. In particular, questions need to be asked about the fairness and validity of making comparisons between bilingual, second language learners in Maori immersion settings and monolingual Maori students learning in English in the mainstream.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">education</field><field name="subject">matauranga</field><field name="subject">immersion</field><field name="subject">kura kaupapa</field><field name="subject">assessment</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070516.152005</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Maori language integration in the age of information technology: a computational approach</field><field name="creator">Laws, Mark R.</field><field name="description">A multidisciplinary approach that involves language universals, linguistic discourse analysis and computer information technology are combined to support the descriptive nature of this research dissertation. Utilising comparative methods to determine rudimentary language structures which reflect both the scientific and historic parameters that are embedded in all languages. From a hypothesis to the proof of concept, a multitude of computer applications have been used to test these language models, templates and frameworks. To encapsulate this entire approach, it is best described as "designing then building the theoretical, experimental, and practical projects that form the structural network of the Maori language system". The focus on methods for integrating the language is to investigate shared characteristics between Maori and New Zealand English. This has provided a complete methodology for a bilingual based system. A system with text and speech for language generation and classification. This approach has looked at existing computational linguistic and information processing techniques for the analysis of each language&#65533;s phenomena; where data from basic units to higher-order linguistic knowledge has been analysed in terms of their characteristics for similar and/or dissimilar features. The notion that some language units can have similar acoustic sounds, structures or even meanings in other languages is plausible. How these are identified was the key concept to building an integrated language system. This research has permitted further examination into developing a new series of phonological and lexical self organising maps of Maori. Using phoneme and word maps spatially organised around lower to higher order concepts such as &#65533;sounds like&#65533;. To facilitate the high demands placed on very large data stores, the further development of the speech database management system containing phonological, phonetic, lexical, semantic, and other language frameworks was also developed. This database has helped to examine how effectively Maori has been fully integrated into an existing English framework. The bilingual system will allow full interaction with a computer-based speech architecture. This will contribute to the existing knowledge being constructed by the many different disciplines associated with languages; naturally or artificially derived. Evolving connectionist systems are new tools that are trained in an unsupervised manner to be both adaptable and flexible. This hybrid approach is an improvement on past methods in the development of more effective and efficient ways for solving applied problems for speech data analysis, classification, rule extraction, information retrieval and knowledge acquisition. A preliminary study will apply bilingual data to an &#65533;evolving clustering method&#65533; algorithm that returns a structure containing acoustic clusters plotted using visualisation techniques. In the true practical sense, the complete bilingual system has had a bi-directional approach. Both languages have undergone similar data analysis, language modelling, data access, text and speech processing, and human-computer network interface interaction.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori language</field><field name="subject">te reo Maori</field><field name="subject">computational linguistics</field><field name="subject">computer program language</field><field name="subject">information technology</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070517.123300</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Temporomandibular joint pathological changes in the prehistoric New Zealand Maori and Moriori</field><field name="creator">Latimer, Christopher Paul</field><field name="description">Diseases and disorders of the temporomandibular joint are commonly encountered clinically. This has lead to most temporomandibular research focusing upon the pathologies that affect the joint and their proposed aetiologies. Little of this research has been conucted on the prehistoric Polynesians. Therefore, this study was developed in order to determine the type and pattern of any temporomandibular pathologies in the prehistoric Maori and Moriori and to investigate their possible aetiologies.
	For this study a sample of 89 prehistoric Maori and Moriori skulls were used. All temporomandibular pathologies were recorded by type, location, and severity. Where possible, the ecological and geographical provenance of each individual was recorded and their sex and age estimated. This enabled an analysis of whether the prevalence and severity of temporomandibular degeneration varied between provenances or sexes, and if the occurrence of temporomandibular pathology increased with age. The condition of the dentition was also recorded for each individual as the dentition has been implicated in many previous studies to be an aetiological factor in temporomandibular degeneration. The dental conditions examined include; tooth attrition, inflammation of infection of the alveolar bone, dental caries, and fern root planes. Finally, the presence of any congenital or developmental anomalies and condylar enthesophytes were recorded in order to investigate if these conditions had any relationship to the occurrence of temporomandibular degeneration.
	A high prevalence of temporomandibular degenerative joint disease was found in this sample. No primary relationship was seen between age, congenital or developmental anomalies, condylar enthesophytes and temporomandibular degeneration. Furthermore, despite a high proportion of these individuals having very worn teeth, with consequent infection and tooth loss, no primary relationships were found between the selected dental conditions and temporomandibular degeneration either. However, a significant association was found between the selected dental conditions and temporomandibular degeneration either. A significant association was found between the sex of the individual and temporomandibular pathology, with males being more frequently and severely affected than the females. This appeared to be due differences in dietary type between the sex of the individual and temporomandibular pathology, with males being more frequently and severely affected than the females. This appeared to be due to differences in dietary type between the sexes resulting in more severe biomechanical degeneration recorded may be caused by excessive biomechanical loading possibly resulting from the diet or as a consequence of the Polynesian morphology. Interestingly, over one third of the sample had grooving in at least one fossae. It is proposed that this grooving may have either a hereditary component, or result from a specific morphological variation that is present in the prehistoric Maori and Moriori.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">Moriori</field><field name="subject">paleopathology</field><field name="subject">pathophysiology.</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070517.125434</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Te Waka! Life histories of two contemporary Polynesian voyaging canoes</field><field name="creator">Kottmann, Ilka</field><field name="description">This thesis concerns the life-histories of the two contemporary Polynesian vovaging canoes from Aotearoa New Zealand. It documents the background, construction and voyages of Hawaiki Nui (1979 - 1986) built by Matahi Whakataka-Brightwell and Te Aurere (1992 - 1998) built by Hekenukumai Puhipi Busby. It also highlights the historical and cultural significance of waka for Maori and other indigenous Pacific peoples.
	Based on my field work as a participant in Maori voyaging between 1996 and 1998, I argue that this revival of waka voyaging reaffirms the cultural identities of contemporary Maori and other Polynesians. The case studies of Hawaiki Nui and Te Aurere confirm the ongoing significance of waka not only in Aotearoa New Zealand, but Pacific-wide. Contemporary Polynesian waka voyaging is historically significant as it revives unique Polynesian skills, such as traditional waka-building, navigation and sailing techniques. It is also culturally significant, as it reinforces central Maori (and Polynesian) cultural concepts, such as whakapapa (genealogy ties) and whanaungatanga (sense of belonging).
	At a time when Maori(as well as other indigenous Pacific peoples) are constantly negotiating and redefining their cultural boundaries within their respective socio-political contexts, Polynesian voyaging waka are reappearing as a strong symbol of Pacific Islanders&#65533; cultural identities. As a symbol of a shared seafaring past they create timeless platforms for Maori and other Polynesians to negotiate the boundaries of their cultures.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">Pacific</field><field name="subject">waka</field><field name="subject">canoes and canoeing</field><field name="subject">Polynesian navigation</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070517.130329</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Demography of Procellariids: model complexity, chick quality, and harvesting</field><field name="creator">Hunter, Christine M</field><field name="description">Many challenges still exist in the empirical measurement of population size or density of burrow-nesting procellariiforms. Although reasonable precision of burrow occupancy estimates can be achieved with 10-15 transect (20 entrances per transect) per site, unknown levels of bias in burrow occupancy estimates currently prevents reliable estimation of burrow-nesting procellariiform abundance or harvest rates. Because it is unlikely that biases in burrow occupancy are similar among colonies, valid comparisons among sites may require estimates of absolute abundance rather than relative measures of burrow occupancy.
	The reliability and precision of matrix models for procellariids will depend primarily on the reliability and precision of adult survival estimates. Sensitivities, elasticities and uncertainties of population growth rate to demographic parameters for models with differing structures and parameterisations showed an overwhelming importance of adult survival in determining population growth rate and results of perturbation analyses. Estimates of adult survival should be a primary focus of any procellariid research program involving assessment of population status, or questions of population response to perturbations.
	Juvenile survival, pre-breeder survival and emigration rates were also shown to be relatively important in determining population growth rate and perturbation analyses. The sensitivity and elasticity of population growth rate to survival rates for all immature stages combined were similar in magnitude to the sensitivity and elasticity of population growth rate to survival rates for fecund birds. Estimation of survival rates for immature birds should also be given high priority in procellariid research programs. The variability in these parameters among populations needs to be assessed if results are to be generalised beyound specific colonies from which parameters are estimated.
	There is evidence that selective harvest of heavier Titi chicks occurs on at least some islands. However, analyses of a demographic model incorporating different quality chicks showed even extremely high degrees of selective harvest had little influence on population growth rate or perturbation analyses unless overall harvest levels were very high.
	Comparison of population growth rate and perturbation analyses of models differing in the level of detail in parameterisation or in the number of stages included in the model, showed negligible differences in results. This suggests that simple models, even if based on only sparse data, are adequate to set research priorities and evaluate population response to perturbations such as for the assessment of conservation management options, evaluation of possible causes of population change and assessment of the effects of harvest.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Titi</field><field name="subject">Muttonbird</field><field name="subject">Procellariids</field><field name="subject">breeding</field><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">hunting</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070518.110942</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Are New Zealand Treaty of Waitangi settlements achieving justice? : the Ngai Tahu settlement and the return of Pounamu (greenstone)</field><field name="creator">Kay-Gibbs, Meredith</field><field name="description">Achieving &#65533;justice&#65533; is the overriding aim of the Treaty settlement process. This process was established to resolve Maori historical grievances against the New Zealand Crown for alleged breaches of the Treaty of Waitangi. Because historical injustices involve the interactions of cultures over time, justice in the Treaty settlement process is shaped, and constrained, by two main factors: &#65533;culture&#65533; and &#65533;time&#65533;. The settlement of Ngai Tahu&#65533;s historical grievances, and in particular the return of pounamu as part of the settlement, achieved a large measure of this limited kind of justice. The Ngai Tahu settlement and the return of pounamu suggest that Treaty settlements are achieving, and may continue to achieve, a large measure of the justice available in the Treaty settlement process.
	Examination of the return of pounamu to Ngai Tahu reveals, however, that new injustices may have been created in the Ngai Tahu settlement. These new injustices are critically analysed, and recommendations for maximising justice in the Treaty settlement process are suggested. If Treaty settlements are to achieve the maximum justice available in the Treaty settlement process, the Treaty partners must heed the warning signs arising from the possible creation of new injustices in the Ngai Tahu settlement.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Kai Tahu</field><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">Treaty of Waitangi</field><field name="subject">Waitangi Tribunal</field><field name="subject">land tenure</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070518.111541</field></doc><doc><field name="title">"An indolent and chilly folk" : the development of the idea of the "Moriori myth"</field><field name="creator">Clayworth, Peter</field><field name="description">Throughout the nineteenth century probably the majority of Pakeha held the view that the East Polynesian ancestors of the Maori were the first people to settle in New Zealand. Over the same period there were always considerable numbers of Pakeha who held the alternative view that an earlier people were already living in New Zealand when the first East Polynesian immigrants arrived. Among Maori each hapu and iwi had their own origin traditions. Some held that their ancestors arrived to an empty land, while others believed there were other groups already here when their own ancestors arrived. The traditions of the Chatham Island Moriori indicated that they were also East Polynesian migrants, but some Pakeha speculated that the Moriori were a distinct people from the Maori.
	By the early twentieth century one set of ideas on early settlement had become the orthodox view of the past among Pakeha. This view, which held sway from the 1910s until at least the 1960s, maintained that the original people of New Zealand were the &#65533;Moriori&#65533;, a people only distantly related, if at all, to the Maori. This primitive early people were supposed to have been displaced by the arrival of the more advanced East Polynesian Maori. Some of the more fortunate Moriori were absorbed into the Maori tribes, while the majority were either killed or driven into exile on the Chatham Islands. This idea of the past, sometimes called the &#65533;Moriori Myth&#65533;, has now been largely rejected by scholars, but still holds some currency in popular circles.
	The current thesis examines the question of how the &#65533;Moriori Myth&#65533; developed and eventually became the orthodox view of the past. This question is investigated in the contexts of British imperial expansion, of the development of scientific ideas on race and evolution, and of the study of language and folklore as a way to decipher racial history. The current thesis is largely based on the writings of Pakeha and Maori scholars of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Letters and manuscripts, in both English and Maori, have been used, along with published books and papers. The major focus of the work is the idea that the Moriori Myth largely developed out of the Pakeha study of Maori oral history. This study of oral history led to a considerable degree of interaction between Pakeha scholars and Maori experts.
	A major focus in the early part of the work is on Pakeha attempts to determine the racial identity and history of the Chatham Island Moriori. In this part of the work considerable attention has been paid to the collaborative work of the Pakeha scholar Alexander Shand and the Moriori expert Hirawanu Tapu, who worked together to record the surviving Moriori traditions.
	The focus of the latter part of this thesis is on the creation by Pakeha scholars of theoretical models of the early migrations to New Zealand, based on their understandings of Maori oral traditions. It will be argued that the &#65533;Moriori Myth&#65533; was largely based on the writings of Stephenson Percy Smith, as promoted by himself and Elsdon Best, through the medium of the knowledge network formed by the Polynesian Society. Smith&#65533;s writings on the &#65533;Moriori Myth&#65533; will be shown to have been largely based on his interpretations of the writings of the Ngati Kahungunu scholar Hoani Turei Whatahoro. It will be argued that the &#65533;Moriori Myth&#65533; was in fact the creation of interactions between Pakeha scholars and Maori experts rather than the invention of any one person or group.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Moriori</field><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">ethnology</field><field name="subject">origin</field><field name="subject">history</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070518.112910</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Rapua te ora : a role for budget holding in the provision of public health services for Maori.</field><field name="creator">Waldon, John Allan</field><field name="description">Maori health development advanced with the Hui Taumata (1984) and with the emergence of by Maori for Maori health service delivery. Rapua te ora, by Maori for Maori health service delivery. Rapua te ora, by Maori for Maori health service delivery is an expression of tino rangatiratanga. The case study of budget holding presents a Maori analysis of contemporary health services delivery to meet the needs of Maori. Maori engage in research as dynamic participants who define their roles. Maori provide new analyses of health whilst adding to the diversity of views within health research, health services administration, and health services management.
	Nested case study method is used to prepare this thesis. Methods nested within the case study are a literature review; empowerment evaluation, information systems strategy, provider profile method, and structural analysis. Kaupapa Maori theory, which underpins the Maori centered research approach, is used to ensure the research objectives are relevant and meet needs of Maori.
	Budget holding is a mechanism for provider development, systematically linking national public health oblectives to local and regional needs. At different levels of development Maori providers, new to public health, require careful anf thoughtful administration, where necessary, thoughtful management. The benefits for administrating the provision of public health services for Maori are clear vertical accountability to the purchaser, clear local accountabilities, and provider development consistent with local Maori health needs.
	Conclusions drawn from this case study are that Maori provider development is a response to health reforms characterised by multiple transformations of health service funding. Provider development and meeting disparate accountabilities are important issues for sustainability and the development of Maori providers for public health, and are applicable to the wider community, both national and international.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">health</field><field name="subject">hauora</field><field name="subject">kaupapa Maori</field><field name="subject">medical care</field><field name="subject">health services administration</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070518.113509</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Making news at Pakaitore: a multi-sighted ethnography</field><field name="creator">Tait, Sue</field><field name="description">As a public medium and a vehicle of "culture", which frames and comprehends social priorities, relations and identities, news has received scant anthropological attention (Spitulnik 1993).
	Whanganui Iwi&#65533;s occupation of Moutoa Gardens in 1995 was made available to a public as "news". My project reveals a range of exclusions around these mediations, which conjure wider issues regarding the production of representations within (post) colonial contexts. As a contribution to anthropology, my ethnography responds to the limitations of traditional ethnographic praxis, providing a productive response to criticisms of the discipline and revealing the public value of ethnographic sensibilities.
	Whanganui Iwi believed the Gardens to be the historical site of Pakaitore pa. The area was reclaimed as a marae, shelters were built, the perimeter fenced, and Iwi lived on site for 80 days. The initiative constituted an expression of Iwi&#65533;s experiences of exteriority within Wanganui and their frustration with the delay of the Crown&#65533;s response to their claims alleging breaches of Treaty of Waitangi. Iwi temporarily inverted their relationship to the Pakeha community by establishing a literal boundary to the marae, which rendered those who were not supportive of Iwi aspirations "outsiders". While access to the marae was controlled, and restrictions were placed on news workers, the only group banned from the marae were the employees of the city&#65533;s newspaper, the Wanganui Chronicle.
	My project details the production of news about Pakaitore, and the attempts of Iwi to control their representation; specifying the role of "location" (both spatial and ideological) in the production of written and photographic accounts (Haraway 1991). I examine how the structures of news production are deployed and contested by news workers, and the manner in which news texts may or may not be "inhabited" by their subjects and public.
	I compare the journalistic practices of Chronicle workers, prior to and following their ban, with those of out of town newsworkers from press and television. The mechanisms, codes, and values of what makes "good" news structure particular locations for news workers, and this largely precluded conveying the intention and experience of nga Iwi at Pakaitore. This extended to the reports gathered by the reporter for TVNZ (the state owned broadcaster), who, as Iwi wha&#772;nau, was allowed unfettered access to the marae.
	Being "the news" interfered with agendas inside the marae. From this location, Pakaitore was about building relationships between hapu and strengthening a sense of community. Hui addressed the status of Iwi within Wanganui, and rangatahi and visitors were educated in tribal history and tikanga. These priorities contest the "outside" perspective that Pakaitore was simply an attempt to antagonise Pakeha authorities.
	Throughout the course of my fieldwork visual aspects of media representations of Pakaitore were cited by a range of my informants as conveying particular authority. In some contexts this was by way of revealing the "truth" about the threat of protest to social cohesion, while in others it provided evidence for the media&#65533;s inability to represent the initiative in a manner that was sympathetic to, or representative of, Iwi whanau. I argue that the privileging of the disembodied visual reproduces myths of "otherness", covering over experiences of embodied "difference" and the history which renders activism intelligible.
	My project reveals that in Aotearoa/New Zealand, those contesting the Pakeha imaginary of a "post-racist" culture are cast as producing racial disharmony.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">press coverage</field><field name="subject">land tenure</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070518.114514</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Planning for the cultural landscape : from mountains to the sea : a Maori perspective</field><field name="creator">Sims, Miranda</field><field name="description">For Maori the cultural landscape is the foundation of traditional, historical and spiritual values and is fundamental to their cultural ideology. It is the relationship between people and the land that bestows Maori with a sense of cultural identity and belonging. At present the cultural landscape is under increasing pressure from inappropriate development, resulting not only in the destruction of the physical landscape but also defilement of associated intrinsic values.
	Planning for Maori cultural landscape values at the district level is challenging, with limited sucess in curbing landscape degradation under a dominant western planning regime. This study examines the planning process incorporating the cultural landscape values of Maori within the context of the Dunedin district. An overview of cultural landscape significance is provided. The study also assesses the current measures employed onto the landscape. The study also assesses the current measures employed for protecting the cultural landscape and offers recommendations for improving the integration of cultural landscape values into the planning process, both at a general level and with particular reference to three case studies of culturally significant landscapes in Dunedin.
	A combination of in-depth interviews with local Maori and Dunedin City Council planners, literature review, district plan content analysis and case studies established that current protection measures engaged by the Dunedin City Council are insufficient and lack the specificity required for adequate cultural landscape protection. A general lack of comprehension regarding cultural landscape meaning amongst planners was also found.
	It is recommended that cultural landscape planning extends beyond statutory requirements to adopt a collaborative approach, with Maori having a more significant role in the planning process. Three main recommendations for future management of the cultural landscape are provided: identification, co-management and public education. Together these recommendations promote a move towards a planning system with a greater bi-cultural focus. Improved protection provisions in planning will ensure the continuation and enhancement of the Maori cultural landscape into the future, as part of New Zealand&#65533;s heritage.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">Kai Tahu</field><field name="subject">landscape assessment</field><field name="subject">regional planning</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070518.115102</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Maori girls, power, physical education, sport, and play : "being hungus, hori, and hoha"</field><field name="creator">Palmer, Farah Rangikoepa</field><field name="description">This research investigated how meanings associated with race, gender, and class relations in New Zealand mainstream schools are produced, reproduced, and challenged within the arenas of school sport, physical education, and physical activity. The study focused specifically on Maori girls&#65533; and young Maori women&#65533;s experiences in these arenas in order to determine how race, gender, and class identities interact, and also provided Maori girls and young women with an opportunity to be heard in research. The effects of historical and contemporary discourses, polices, and practices in New Zealand sport and school were reviewed. Theoretical perspectives and methodologies such as critical theory, kaupapa Maori research, feminism, postmodernism, and cultural studies informed the research. Qualitative methods of study such as critical ethnography, document analysis, participant observation, semi-structured interviews, and self-reflective diaries were used in order to observe, investigate, and empower the Maori girls and women, teachers, and the school involved. By utilising social reproduction concepts such as hegemony (Gramsci), discourse (Foucault), and cultural capital (Bourdieu), initiatives in schools that related to Maori girls and young women were investigated at three different levels; the fantasy discourse level, the implementation level, and the reality discourse level. The many identities and ideologies of those involved in the transformation from fantasy to reality had an effect on what was ultimately produced, reproduced, and challenged. These were also implicit and explicit ideologies operating in school sport, physical education, and physical activity arenas that worked to reproduce gendered dualisms, racial stereotypes, and class differentiation. By focusing on power relations at the structural and personal level, instances where Maori girls and young women practised &#65533;power over&#65533; others, or the &#65533;power to act&#65533; were discussed. Maori concepts such as whakaiti, whakamaa, whakahiihii, tautoko, aawhina, and manaaki, as well as more colloquial terms such as being hungus, hori, and hoha highlighted the attitudes, values, beliefs and behaviours of participants involved in the study and were used to inform the different levels of analysis. Difficulties in closing the gap between what was hoped for and what actually happened were discussed, and political and practical implications were suggested.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">youth</field><field name="subject">young women</field><field name="subject">school sports</field><field name="subject">recreation</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070518.115626</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Maori work related fatal injury, 1985-1994</field><field name="creator">McCracken, Selwyn</field><field name="description">Although already known that Maori were over-represented in terms of Work-Related Fatal Injury, because of flawed identification processes, both in numerator and denominator data, little progress has been made in understanding the true extent, nature and distribution of work-related fatal injury among Maori. The present study aimed to more accurately describe the problem, identifying specific circumstances associated with Maori deaths that will assist in developing preventive strategies for Maori.
	Coronial files with an ICD 9-CM E-Code between E800 and E989 and a decedent aged 15-84, were reviewed as part of the study of all New Zealand work-related fatal injuries occurring between 1985 and 1994. Basic descriptive and causal information concerning each incident were abstracted and coded. Maori were identified within this dataset by either the classification recorded upon death certificates or if they were identified as Maori within Coroners files.
	In all, 91 Maori deaths were identified within the 817 work-related fatalities. Notably, agreement between the data sources used to identify ethnic status was only around 52%. Crude rates were significantly higher for Maori and did not show the significant linear decline across years, compared with the non-Maori rates. Rates adjusted for employment patterns based on ethnicity did not differ. Specific event sequences leading to death were examined by age industry and occupational group for both Maori and non-Maori workers.
	This study is the first to specifically investigate work-related injury for Maori. It confirms that overall inequities exist, and that they are largely due to differing employment patterns between Maori and non-Maori.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">occupational mortality</field><field name="subject">industrial accidents</field><field name="subject">wounds and injuries</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070522.132250</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Trans-Tasman migration and Maori in the time of AIDS.</field><field name="creator">Aspin, S.C. (Stanley Clive)</field><field name="description">At the dawn of the new millennium, migration has been identified as a crucial element in the ongoing HIV/AIDS epidemic yet few studies have been carried out into the specific ways in which migration is able to fuel the epidemic. Since the beginning of the epidemic in the 1980s we have witnessed increasing mobility of people throughout the world, with migration being a major factor in the ongoing transmission of HIV in particular regions of the world.
	This study looks at the particular of migration that exists between New Zealand and Australia and examines the effects that this has had on a group of Maori gay men and transsexuals during the time of the HIV/AIDS epidemic. In particular, the study examines the effects that trans-Tasman migration has on identity and sexual practice and the implications that this has for HIV prevention among the Maori gay and transsexual communities of both countries.
	In order to examine the relationship between trans-Tasman migration, identity and behaviour, in-depth interviews were conducted with two groups of Maori gay man and transsexuals. One group resided permanently in Sydney, Australia (n=13) and the other group had returned to live in New Zealand after having lived in Sydney for at least one year (n=11). During the interviews respondents were invited to talk about their cultural and sexual identity, their upbringing, their reasons for migrating to Sydney and their sexual practice in Sydney.
	Analysis of the interviews showed that there were distinct differences in the two groups of respondents. While the Sydney gay community offered a haven for Maori migrants from New Zealand, this was sometimes at the expense of a compromised sense of cultural identity as well as exposure to racism, violence and prejudice from living in a predominantly white middle class society. In contrast, those who had returned to live in New Zealand had a stronger sense of their cultural identity than those who resided long-term in Sydney as well as ongoing access to a cultural context which reaffirmed and supported their sense of Maori identity. At the same time, those who lived in Sydney were more likely to report risk behaviour associated with the transmission of HIV than did those who lived in New Zealand.
	This project concludes that Maori gay men and transsexuals who have a strong sense of their cultural identity may be at a lower risk of HIV infection than those who do not. These findings have significant implications for the design and implementation of HIV prevention programmes both in New Zealand and in Sydney. Such programmes need to acknowledge the cultural diversity of the gay community and must provide the means whereby community members, especially those from minority groups, may have ongoing access to cultural structures which support and reaffirm their sexual as well as their cultural identity.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">epidemiology</field><field name="subject">AIDS</field><field name="subject">male homosexuality</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070522.134607</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Stone tool production at Cat's Eye Point, Kakanui, North Otago, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Wilson, Amanda J</field><field name="description">This thesis examines a lithic assemblage from Cat&#65533;s Eye Point (J42/4), Kakanui, North Otago, New Zealand. This archaic site was excavated during 1996 and 1997 and the lithic assemblage was collected from 41m&#65533; excavated during these two seasons. Previous studies of lithic material from New Zealand and the Pacific are reviewed to indicate the range of information that can be gained from lithic analysis. Themes of research in the North Otago region are also examined to place Cat&#65533;s Eye Point into its regional context.
	This thesis had three main areas of investigation. The first involved a descriptive and technological analysis of the debitage using mass flake analysis (MFA) and individual flake analysis (IFA). Formal artefacts, such as hammerstones, blanks, and performs, were also examined. Secondly, spatial analysis was used to determine if the lithic assemblage could be used to infer intra-site activity areas. This was conducted by analysing macro- (flakes larger than 3mm) and microdebitage (flakes less than 3mm) by examining the range of material types. The third area of investigation examined debitage recovered from 6.4mm (1/4 inch) and 3.2mm (1/8 inch) sieves to determine if any significant technological information was gained by debitage from the 3.2mm sieve.
	The conclusions of this study indicate that there were two methods of basalt cobble reduction at Cat&#65533;s Eye Point for adze production. Adze production at Cat&#65533;s Eye Point was opportunistic and the non-local material curated. The results of the debitage analysis indicate that the entire sequence of adze manufacture did not occur in the excavated area of Cat&#65533;s Eye Point and the initial cobble reduction probably occurred on the adjacent beach where the cobbles are found today. Consequently, coastal rock outcrops, even without evidence of associated debitage, must be viewed as potential sources of rock for stone tool manufacture unless determined otherwise. The spatial analysis detected two activity areas and a disposal area at Cat&#65533;s Eye Point. The analysis of the 6.4mm and 3.2mm debitage found that no significant technological information was gained by examining the smaller flakes.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">Kai Tahu</field><field name="subject">stone implements</field><field name="subject">tools</field><field name="subject">antiquities</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070523.143909</field></doc><doc><field name="title">"Te Tahi o Pipiri" : Literacy and missionary pedagogy as mechanisms in change.

Protectorates and &#65533;the colonies&#65533; reflected imperialist ideals, expansion, territory, external revenue and power. Missionaries were the footmen of colonial policy. The relations forged between these evangelists and the indigene have been thoroughly studied and scrutinised. However, reported interaction has been about missionaries and the &#65533;native&#65533;, with less about that between the indigenes, individual and tribe, elder and young. The thesis intends to redress this imbalance in the Bay of Islands from 1814 to 1834.
	The following work is an examination of a process of social change in Aotearoa. In the early 19th century the physical, spiritual and intellectual contact made between Maori peoples and the European explorers, scientists, and missionaries involved a deliberate cultural entanglement. It is the processes of acculturation, assimilation, or simply misunderstanding that are of interest. The study will have several foci involving the reaction of peoples of the Bay of Islands to the missionary institution of religious education. Chapter One addresses the theoretical location of the peoples that interacted in the Bay, while the second chapter is a brief description of a Maori coastal society prior to the arrival of literate missionaries. Chapter Three is about the cultural and social engagements of Ruatara, Marsden, Kendall and Hongi. The final chapter is a biographical exploration in the life of Rawiri Tawhanga and his interactions with missionaries and Maori of the Bay. Fundamentally it is the indigenous interaction during the initial periods of external European contact and, therefore, the effects of internal societal change that the author wishes to examine.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">Bay of Islands</field><field name="subject">missionaries</field><field name="subject">history</field><field name="subject">social interaction</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070523.144700</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An evaluation of bicultural initiatives performed in tertiary departments of psychology in Aotearoa</field><field name="creator">Skipper, Rueben Ngariki</field><field name="description">In the past psychology has been criticised for its mono-cultural nature and insensitivity when dealing with Maori clients and students. As a consequence university departments of psychology have sought to address these issues by incorporating the ideology of biculturalism into its operations. The aim of the study was to evaluate the bicultural developments occurring within these departments by assessing the type and effectiveness of bicultural initiatives. A questionnaire designed to assess bicultural initiatives, attitudes and, intentions was sent to academic staff within university psychology departments in New Zealand. Northern departments displayed significantly greater commitment to bicultural progress than southern departments with northern academics performing initiatives (e.g., &#65533;established a committee of staff and students to promote bicultural perspectives and interpret and apply bicultural policy&#65533;) more often and of higher commitment than southern academics. Overall, within psychology departments very little bicultural progress has occurred except in the most northern departments. However, the effectiveness of many initiatives is debateable with tokenistic initiativeness predominant in most departments. The qualitative analysis of participant comments identified academic justification for bicultural inaction within departments. This was displayed in various themes: multiculturalism versus biculuralism, psychology being an a cultural science, Maori self-determination being separatism akin to apartheid, the relevance of the Treaty of Waitangi to psychology, and Backlash. Two main reasons for these findings are discussed; (1) lack of knowledge of Maori issues and, (2) racism.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Biculturalism</field><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">psychology</field><field name="subject">study and teaching</field><field name="subject">universities and colleges</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070523.145218</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Maori identity: change and contemporary challenges</field><field name="creator">Rawson, Lisette C</field><field name="description">Maori identity has changed as a result of many factors including colonisation, assimilation and social change. Traditional Maori identity is constructed within whanau, hapu and iwi relations. As Maori have moved away from traditional iwi areas, the traditional forms of identification as Maori have been challenged. Maori whanau with at least two generations present, were interviewed using open-ended questions. Interviews were then transcribed and coded to ascertain important features of Maori identity. This research shows that Maori participants identified with most of the traditional forms of Maoridom such as the importance of land, language, whakapapa and traditions. The Treaty of Waitangi has become a form of identification for some Maori, particularly urban Maori. There were also some differences between generations within whanau and between rural and urban Maori. Grounded theory was used within the scope of this research as it was deemed to be more reflective of Maori realities than conventional (i.e., Western) psychological theories.
	Maori participants indicated concern with some themes within New Zealand society that have a negative impact on Maori identity. Social expectations, negative stereotypes and commercialism were major concerns for Maori. Issues with education, power, money and finance and politics were also deemed of great concern and a threat to a positive Maori identity. Participants also commented on the need for more positive role models for young Maori and the need for bicultural initiatives to improve Maori and Pakeha relations.

In this wide ranging &#65533;interrogation&#65533;, I will employ a dialectical method of analysis where each of the major Articles of the Treaty are assigned a particular &#65533;role&#65533; in the Thesis because it represents the central &#65533;University&#65533; or Kawanatanga Problematic; that Article 2 (Tino Rangatiratanga-Chieftainship) is the Antithesis because it represents the &#65533;Maori&#65533; contradiction or the Tino Rangatiratanga Mandate; and that Article 3 (Kotahitanga-Unity and Association) is the Synthesis because it represents Treaty Praxis&#65533; or the Kotahitanga Solution.
	This study (like the Treaty) has been organised into five appropriate Parts:
	Part A (The Preamble) provides the overture for the study, and, as such, contextualises the methodological framework and theoretical paradigms in, on and around which the rest of the study is located.
	Part B (The Kawanatanga Problematic) will attempt to articulate the struggle of Maori Studies in academia by problematising Kawanatanga (as is the case in most of the scholarship on this critical aspect of the Treaty).
	Part C (The Tino Rangatiratanga Mandate) will outline three major neglected areas of Tino Rangatiratanga in academia: such as the agency of Maori staff, students and communities; and the status of language and of knowledge taonga (treasures).
	Part D (The Kotahitanga Solution) will attempt to synthesise Treaty praxis within the debate by outlining and evaluating a number of Treaty principles and examples.
	Part E (Post-Script) will summarise the personified (signatory) aspects of the study and will also attempt to articulate a possible future for Maori Studies.
	It is hoped that the analytical framework employed in this study and will also attempt to articulate a possible future for Maori Studies.
	It is hoped that the analytical framework employed in this study will assist in clarfying (i) the nature of the struggle of a &#65533;minority-culture&#65533; subject (Maori Studies) within (ii) a &#65533;majority-culture&#65533; institution (the University), and (iii) the promise of bicultural synthesis (or Treaty praxis) as a means of mediating this struggle.

Why is there such a focus on &#65533;historical&#65533; drama in these countries at the end of the twentieth century and what does this drama contribute to wider debates about post-colonial history? This thesis aims both to explore the connections between drama and history, and to analyse the interface between live and recorded drama.
	In order to discuss these issues, I have used the work of theatre and film critics and historians, supplemented by reference to writers working in the field of post-colonial and performance theory. In particular, I have utilised the methods of Helen Gilbert and Joanne Tompkins in Post-Colonial Drama: Theory, Practice, Politics, beginning with their claim that in the post-colonial situation history has been seen to determine reality itself. I have also drawn on theorists such as Michel Foucault, Linda Hutcheon and Guy Debord who question the &#65533;truth&#65533; value of official history-writing and emphasize the role of representation in determining popular perceptions of the past. This discussion is developed through reference to contemporary performance theory, particularly the work of Richard Schechner and Marvin Carlson, in order to suggest that there is no clear separation between performance and reality, and that access to history is only possible through re-enactments of it, whether in written or performative forms.
	Chapter One is a survey of the development of &#65533;historical&#65533; drama in theatre and film from New Zealand and Australia. This includes discussion of the diverse cultural and performative traditions which influence this drama, and establishment of the critical methodologies to be used in the thesis. Chapter Two examines four plays which are intercultural re-writings of canonical texts from the European dramatic tradition. In this chapter I analyse the formal and thematic strategies in each of these plays in relation to the source texts, and ask to what extent they function as canonical counter-discourse by offering a critique of the assumptions of the earlier play from a post-colonial perspective. The potential of dramatic representation in forming perceptions of reality has made it an attractive forum for Maori and Aboriginal artists, who are creating theatre which has both a political and a pedagogical function. This discussion demonstrates that much of the impetus towards historiographic drama in both countries has come from Maori and Aboriginal writers and directors working in collaboration with white practitioners. Such collaborations not only advance the project of historiographic drama, but also may form the basis of future theatre practice which departs from the Western tradition and is unique to each of New Zealand and Australia. In Chapter Three I explore the interface between live and recorded performance by comparing plays and films which dramatise similar historical material. I consider the relative effectiveness of theatre and film as media for historiographic critique. I suggest that although film often has a greater cultural impact than theatre, to date live theatre has been a more accessible form of expression for Maori and Aboriginal writers and directors. Furthermore, following theorists such as Brecht and Brook, I argue that such aspects as the presence of the live performer and the design of the physical space shared by actors and audience give theatre considerable potential for creating an immediate engagement with historiographic themes. In Chapter Four, I discuss two contrasting examples of recorded drama in order to highlight the potential of film and television as media for historiographic critique. I question the divisions between the documentary and dramatic genres, and use Derrida&#65533;s notion of play to suggest that there is a constant slippage between the dramatic and the real, between the past and the present. In Chapter Five, I summarize the arguments advanced in previous chapters, using the example of the national museum of New Zealand, Te Papa Tongarewa, to illustrate that the &#65533;performance&#65533; of history has become part of popular culture. Like the interactive displays at Te Papa, the texts studied in this thesis demonstrate that dramatic representation has the potential to re-define perceptions of historical &#65533;reality&#65533;. With its superior capacity for creating illusion, film is a dynamic medium for exploring the imaginative process of history is that in the live performance the spectator symbolically comes into the presence of the past.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Historical drama</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">Aboriginal Australians</field><field name="subject">indigenous peoples</field><field name="subject">decolonization</field><field name="subject">literature</field><field name="subject">films</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070523.151011</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A discourse on the nature of Te Whanake [kit] : a series of textbooks and resources for adult learners of Maori : a commentary on the body of work submitted for the degree of Doctor of Literature at the University of Otago</field><field name="creator">Moorfield, John C</field><field name="description">As suggested in the regulations for the degree, this discourse on the nature of the Te Whanake series of Maori language textbooks and resources is being submitted with the series in support of the application for the award of the degree of Doctor of Literature (LittD) at the University of Otago.
	The purpose of this discourse is to make explicit some of the principles that underlie what is contained in the textbooks, the audio-and videotapes and the teachers&#65533; manuals. Some of this commentary repeats information provided in Maori or English in the teachers&#65533; manuals. As well as concentrating information about the nature of the Te Whanake series into one document, it is also for the benefit of those who do not understand Maori.
	This commentary will:
	outline the author&#65533;s background leading up to the writing of the Te Whanake series;
	discuss the content of the textbooks and resources;
	make explicit the teaching methodology underpinning the series and how these methods are implemented;
	explain the principles used in creating the textbooks and tape-recorded exercises; and discuss the pedagogic grammar of the Maori language contained in the textbooks.
	While the four student textbooks are central to the submission, the total set of resources needs to be considered. The description in Chapter Two will give an insight into what the four student textbooks, the teachers&#65533; manuals, the study guides and the audio-and videotaped exercises contain.
	While the textbooks, teachers&#65533; manuals, study guides and audiotapes of the Te Whanake series are original work by the author, the series does draw on the work of fluent speakers and writers of Maori, especially in the more advanced textbooks and supporting resources. This was necessary to expose the learners to a variety of contemporary texts as well as examples by writers from last century when Maori was still very much the language of Maori communities.
	It seems that by 1929 Maori was being offered as a unit for the Bachelor of Arts degree by the University of New Zealand, although there is conflicting information regarding the precise date when this started. However, it was not until 1951 that the language was actually taught by a permanent member of the faculty at any constituent college of the University of New Zealand when Professor Bruce Biggs was appointed Lecturer in Maori Studies at the University of Auckland.The other universities in New Zealand have gradually followed. The University of Waikato introduced Maori as a subject for a Bachelors degree early in its life in 1970 under the leadership of Timoti Karetu, but the University of Otago, which was established in 1869, only introduced Maori as a subject in 1981 despite having produced some outstanding Maori graduates such as Sir Peter Buck.
	It was only with the production of the Te Whanake textbooks and resources that a comprehensive series designed to teach Maori as a second language to adults has become available. Prior to the production of these resources the material available for teaching Maori language to adults was limited to a few grammar textbooks, the best of which was Bruce Biggs&#65533; Let&#65533;s Learn Maori. Other textbooks available were designed for teaching the language to children, the most notable of which are the more advanced textbook by Timoti Karetu called Te Reo Rangatira. There were no Maori language textbooks designed for developing the receptive and productive skills of adult learners of Maori. Some European languages such as English, French, Spanish and German have a variety of helpful and well designed textbooks and accompanying resources for adult foreign language learners. Maori had no such resources.
	The Te Whanake series provides the basis for a structured Maori language programme from beginner level through to the advanced learner of Maori. While further resources will continue to be added to the series, with the publication in 1996 of Te Whanake 4 Te Kohure and its set of six videotapes there is finally a comprehensive set of resources for teaching Maori to adults.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">language</field><field name="subject">reo Maori</field><field name="subject">study and teaching</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070523.152527</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Digging up data: a reanalysis of so called &#65533;horticultural&#65533; tools</field><field name="creator">Jones, Brenda M</field><field name="description">Elsdon Best&#65533;s 1925 work Maori Agriculture has been influential in New Zealand archaeology impacting on the terminology and assumed functions applied to so called &#65533;horticultural&#65533; implements retrieved in excavations, as well as those in museums and private collections. This thesis critically examines Best&#65533;s horticultural tool classification and the decisions he made with regards to tool function. Ethnographic accounts are investigated in an effort to understand how and why Best selected the terms and functions that he did. The literature review reveals anomalies in the conclusions that Best drew and the morphology of the tools that he described, highlighting the lack of order and confusion surrounding horticultural tool function, terminology and morphology, and prompting a much needed reassessment of horticultural implements.
	A study of artefacts from New Zealand museums was undertaken with the aim of generating two typologies for so called &#65533;horticultural&#65533; tools. The artefacts are classified to specific types using specified attributes, and following the classification process, are investigated for metric and non-metric variables that are indicative of the tool&#65533;s function. Graphical and basic statistical analyses revealed largely unimodal distributions for the metric attributes recorded for each tool type. Non-metric qualities also displayed a uniformity to their occurrence within the individual types.
	The data for each type is discussed with regards to tool function, combining the results of the attribute analyses with comparable tool morphologies from other Pacific cultures. The distribution of tool types in prehistoric New Zealand is also investigated in an effort to elucidate tool function.
	This investigation highlights the artefacts as earth-working implements, disestablishing the restricted horticultural context which for so long has been associated with such tools.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">prehistoric</field><field name="subject">agricultural implements</field><field name="subject">agriculture</field><field name="subject">gardening</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070523.153015</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A culturally safe public health research framework</field><field name="creator">Jeffs, Lynda Caron</field><field name="description">The concept of cultural safety arose in Aotearoa me Te Waipounamu/New Zealand in the late 1980&#65533;s in response to the differential health experience and negative health outcomes of the first nation people of Aotearoa me Te Waipounamu/New Zealand, the New Zealand Maori. It was introduced and developed by Maori nurses initially, as they recognised the effect culture had on health and understood safety as a common nursing concept. The concept of cultural safety has developed into a disipline which is taught as part of all nursing and midwifery curricula in Aotearoa me Te Waipounamu/New Zealand. As cultural safety has developed the concept of culture has been extended to include people who differ from the nurse by reason of: age, migrant status, sexual preference, socioeconomic status, religious persuasion, gender, ethnicity, and in Aotearoa me Te Waipounamu/New Zealand, the Treaty of Waitangi status of the nurse and recipient/s of her/his care.
	Nationally and internationally, health experience and health outcomes are poorer for people of minority group status than for people who are part of the dominant group. Public-health research is therefore generally conducted on, or with, people with minority group status. Public-health researchers, by education, are members of the dominant culture and may be unaware that their own and their clients; responses may relate to one/other or both cultures being diminished do not always ensure the safety of their own culture or the culture being researched.
	This study&#65533;s objective was to develop a flexible, culturally safe public health research framework for researches to use when researching people who are culturally different from themselves. The study will argue that the use of such a framework will contribute significantly to improved health outcomes for people with minority status and will assist the movement towards emancipatory social change.
	The methods undertaken included: gaining permission from Irihapeti Ramsden, the architect of cultural safety to undertake the research, conducting a literature review, consideration of primary sources and their key concepts, consulting widely with people in the field of public health and cultural safety, self reflecting on the writers own personal and professional experience and finally designing the culturally safe public health research framework.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">hauora</field><field name="subject">health</field><field name="subject">medical care</field><field name="subject">research</field><field name="subject">indigenous peoples</field><field name="subject">culture</field><field name="subject">tikanga</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070524.120343</field></doc><doc><field name="title">He kupu tuku iho mo tenei reanga : Te ahua o te tuku korero</field><field name="creator">Higgins, Rawinia R</field><field name="description">The primary objective of this thesis focuses on the nature of transmission of oral narratives, based on the relationship formed between the recipient and the source.

Material drawn from interviews with eight Ngai Tahu respondents are used to illustrate the factors influencing Ngai Tahu identity, which include whakapapa, land, language, tikanga, mahinga kai, the Claim, our legal identity, and the perceptions of significant others. These factors are discussed within the context of the wider Maori identity and the New Zealand environment.
	The interviews also provide an insight into the personal nature of Ngai Tahu cultural identity and the experiences of the respondents in terms of inclusion and exclusion from the general Maori identity.
	A theoretical base on the issues of cultural identity development is gained from the literature and used as a framework for discussing Ngai Tahu identity development. This research investigates the development of pan-Maori identity and how it has manifested itself within New Zealand society. The cultural criteria used to measure and assess membership in the Maori  ethnic collective are often inadequate and inappropriate for Ngai Tahu and within the Ngai Tahu context.
	This research illustrates how the environment and the choices it offers to people of Ngai Tahu identity both in the past and the present. I will argue that Ngai Tahu identity is largely a product of its circumstance. Although primordialist notions such as whakapapa are consistently present in that identity, the weight that they carry is largely determined by the political and cultural environment and context.

It commonly is employed to motivate and legitimate &#65533;identity politics&#65533; - a politics which is used to defend the rights of disadvantaged aboriginal minorities to maintain their traditional ways.
	Recently &#65533;identity politics&#65533; has been exploited in mainstream poltical/educational academic literature in New Zealand, especially in literature that deals with Maori issues. This is significant because in the recent history of New Zealand, liberal political theory has been dominant.
	Notions of rights and of fairness are fundamental to communitarianism and to liberalism, but communitarians and liberals hold very different ideas about what these notions involve. My PhD thesis compares their ideas and relates them to New Zealand. It views certain social and political issues in New Zealand, by way of liberal and then communitarian theories. It examines how liberalism and communitarianism have been, and can be, used to support and to legitimate particular policies and practices in terms of &#65533;fairness&#65533; and &#65533;justice&#65533;.
	My work considers the explanatory and the practical application of communitarianism and liberalism with respect to their conceptions of human nature, political ideals, rights and rationality. It defends liberalism against the communities the protections they &#65533;need&#65533; in order to flourish. With respect to New Zealand it recognises that Maori have been treated unjustly by the crown, but argues that much of the injustice happened, not because of liberalism, but because liberal values were not upheld.
	The thesis concludes that liberalism is better equipped than communitarianism to describe Maori and Pakeha relations, and to formulate a framework for positive and constructive trans-cultural policies that will respect both Maori and Pakeha cultures.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">civil rights</field><field name="subject">race relations</field><field name="subject">social policy</field><field name="subject">justice</field><field name="subject">fairness</field><field name="subject">communitarianism</field><field name="subject">liberalism</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070528.122329</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ko te kohika turuturu = (The enduring collection)</field><field name="creator">Williams, Jim</field><field name="description">Ko te kookoomuka te raakau i tunua ai te moa.

	This thesis proposes a model for research into traditional Maori kaupapa.
	Maori Studies is interdisciplinary in that it combines aspects of a considerable number of other disciplines and adds a further perspective of its own. However, despite the cross-overs with, for example, Anthropology, History, Linguistics, Art History, etc., Maori Studies provides its own unique, emic prespective which adds both depth and breadth to the study. Accordingly, research into kaupapa Maori requires a Maori model which draws from associated disciplines, forms interpretations according to the Maori world view and integrates all the various forms of evidence so that gaps in one area may be filled from another.
	Some steps towards resolution are proposed where the different forms of evidence seem to contradict, rather than complement each other. In particular the etic versus emic approach is examined with a view. Accordingly, the thesis will include an approach to the analysis and incorporation of traditional information available from: interviews; art; waiata; whakataukii; placenames; whakapapa; manuscripts and early census figures as well as the publised sources which are available. All must be compared with the contemporary oral record of past events, especially since much Maori tradition is political in nature, and the political perspective can change over time ("The Maori Camel"-paper presented to Pouhere Korero/NZHA Conference February 1996).
	(One of the particular strengths of Maori language material such as placenames, waiata, whakapapa, and whakatauki is that they have usually been repeated verbatim, often by people who hadn&#65533;t the language ability to change them. Therefore, like manuscripts they are frozen in time; unlike contemporary oral evidence where stories are retold in each generation.)
	The case studies look at the traditional Maori perspective on each of the topics and compares it with any research which has been done in Non-Maori ways. (For example, in Case Study 1., Maori knowledge which has been gathered by following the model proposed in this thesis is compared with botanical knowledge about cabbage trees.)
	Maori language material is not translated but handled in the original and discussed in Maori when a more productive discussion is thus facilitated, therefore resulting in a bi-lingual thesis. For Maori Studies to be fully accepted as having the same mana as other academic disciplines requires full acceptance of the bilingual nature of Maori Studies. However, in the iterests [sic] of wider accessibility, the majority of the discussion will be in English.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">kaupapa Maori</field><field name="subject">research methodology</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070528.123653</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Power relationships and community law centres in Dunedin : power relationships between community organisations, their communities and their funding bodies : specifically focusing on community law centres in Dunedin and the Legal Services Board</field><field name="creator">Walker, Peter E</field><field name="description">This research engages critically with major public sector accountability theories in relation to the development of law centres in Aotearoa/New Zealand (and comparative international examples) focusing on the two centres in Otago, the Ngai Tahu Maori Law Centre and the Dunedin Community Law Centre.
	Definitions of accountability are argued to be embedded within theoretical discourses which produce definable models of accountability corresponding to these theoretical statements. Case studies of the discourses of both law centres and their funding bodies are described and contrasted in terms of their views of the role of law centres, interaction with various interest groups and their accountability relationships. The data identifies a desire of both community law centres to engage with a communitarian, &#65533;bottom-up&#65533;, model of accountability, in contrast to the former social democratic-bureaucratic and current liberal &#65533;stakeholder&#65533; and &#65533;contract&#65533; models of the official funding agencies. The current dominance of the liberal &#65533;stakeholder&#65533; discourse is seen as based on professional power, hierarchical legal structure and control of funding. It is argued that any shift in the dominance of power relationships surrounding community law centres in Aotearoa/New Zealand would entail a strengthening of ties and links with the community, through seeking alternative power supports, a participatory structure and locally controlled funding.

The shift in these ideals, which have underpinned literacy instruction in the New Zealand primary school curriculum, is traced from the establishment of a &#65533;high-culture&#65533; British imperially-based notion of culture in the late 1920s to its replacement with a technocratic approach to literacy instruction in the revisions to primary school curriculum policy in the mid-1950s. This rise of a technocratic approach to literacy instruction resulted from what Frank Fischer has called a &#65533;quiet revolution&#65533;, where complex interactions between educational administrators, teacher unions, politicians, influential teachers, teacher educators, and politics in the administrative hierarchies and policies which governed the New Zealand primary school.
	This study provides an alternative vision of the history of the development of the New Zealand primary school curriculum. Previous New Zealand curriculum historians have portrayed the development of the primary school curriculum as a progressive evolution from the &#65533;old&#65533; methods of the early decades of mass education to the &#65533;modern&#65533; methods of the 1940s and 1950s. In contrast to the traditional view of the development of the New Zealand curriculum, this historical account of the development of literacy instruction in New Zealand focuses upon the political, cultural, and ideological processes that underpinned curriculum policy and practice during the period under investigation.
	By the mid-1950s, the overt ideals of English cultural imperialism had been exchanged for &#65533;scientific efficiency&#65533;. In this, &#65533;value-free&#65533; methods continued to embody dominant cultural beliefs under the supposedly neutral approaches of a technocratic approach to literacy. It is argued that the dominance of the cultural-heritage model of literacy instruction, with its elitist version of English language and culture, promoted a British-based &#65533;high-culture&#65533; tradition in the literacy curriculum. When the supposedly &#65533;value-neutral&#65533; methodologies were applied to literacy instruction in the early 1950s, these values survived as this technocratic approach to reading disengaged literacy instruction from the wider cultural, political, and social context.
	In recent years, the debates over reading techniques have once again surfaced in the public and academic press. These debates need to acknowledge this historical context and work towards a more balanced vision of literacy instruction, where literacy is not merely defined as the reading of the word. Current debates over reading techniques, curriculum policy, and literacy instruction practices need to view literacy as a complex process which is linked to a wider political and cultural world.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Education</field><field name="subject">matauranga</field><field name="subject">literacy</field><field name="subject">curriculum</field><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">reading</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070528.125057</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Resource Management Act 1991 and Nga Iwi Maori</field><field name="creator">Ruru, Tania Suzanne</field><field name="description">This thesis describes the sections in the Resource Management Act 1991 of particular relevance for nga Iwi Maori and assesses how well these facilitate involvement for Maori in the management of New Zealand&#65533;s resources. The method of assessment used is one of comparison between the schemes and philosophies of 1991 Act, and the active involvement of Maori in decision-making for their resources which is requires by Article ii of the Treaty of Waitangi (Te Tiriti o Waitangi).
	Part i describes the Maori world view of the environment and outlines the Treaty of Waitangi and its relevance to resource management law.
	Part ii describes the purpose and principles contained in sections 5, 6(e), 7(a), and 8 of the 1991 Act. Chapter Three provides an overview of the relationship between the purpose and principles. Chapter Four discusses the purpose in section 5 and proclaims that the inclusion of sustainability as a purpose in resource management legislation is advantageous in terms of the indirect furtherance of Maori conservation aspirations for the enviroment. It also describes how the cultural wellbeing of Maori has been interpreted to be an express part of the purpose of the Act. Chapter Five provides an analysis of section 6(e) which makes the relationship of Maori and their culture and traditions with their taonga a matter of national importance under the Act. Chapter Six describes section 7(a) and kaitiakitanga which must be given particular regard under the Act. Chapter Seven discusses section 8 and the content and meaning of the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi. Part ii concludes that while the facilitation of Maori involvement in the management and protection of natural and physical resources is improved under this Act, these sections are an insufficient safeguard for Maori interests.
	Part iii assesses the other sections in the Act which have a bearing on Maori involvement in resource management processes. Chapter Eight explores the planning system. Chapter Nine describes the resource consent processes in the 1991 Act. Chapter Ten comments on various procedural provisions which introduce tikanga Maori into the Act, and Chapter Eleven is devoted to exploring the sections in the Act which in the writer&#65533;s opinion provide the most potential for recognition of rangatiratanga in a limited form. This Part proclaims that the emphasis in the Act is very much on consultation with nga Iwi Maori as an effective means for their involement in resource management. It is submitted that this is not the active participation in decision-making that Maori seek and which is guaranteed under Article ii of the Treaty of Waitangi.
	Chapter Twelve acknowledges that involvement of nga Iwi Maori in processes under the 1991 Act will rely to some extent on the content of policy statements and plans produced by the local authorities. An analysis of the Proposed Otago Regional Policy Statement is undertaken to explore how the concerns of Kai Tahu have been incorporated into the statement.
	Chapter Thirteen ends by concluding that while the 1991 Act does provide for increased Maori involvement in resource management processes in New Zealand it does not facilitate the decision-making role guaranteed by Article ii of the Treaty of Waitangi.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">Treaty of Waitangi</field><field name="subject">Resource Management Act</field><field name="subject">environmental law</field><field name="subject">regional planning</field><field name="subject">citizen participation</field><field name="subject">conservation of natural resources</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070530.141814</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Can indigenous movements globalise?</field><field name="creator">McElwreath, Jennifer L</field><field name="description">The world&#65533;s indigenous peoples have been subjected to exploitation, discrimination, dispossession, relocation, assimilation and in some cases genocide since contact with the Western world. They have been the victims of an invasion which has since secured their position among the lowest social qualifiers. For centuries, they have been ignored by nation-states throughout the world. However, a new dawn has risen for the first peoples of the world, and for the past two decades thaey have experienced a cultural, political and social revival which has been gaining in popularity, intensity and effectiveness since it&#65533;s inception.
	The politicisation of indigenous movements and their fundamentally local characteristics has occurred at the same time that the world is experiencing a sense of accelerated globalisation. Economic integration through trade agreements has diminished boundaries and has allowed multinational corporations to travel, sell and trade at will. The sense that the world is &#65533;one place&#65533; has fast become a reality through "the increasing volume and rapidity of the flows of money, goods, people, information, technology and images." (Featherstone, 1995:81)
	The simultaneous globalisation and localisation of the world seems to be two contradictory phenomenon acting in opposition to one another. However, as several theorists have pointed out, the two are actually related and each to some degree attributes to the existence of the other (Eriksen, 1993:9; Featherstone, 1990:10; Friedman, 1990:327). In fact, indigenous movements themselves, while asserting local issues and rights, have undergone a recent transformation and now attempt to achieve their goals through global strategies. They have expanded their methods and now not only at the community and national levels, but also within the international arena.
	The Maori and the Native Hawaiians are two groups of indigenous peoples who have been fighting for their rights and land for over a century. Both groups represent small percentages of their nation-states&#65533; population. This has forced them to pursue their struggle with creative strategies and persistent, patient pressure. Thus, their struggles have undergone continouos transformations in attempts to discover the most effective formula which would eventually cause their respective nation-states to recognise and address their grievances.
	Recently, the Maori and the Native Hawaiians, have broadened their movement to incorporate an international tier. Activity on the international level includes international conferences, international visits/exchanges, ratification of indigenous declarations, indigenous networking, and international indigenous solidarity organisations. These activities have increased over the past twenty years as the effectiveness of such activity has also increased. New Zealand, the United States and other nation-states are being held more accountable for past injustices and are being driven to answer to the world&#65533;s indigenous community.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">indigenous peoples</field><field name="subject">Hawaii</field><field name="subject">human rights</field><field name="subject">international relations</field><field name="subject">self-determination</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070530.144243</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Maori Whare after contact</field><field name="creator">Martin, David Robert</field><field name="description">This study explores post-contact changes to the ordinary Maori whare. The main physical characteristics of the ordinary whare at contact are identified by accessing archaeological and written 18th century ethnographic data. Changes in the ordinary whare in the period from contact to 1940 are discussed. Evidence from historical archaeology, written 19th century ethnographic accounts and from previous academic research is considered. In addition, changes in the ordinary whare are highlighted, based on evidence from an empirical survey of whare depicted in sketches, paintings, engravings and photographs. Rigorous statistical analysis was beyound the scope of a Master&#65533;s thesis, however trends in the data are presented. A range of these are reproduced illustrating the text. After changing gradually for 130 years, the ordinary Maori whare appears to have been widely replaced by European-style houses in the early decades of the 20th century.
	In Aotearoa/New Zealand in the 1990s, it is apparent that Maori culture has survived the 220 or so years since contact. These years entailed increasing contact between Maori and European. In mid 20th century academic studies of Maori communities, European-style houses were found to have been used in line with continuing Maori conceptions. This evidence indicates that traditional ideas were transferred to European-style houses. The gradual changes in the whare prior to the 20th century indicate that it was a conservative social construction of space conforming to expectations about vernacular architecture generally. But the process by which Maori culture was maintained and reproduced was complicated that further study of Maori conceptions of space within the home is required.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">dwellings</field><field name="subject">architecture</field><field name="subject">housing</field><field name="subject">history</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070530.145017</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Kindling tikanga environmentalism : the common ground of native culture and democratic citizenship</field><field name="creator">Hirsch, Robb Young</field><field name="description">An innovative regime combining native culture and democracy in community fisheries management has crystallized in New Zealand. While researchers have looked into co-management of natural resources between communities and governments, and various studies have isolated indigenous ecologies on one hand and highlighted environmentalism in modern society on another society on another, no substantial research has gauged the opportunities for indigenous peoples and the wider citizenry of democratic-capitalistic societies to collaborate as cultures in concert with the environmental law. The primary research, involving local experimentation, concerns the viability of the novel cooperative endeavor called Taiapure-local fishery. I discovered in the principal trial communities in the North and South Islands that its design is compelling if properly understood. Yet the salience of the regime is hampered by external pressures from the commercial fishing industry, control by central government, and by internal lack of solidarity and trust.

This research takes a specific landscape, the South Island high country, and identifies and evaluates how it is perceived. It is evident that the way in which individuals perceive landscape reflects not only their physical enviroment, but their culture. Culture gains even greater importance in this process, when one considers the perceptions of community and society.
	Landscape perception concerns how individuals view and interact with their environment. It is the initial step in developing opinions and positions on issues relating to a specfic area. Experience of, and participation are identified as crucial components of the perception process. Those who indicated they were actively involved in the high country were more likely to have richer and more acute perceptions of the area than those who were not so involved. The latter group tended to reflect the imagery of the media and other sources.
	Current perceptions of the high country were found to be oriented around images of pastoral farming, wilderness experience, recreation and tourism activity. The location of the high country, as perceived by respondents, centred on the lakes district of inland Otago and South Canterbury. Where survey respondents resided was clearly of influence on their perceived high country.
	While the perceived high country reflected much of the historical imagery, it also reflected socioeconomic change in the area. The move from pastoralism to recreation and tourism was apparent, as was resistance by the public to alienation of high country land through sale of Crown land to overseas interests and its use in Treaty settlements. There was general acceptance, especially amongst experts, that change in the area (lease reorganisation and economic activity in particular) will have an important impact on landuse and how the public perceives the high country.
	The future of the high country is seen by lay-person and expert alike as lying with the expansion of tourism and recreation. This will see more people visiting and living in the area. All interviewees agreed that pastoral farming will play a decreasing role in the area and that a greater diversity of landuse and, in turn, perceptions of the high country will result from these shifts.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">South Island</field><field name="subject">geographical perception</field><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">landscape assessment</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070530.151028</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Making cultural heritage policy in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Smith, Amanda Jane</field><field name="description">This thesis examines how cultural heritage policies are developed in New Zealand. Cultural heritage symbolises the development of a society, illustrating past events and changing customs and values. Because of its significance, the government has accepted responsibility for protecting cultural heritage, and has developed a number of institutions and a variety of policies to address this responsibility. It is important to understand how the goverment uses these mechanisms to protect cultural heritage, and the subsequent relationships that have developed between actors in the cultural heritage area. These will have an impact on the effectiveness of the policy which is developed.
	Cultural heritage is treasured by society for a number of reasons, but as social attitudes change, so does the treatment of cultural heritage. It is re-defined, re-interpreted and used to promote a sense of pride in the commmunity. This manipulation extends to policy making. Since the 1980s, the government has influenced, and been influenced by, two major social changes. There has been an introduction of free market principles such as rationalisation, competition and fiscal responsibility into the New Zealand economy and political structure. These principles have been applied to cultural heritage and consequently cultural heritage is treated as a commodity. As the result of changing attitudes towards the treatment of the Maori and Maori resources, there has been a movement towards implementing biculturalism. This has meant a re-evaluation of how Maori taonga is treated, particularly of the ways Maori cultural heritage has been used to promote a sense of New Zealandness.
	There are several major actors involved in cultural heritage policy making - government, policy units, cultural heritage organisations and local authorities. Central government is the dominant force in the political process, with control over the distribution of resources and the responsibilities assigned to other actors. Because the use of market principles and movement towards biculturalism have been embraced at the central government level, other actors in the policy making process are also expected to adopt them. Policy units develop options to fit with the government&#65533;s general economic and political agenda. The structures adopted for the public service are designed to encompass market principles, particularly the efficient use of resources and competitiveness. While cultural heritage organisations may influence the government&#65533;s agenda through lobbying and information-sharing, they are limited by issues such as funding and statutory requirements. Government has shifted many responsibilities to the regions, but while territorial authorities are influenced by the concerns of their communities, they are also subject to directions from the government.
	The process and structures which have been outlined do not contribute to an effective policy making system. The use of market principles to direct cultural heritage protection tends to encourage uneven and inconsistent policies, both at national and local levels. The range of cultural heritage definitions used by government agencies also promotes inconsistency. Cultural heritage is encompassed in a large number of government departments and ministries, which makes the co-ordination funding by meeting required &#65533;outputs&#65533; and the government&#65533;s requirement of fiscal responsibility. This is not appropriate language for cultural heritage, which should not have to be rationalised as an economic good. Although the government has devolved a number of responsibilities and territorial authorities have a variety of mechanisms available to protect cultural heritage, there is no nation-wide criteria for territorial involvement. Because of regional differences there is an uneven treatment of cultural heritage. Those policies developed by territorial authorities will also be influenced by the government&#65533;s economic direction. Organisations supported by the Dunedin City Council, for example, must also provide budgets and strategic plans which fit with Council&#65533;s fiscal objectives.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">cultural property</field><field name="subject">heritage</field><field name="subject">art and state</field><field name="subject">archaeology</field><field name="subject">cultural policy</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070530.152110</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A social history of archaeology in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Hood, David James</field><field name="description">Consideration of the degree to which social factors have influenced the development of archaeology has become a recent focus of interest among archaeologists; however little work has been done on determining the relationship of social factors to archaeology in new Zealand. The aim of this thesis is to consider whether archaeologists were influenced by the surrounding New Zealand society between the years 1840 and 1954 and if so, in what manner were they influenced. In particular, consideration is given to how the social background of New Zealand archaeology compared with the social influences of British archaeology compared with the social influence of British archaeology of the time.
	For the purposes of the study the term archaeologist applies to all those who investigated or recovered in situ archaeological material. Lists of archaeologists of the day were compiled from journals, newspaper articles, and unpublished sources. From these lists the social background of those engaging in archaeology was reconstructed.
	Developments in archaeology theory and methodology were also examined, not only to determine the manner in which they effected the practise of archaeology, but also to determine the source of those developments, and the reasons for their adoption.
	The wider social context was also examined to determine the degree to which archaeology reflected certain factors in New Zealand society, not simply in the manner in which archaeology was carried out, but also in the reasons for which research was conducted.
	This study demonstrates that though the discipline, and in particular the power, was concentrated among urban professionals, the social spread of those engaging in archaeology was wide. This was particularly the case between the turn of the century and the Second World War, when archaeologists with a tertiary background were in a minority.
	Archaeologists were influenced both from inside and outside the field, the degree of influence being determined by individual factors.
	As archaeologists were a part of society, so too was society part of archaeological practice. In the manner in which archaeology was conducted the influence of societal attitudes towards women and Maori can be seen.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Archaeology</field><field name="subject">history</field><field name="subject">prehistoric peoples</field><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">antiquities</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070530.152806</field></doc><doc><field name="title">&#65533;Where land meets water&#65533; : rights to the foreshore of Otakou Maori Reserve</field><field name="creator">Hanham, Susan Janette</field><field name="description">Rights to possess and/or use the foreshore of New Zealand are not clear, and are even cloudier in relation to Maori freehold land that is on the coast. This thesis investigates the law pertaining to rights in the foreshore, and the facts pertaining specifically to the use of the Otakou Maori Reserve foreshore. In particular, the research question is this: what does aboriginal title mean in 1996 for Otago Maori? Examining the legal issues, searching individual titles and gathering oral history are the methods used to answer this question.
	First, the law. In New Zealand the Crown is prima facie the absolute owner of the foreshore. This can be displaced by proof to the contrary. The doctrine of aboriginal title recognises the legal continuity of tribal property rights upon the Crown&#65533;s acquisition of sovereignty over their territory. Aboriginal title can be divided into two categories - territorial and non-territorial. Territorial title represents a tribal claim to full ownership, and non-territorial title to rights that are less than absolute ownership, such as the right to cross land, to fish and to collect flora and fauna. It is this doctrine of aboriginal title as it relates to the foreshore that can displace the Crown&#65533;s absolute ownership of the foreshore.
	Second, the facts. 99% of the coastal land parcels of Otakou Maori Reserve are described in written documentation as to the line of mean high water. This 99% is made up 17% Maori freehold land, 49% general land and 33% vested in the Crown or the Dunedin City Council. The remaining 1% is Maori freehold land that does not have its boundary at mean high water, but has a fixed upland boundary. Oral history facts from the takatawhenua identify that the foreshore continues to be used for access, travel, and the collection of kai moana and sea resources.
	The findings reveal that Kai Tahu ki Otakou have never extinguised their territorial and non-territorial aboriginal title to the foreshore of Otakou Maori Reserve. Suggested areas for future research include an investigation of other Maori reserves in Otago, and examining the doctrine of aboriginal title as it relates to the beds of watercourses.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">Kai Tahu</field><field name="subject">land tenure</field><field name="subject">land title</field><field name="subject">coastal zone management</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070530.153901</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The visual representation of the Maori in the School Journal 1907-95</field><field name="creator">Dickson, Joanna</field><field name="description">This thesis concerns the visual representation of the Maori in illustrations featured in the School Journal, Bulletins, Maori Language Readers, and Remedial Readers published by the New Zealand Department of Education from 1907-96.

For this reason School Journals were chosen as they have been a resource available to all school children for almost a century, and reflect changing theories incorporated into illustrations which can be just as significant, or even more powerful, than text in transmitting information (and sometimes culture-bound values) to the public about past Maori lifeways.

All presently identify as Maori and have arrived at this point following a diverse range of experiences. The thesis documents these experiences and those things that are important to them on a personal level. As such, this thesis investigates the topic of Maori ethnicity as it pertains to a group of individuals, not to Maoridom as a whole.
	It was found that no single paradigm could be applied to my informant&#65533;s conception of identity. Each constructed their identity in a unique way. Integral to all identities, however, was the use of both cultural and biological factors. In constructing and maintaining their identities as Maori my informants looked firstly to the presence of ancestry and, following from this cultural practices were employed. The use of ancestry as a basis of identity, and the causal attributes associated with it (such as natural leanings towards the use of Maori language), represent essentialist tendencies on the part of many of my informants. Also of great interest was the perception, by many of my informants, that cultural traits were innate.

	This study set out to provide a more detailed skeletal description and to investigate the question of population homogeneity by examinig kuri skeletal material from five museums and two university anthropology departments. Metric and non-metric data was collected from a total of thirty seven archaeological sites from throuhout New Zealand.
	Variation within the population was established by comparing coefficients of variation across a number of variables. A program of univariate and multivariate analysis was carried out to examine spatial and temporal variation.
	Results showed that the appendicular skeleton of the kuri has the highest levels of variation. Smaller limb shaft dimensions of late prehistoric kuri are thought to be due to a reliance on insufficient quantities of marine foods.

The present study shows that Maori people are concerned that the power and control over research issues of initiation, benefits, representation, legitimation and accountability are addressed by the imposition of the researcher&#65533;s agenda, concerns and interests on the research process. Such dominance of a Western orientated discourse is being challenged by a pro-active, Kaupapa Maori research approach. This approach is part of the revitalisation of Maori cultural aspirations, preferences and practices as a philosophical and productive educational stance and resistance to the hegemony of the dominant discourse in Aotearoa/New Zealand.
	Kaupapa Maori research is collectivistic, and is orientated toward benefiting all the research participants and their collectively determined agendas. Kaupapa Maori Research is based on growing concensus that research involving Maori knowledge and people needs to be conducted in culturally appropriate ways, ways that fit Maori cultural preferences, practices and aspirations in order to develop and acknowledge existing culturally appropriate approaches in the method, practice and organisation of research. This thesis examines how a group of researchers have addressed the importance of devolving power and control in the research exercise in order to promote self-determination (tino Rangatiratanga) of Maori people. In the thesis I have talked with researchers who have accepted the challenge of positioning themselves within the discursive practice that is Kaupapa Maori. As a result, this thesis examines how such positionings challenge what constitutes a process of theory generation within the context of Aotearoa/New Zealand.
	This thesis further seeks to examine a way of knowing that reflects what meanings I can construct from my positioning within an experiential Kaupapa Maori research matrix. My position within this matrix resulted from critical reflections on my participation in a research group with an agreed-to agenda, my participation within the projects considered in the narratives in this thesis, my talking with other research participants in the form termed "interviews as chat" and from our constructing joint narratives about their/our attempts to address Maori concerns about research in their practice.
	The broad methodological framework used in the thesis is narrative inquiry for such an approach allows the research participants to select, recollect and reflect on stories within their own cultural context and language rather than in that chosen by the researcher. In other words, the story teller maintains the power to define what constitutes the story and the truth and the meaning it has for them. Further, this thesis seeks to investigate my own position as a researcher within a co-joint reflection on shared experiences and co-joint construction of meanings about these experiences, a position where the stories of the other research participants merged with my own to create new stories. Such collaborative stories go beyond an approach that simply focusses on the cooperative sharing of experiences and focusses on connectedness, engagement, and involvement with the other research participants within the cultural world view/discursive practice within which they function. This thesis seeks to identify what constitutes this engagement and what implications this has for promoting self determination/agency/voice in the research participants by examining concepts of participatory consciousness and connectedness within Maori discursive practice.
	Whakawhanaungatanga (establishing relationships in a Maori context), is used metaphorically to give voice to a culturally positioned means of collaboratively constructing research stories in a &#65533;culturally conscious and connected manner&#65533;. The thesis explains that there are three major overlapping implications of whakawhanaungatanga as a research strategy. The first is that establishing and maintaining relationships is a fundamental, often extensive and ongoing part of the research process. This involves the establishment of &#65533;whanau of interest&#65533; through a process of &#65533;spiral dicourse&#65533;. The second is that researchers understand themselves to be involved somatically in the research process; that is physically, ethically, morally and spiritually and not just as a &#65533;researcher&#65533; concerned with methodology. Such positionings are demonstrated in the language/metaphor used by the researchers in the stories described in this thesis. The third is that establishing relationships in a Maori context addresses the power and control issues fundamental to research, because it involves participatory research practices, in this context, termed &#65533;Participant Driven research&#65533;.</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">research</field><field name="subject">kaupapa Maori</field><field name="subject">kura kaupapa Maori</field><field name="subject">biculturalism</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070531.124559</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Iwi management plans and consultation under the Resource Management Act 1991</field><field name="creator">Anich, Vanessa F</field><field name="description">The Resource Management Act (hereafter &#65533;the RM Act&#65533;) has significantly changed the statutory framework for natural resource management in New Zealand.

It consolidates into one statute most of the laws that regulate the use of New Zealand&#65533;s natural and physical resources.

	The RM Act contains provisions designed to, amongst other things, safeguard Maori heritage interests, make consultation between consent agencies and tangata whenua mandatory in the preparation of local authority plans and policy statements, provide for the delegation of authority to iwi, and to instruct decision makers to take the principles of the Treaty into account when exercising functions and duties under the act. These provisions provide new opportunities for a distinctive Maori dimension to be incorporated into resource management decision making practice.
	The ability is present within the RM Act to remove some of the barriers that have prevented Maori from participating in decisions on the management of resources. The interest of tangata whenua in natural resource management are now a part of the statutory framework. This has the effect of increasing the interaction, consultation and accountability of iwi and local government when natural resources are managed.
	The realization of the potential of these iwi provisions in the RM Act will require decision makers and local iwi to develop a working relationship by exploring models of consultation and co-management. For the relationship to be effective, it will need to be based on mutual tolerance and cooperation. The rights and duties in the relationship are complementary and rest with both parties. Long-term sucess will require a commitment from both local authorities and tangata whenua to work together in good faith and with clarity of purpose to develop kaupapa (plan, strategy) for the present and future management of natural resources.</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">resource management</field><field name="subject">land use</field><field name="subject">citizen participation</field><field name="subject">natural resources</field><field name="subject">regional planning</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070531.125119</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Nursing a colonial hangover : towards bicultural planning in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Henderson, Andrew</field><field name="description">Planning, specifically resource management, is an activity of the state which should seek to reflect the values of the people. However, in New Zealand, only the values of the dominant Pakeha culture have traditionally been considered by decision makers. As a result, resource management in New Zealand has developed as a monocultural institution. This thesis addresses the issue of monoculturalism in New Zealand&#65533;s planning regime. The aims of this thesis are twofold:
	(1) to examine the argument that New Zealand&#65533;s planning is monocultural, and has traditionally ignored the needs and aspirations of Maori; and
	(2) to examine the current resource management system in New Zealand in order to establish the basis for a bicultural approach to planning.
	These aims were addressed in two principal ways. First, a critical review of literature provided comprehensive background on the relationship between Western and non-Western cultures. Second, in depth interviews were held with both Maori and non-Maori involved in resource management structures. Data from these interviews illustrate Maori opinion on the current resource management system in New Zealand.
	The thesis concludes that biculturalism is the only legitimate structure for state policy in New Zealand. This conclusion is based primarily on the relationship established between the indigenous Maori and the Pakeha settlers through the Treaty of Waitangi.
	This study also found that the current resource management regime in New Zealand is incapable of supporting a bicultural resource management approach. Radical reforms are needed in order to facilitate bicultural planning. The thesis concludes by proposing changes to the current regime which will facilitate a bicultural approach to New Zealand planning.</field><field name="date">1994</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">natural resources</field><field name="subject">regional planning</field><field name="subject">land use</field><field name="subject">Treaty of Waitangi</field><field name="subject">biculturalism</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070531.125653</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Institutions, cooperation, and the quota management system</field><field name="creator">Boas, Andrew</field><field name="description">The purpose of this thesis is to analyse the evolution of New Zealand&#65533;s Quota Management System (QMS) for marine fisheries. Analysis is performed using institutional theory and methodology.
	A broad review of institutional theory is made. In contrast to neoclassical economic theory, of which institutionalists have been a major voice of dissent, institutionalism stresses a holistic approach to policy analysis. An understanding of the the forces for institutional change and the structure of that change are the primary focus of institutionalism.
	An institutional framework for understanding the common pool nature of fishery resources is adopted. This highlights how the physical and technical characteristics of the resource and related decision-making arrangements influence the patterns of human interaction that determine the outcomes of a management regime such as the QMS.
	It is shown that the QMS was adopted in 1986 to address the biological crisis that had occurred because of past open access management policies. The fiscal crisis and the economic ideology prevailing at the time were also influential in promoting the QMS. The system was not able to be expanded as was intended because of a series of challenges from Maori disputing the Crown&#65533;s right to fishery resources. The Deed of Settlement signed in 1992, has supposedly settled Maori claims to commercial fisheries and allowed expansion of the QMS.
	Assessing the QMS using the institutional framework developed, showed the strong influence that neoclassical ideology has played in determining the outcomes achieved. Inadequate information concerning biophysical, social and economic implications of fishing constrain the ability of the QMS to successfully manage the resource. Inconsistencies and inadequacies in the legislation are only just being addressed as part of a comprehensive legislative review process.
	The future development of the QMS is also addressed in terms of the likelihood of cooperative common property management regimes being adopted. The common pool nature of the fisheries makes common property management regimes preferable. Cooperative community cultures are claimed by institutionalists to improve the outcomes achieved in common property regimes. There was considered, however, to be only limited potential for cooperation within the current institutional structure for New Zealand&#65533;s fisheries. Although the changes of the legislative review appear to be making some progressive changes, the diversity of interest groups and the prevailing western culture are seen as potential impediments to a comprehensive cooperative regime.</field><field name="date">1994</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">fisheries</field><field name="subject">quota system</field><field name="subject">resource management</field><field name="subject">institutional economics</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070531.130233</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Culture change in northern Te Wai Pounamu</field><field name="creator">Barber, Ian G</field><field name="description">In the northern South Island, the area northern Te Wai Pounamu (NTWP) is defined appropriate to a regional investigation of pre-European culture change. It is argued that the Maori sequence of this region is relevant to a range of interpretative problems in New Zealand&#65533;s archaeological past.
	Preparatory to this investigation, the international and New Zealand literature on culture change is reviewed. Two primary investigative foci of change are identified in NTWP; subsistence economy and stone tool manufacturing technology. A chronological scheme of Early, Middle and Late Periods based on firmly dated ecological events and/or independent radiocarbon ages is defined so as to order the archaeological data without recourse to unproven scenarios of cultural change and association.
	The Early Period subsistence economy is assessed in some detail. An Early Period settlement focus is documented along the eastern Tasman Bay coast in proximity to meta-argillite sources. Early Period midden remains suggest that several genera of seal and moa were exploited, and that people were fishing in eastern Tasman Bay during the warmer months of the year. From the Early Period fishhook assemblages of Tasman Bay, manufacturing change is inferred related to the increasing scarcity of moa bone over time. It is argued that lower Early Period settlement of the larger northern South Island was focused on the north-eastern coast to Rangitoto (D&#65533;Urville Island), while NTWP was characterized by smaller stone working communities operating in summer.
	In contrast, moa-free middens in Awaroa Inlet and Bark Bay of the western Tasman Bay granite coast present a physical dominance of Paphies australis, and finfish species suggesting, along with the dearth of Austrovenus stutchburyi, occupation outside of the warmer summer months. These middens also present an absence of seal and a paucity of bird bone, while sharing a robust 15th-16th centuries AD radiocarbon chronology. With the dearth of all bird species from granite coast middens in general, and evidence that the less preferred kokako (Callaeas c. cinerea) was caught during the occupation of Awaroa Inlet N26/214, it is suggested that cultural regulations beyond immediate subsistence needs were also operating at this time.
	From southern Tasman Bay, the archaeological investigation of the important Appleby site N27/118 suggests that the people associated with the extensive horticultural soils of Waimea West otherwise consumed finfish and estuarine shellfish in (non-summer) season, kiore (Rattus exulans), dog or kuri (Canis familiaris), and several small evidence of Maori tradition, archaeological charcoal, and the approximately 16th century radiocarbon chronology for N27/118 and the associated Appleby gravel borrow pit N27/122 places the advent of extensive Waimea horticulture within the post-moa, lower Middle Period Maori economy. The Haulashore Island archaeological assemblage of south-eastern Tasman Bay with a similar material culture to Appleby is also bereft of seal and any diagnostic moa bone.
	This Middle Period evidence is considered in a larger comparative perspective, where the absence of seal from 15th-16th centuries Tasman Bay middens is interpreted as a factor of human predation. A secure radiocarbon chronology suggests the convergence of this loss with the diminishment and loss of selected avifauna, and the subsequent advent of large horticultural complexes in the northern South Island compensated for the loss of faunal calories in a seasonally economy and a managed ecology.
	The evidence of stone tool use is also reviewed in some detail for NTWP, following the definition of an adze typology appropriate to the classification of meta-argillite tools. It is clear that meta-argillite is the dominant material of adze and (non-adze) flake tool manufacture throughout the Maori sequence of NTWP, while granite coast quartz remains generally subdominant. Beyound the apparent loss of the laterally-hafted adze, the evidence of adze change is generally subdominant. Beyond the apparent loss of the laterally-hafted adze, the evidence of adze change is generally reflected in shifting typological proportions, and in new manufacturing technologies and dressing techniques. Functional change may be inferred in the loss over time of large meta-argillite points and blade tools associated respectively with the manufacture of one-piece moa bone fishhooks and moa and seal butchery. The exclusive identification of hammer-dressed adzes with hump backs and steep bevels in Middle Period assemblages is related to the advent of horticultural intensification. More generally, adzes of the upper Early and Middle Periods are increasingly characterized by round sections, while hammer-dressing is employed more frequently and extensively reduced from riverine meta-argillite and recycled banks. Collectively, these changes reflect a developing emphasis on economy and opportunistic exploitation. From this interpretation, and evidence that meta-argillite adze length and the size of high quality Ohana source flakes diminish over time, it is suggested that accessible, high quality and appropriately shaped meta-argillite rock became increasingly scarce through intensive quarry manufacture.
	In conclusion, the coincidence of diminishing rock and faunal resources over time is related in a speculative anthropological model of culture change. It is proposed that the 14th-16th centuries Maori economy of NTWP, and by implication and inference, many other regions of New Zealand, was characterized by a resource crisis which either precipitated or reinforced a broader trajectory of culture change. It is suggested that influential leadears perceived a linkage in the loss of high quality rock and important subsistence fauna at this time, and that distinctive technologies, institutions and ideologies of Middle Period Maori society were influenced by, and/or developed from, this perception. Finally, it is recommended that the data of an archaeological Maori culture sequence be ordered and tested within a radiocarbon based chronological scheme, rather than the still generally used model of &#65533;Archaic&#65533; and &#65533;Classic&#65533; cultural periods. It is also suggested that New Zealand archaeologists should look beyond the functional-ecological imperative to consider more holistic anthropological explanations of change in the pre-European Maori past, with a focus on integrated regional sequences.</field><field name="date">1994</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">Nelson</field><field name="subject">Marlborough</field><field name="subject">Te Waipounamu</field><field name="subject">archaeology</field><field name="subject">history</field><field name="subject">social change</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070531.135029</field></doc><doc><field name="title">&#65533;This must be the place&#65533; : plumbing a land ethic for the built environment</field><field name="creator">Ballantyne, Brian Andrew</field><field name="description">A land ethic within the built enviroment was examined from the perspective of the surveying community in New Zealand. The research followed a structure of context, interpretation and application; used legal analysis; and, sampled the ideologies of iwi liason officers, consultant surveyors, and local authorities.
	Context involved asking why a land ethic was being debated, by focusing on the current level of environmental thought, and on the actions of the International Federation of Surveyors (FIG) and the New Zealand Institute of Surveyors (NZIS). Some findings are: that terms such as sustainable management and nature are ambiguous cultural constructs; and, that the adoptation of an environmental policy by the NZIS continues to be a tortuous process.
	Interpretation involved asking what constituted a New Zealand ethic, by putting such an ethic into perspective in relation to ecophilosophy, and by searching for a contemporary sense of kaitiakitanga. Some findings are: that restraint and humility are requirements in any moral theory of nature; that kaitiakitanga is not dependent on title to land; and, that iwi liason officers are divided as to how kaitiakitanga applied to the built environment.
	Application involved suggesting how a land ethic could be invoked in the built environment, through the provision of green space in the form of local purpose reserves. Some findings are: that surveyors regard reserves as being significantly less vital to a community&#65533;s well-being than engineered services; and, that local authorities are not generally aware that reserve policies might have to be linked to municipal open space strategies.
	The broad conclusions are: that regardless of the environment that now exists, surveyors will be required to make moral choices about the environment that is sought; that a land ethic will not necessarily provide rational prescriptions directing action towards land; and, that there is inherent tension between land tenure, land use and a land ethic. Suggested avenues for further research include a comparative analysis of other landed professions; the empowerment of women within any land ethic; and, the use of content analysis as an alternative methodology.</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">environmental protection</field><field name="subject">surveying</field><field name="subject">sustainable development</field><field name="subject">ecology</field><field name="subject">cosmology</field><field name="subject">planning</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070531.140040</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ka pu te ruha, ka hao te rangatahi</field><field name="creator">Hakopa, Henry Hauiti</field><field name="description">The relationship between Maori and land is imperative. It forms the basis for developing conceptual blueprints fundamental to producing a data model from a Maori paradigm and integrating that cultural paradigm with western information systems technology.
	The primary objective of this thesis focuses on blending ancient Maori techniques for managing land information with the advanced tools offered by information systems technology. Like other oral traditions, information about ancestral land and resources were registered in the memories of tribal elders and leaders. Today Maori land information found in the Maori land courts are largely paper-based. By contrast, western civilisations have adapted quickly to computerised systems for managing land information. Unfortunately for Maori, most GIS tend to operate on models influenced by the viewpoint of the dominating culture and their world view. This poses challenges and risks for Maori.
	This research rejects the idea of adopting technology wholesale, based on western paradigms. Argued from an eclectic theoretical approach incorpating a Maori world view, this study captures the cultural concept of land, develops a conceptual blueprint based on that perspective, and engages that cultural stamp into a western system of managing land information.
	Thus a blend of the old and the new techniques for managing Maori land information is incorporated, hence ka pu te ruha, ka hao te rangatahi.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Geographic information systems</field><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">land tenure</field><field name="subject">land titles</field><field name="subject">information storage and retrieval systems</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070524.125029</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The service quality of Maori tourism operators : a gap analysis</field><field name="creator">Renata, Steven M</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the nature and elements of Maori involvement in tourism using a dyadic assessment of operator service quality.
	The SERVQUAL instrument has been proposed as an instrument for the measurement of perceived service quality within a wide range of service categories. The current research examines both the operation of the scale and its management implications in four major sectors of the New Zealand tourism industry.
	Data for this study was collected through random mall intercept using a judgemental nonprobability sample of leading Maori tourism operators. In total, two hundred and thirteen useable responses formed the basis of the results.
	Major outcomes of the study reveal that; the conceptualisation and measurement of Maori cultural impacts on service encounters is problematic due the difficulty in defining who and what is Maori; the definition and measurement of service quality as a five dimensional construct as in SERVQUAL appears to suffer from a number of methodological shortcomings. For researchers in the process of using SERVQUAL, the results of this study suggest to exercise caution. Suggestions are provided with implications for instrument modification.
	The final outcome of the study reveals that the service quality of Maori tourism operators contains significant service gaps highlighting potential strengths and weakness and profiles of sector specific characteristics for the future development of this tourism field.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">tourism</field><field name="subject">service quality</field><field name="subject">surveys</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070530.143739</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The morphology of the pre-European Maori femur and its functional significance</field><field name="creator">Hay, Alistair</field><field name="description">The life of the pre-European Maori consisted of subsistence strategies ranging from hunter-gatherer to horticultural activities. The femur of both sexes is generally characterised by a flattened proximal shaft rotated inward, and by a short, markedly bowed, robust diaphysis. Femoral rugosity denotes the attachment of relatively great thigh musculature which, in turn, is an indicator of the levels of physical activity associated with the subsistence strategies undertaken. The femoral neck and head is distinguished from contemporary populations and those of comparative subsistence strategies by a larger anterior offset (anteversion) and greater horizontal inclination (Coxa valga). In addition to consistently large femoral anteversion, the femoral head is denoted by a broad, horizontally oval insertion for the ligament of the head (fovea). These external morphological traits are such consistent features within the femur they represent racial attributes of the pre-European Maori population. The femoral morphology of the pre-European Maori has been described by earlier researchers dating back 109 years to 1886. However, there have been limited functional evaluations of the external traits, in particular, how traits are associated with respect to each other. To resolve these limitations and determine a biological basis to femoral morphology a comprehensive analysis of external traits from the femur and pelvis is combined with the biomechanical properties of geometric profiles at six cross-sectional levels of the diaphysis.
	From six major regions within New Zealand a total of 107 pooled femora in three catalogued &#65533;series&#65533; were measured, of these 52 are male and 55 female, and there are 22 pairs (11 male pairs, 11 female pairs). The external traits measured comprise articular areas, femoral angles, diaphyseal dimensions, and anterior shaft curvature. In addition, pelvic dimensions for matching femora are recorded. Cross-sectional parameters derived from profile areas and second moments of area provide information on compressive strength, and bending rigidities and orientation at each cross-sectional level. Statistical methods employed are univariate F-ratios and Student&#65533;s t-test, bivariate correlation coefficients, and multivariate principal components, discriminant function, and linear regression.
	In this study of the pre-European Maori it is suggested that the normal developmental changes in femoral angles are prevented by extrinsic mechanical influences, such as habitual posture, high levels of physical activity, and greater musculature that alter growth plate morphogenesis. Femoral angles are &#65533;set&#65533; on epiphyseal fusion and have limited ability to remodel. The femoral diaphysis in the adult undergoes continual remodelling at the periosteal and endosteal surfaces and provides adaptive plasticity to mechanical loading at the hip and knee. Results indicate differences in absolute and relative values of external and cross-sectional traits that indicate mechanical loading patterns specific to each sex.
	Functional interpretation of inter-trait associations suggests that; 1) associations between external traits indicate the functional effect of growth and development on femoral size and shape characteristics. 2) Associations within cross-sectional parameters show relationships between appositional remodelling activity and structural strength. 3) Associations between external and internal traits indicate the importance of mechanical loading patterns established during growth and adulthood to final femoral morphology and subsequently to adaptive remodelling of the adult shaft.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">paleopathology</field><field name="subject">prehistoric peoples</field><field name="subject">physiology</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070601.094956</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Kaati Mamoe hapuu of Mahitahi : a question of mana?</field><field name="creator">Stevens, Emma</field><field name="description">Kaumaatua of the Te Koeti Turanga hapuu (sub-tribe) of South Westland have expressed concern that the mana of their Kaati Mamoe ancestors has been trampled on and their identity subsumed through union with the Kai Tahu tribal confederation. The history of the Kaati Mamoe iwi in the South island has been marginalised by the subsequent arrival of a number of hapuu of the Ngaati Kahungunu in the seventeenth century. The conflict which ensured following this gradual migration has traditionally been interpreted as marking the end of a Kaati Mamoe identity in the island. Complexity has been added to this situation as a result of European colonisation in the nineteenth century. The purchase by Pakeha of vast tracts of land in the South Island, and the failure to exempt the reserves promised, put pressure on the takata whenua&#65533;s land base and resources. The Crown&#65533;s refusal to acknowledge and redress the grievances of South Island Maori over the last hundred years has obliged the Kaati Mamoe to unite with the Kai Tahu. This process has served to further marginalise their identity, in this case in the southern rohe of the West Coast.
	The method that I have used in this work draws upon a number of disciplines. Oral history and written records of the Te Koeti hapuu form the central sources and to this extent this work may be described as being written from a Kaati Mamoe perspective. I have undertaken a review of the material recorded by European collectors of South Island Maori tradition in order to understand the way in which their reports have shaped the European view of South Westland Maori. And finally a review of the archaeological record has been included in order to provide information about the everyday material life of the ancestors of the South Westland hapuu.
	A number of conclusions have been reached in this thesis. Firstly that the peace arrangement at Popoutunoa which has been viewed by Kai Tahu as marking the end of a Kaati Mamoe identity is not necessarily the view of many Kaati Mamoe descendants. The historical record shows that a number of individuals continued to fight the Kai Tahu due to tribal differences while others continued to live alongside Kai Tahu in peace. As throughout much of Aotearoa, the importance of the hapuu as a source for an individual&#65533;s identity in Maori society prior to European colonisation has been over-shadowed. In the case of the South Westland people union with Kai Tahu, which was vital in the face of the loss of land, has been interpreted as the loss of their affiliation and identity with Kaati Mamoe.</field><field name="date">1994</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">Kati Mamoe</field><field name="subject">land use</field><field name="subject">land tenure</field><field name="subject">West Coast</field><field name="subject">Te Waipounamu</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070601.100136</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The recognition of Maori customary fisheries in New Zealand&#65533;s fisheries management regime : a case study of taiapure</field><field name="creator">Ririnui, Teneti</field><field name="description">The Treaty of Waitangi specifically recognises the rights of Maori to control and manage their fisheries resources. However, since the imposition of fisheries legislation in New Zealand, this right has been consistently eroded. It is only recently that Maori customary fisheries rights have been given a degree of recognition in New Zealand&#65533;s fisheries management regime.
	The taiapure provisions of the Fisheries Act 1996 are one of the few policy initiatives available for Maori to manage their fisheries resources in accordance with their customary tikanga. This study examines the effectiveness of the taiapure legislation in providing for Maori customary fisheries management. The Maketu taiapure in the Bay of Plenty is studied to analyse the implementation of the initiative at the local level.
	The study has found that there are limitations inherent in the legislation and that these are further complicated by inadequacies in its implementation.

Chapter one provides an overview of cervical cancer incidence in the world, followed by a more detailed analysis of the occurrence of cervical cancer in New Zealand and a discussion of the aetiological factors of cervical cancer. Cervical screening is discussed in Chapter two. The ethnic differences in incidence and mortality of cervical cancer between Maori and non-Maori and possible reasons for these differences are studied in Chapter three.
	Section B consists of the original work undertaken. A pilot study (Chapter four) was conducted to trial the methods for the national study (Chapter five). The national study was a retrospective review of the cervical smear histories of Maori women first diagnosed with invasive cervical cancer over a recent two year period in order to investigate why Maori women have not had their disease detected by screening and treated at the intraepithelial stage. Maori women&#65533;s knowledge of and attitudes towards cervical screening were obtained in a survey in Ruatoria (Chapter six).

The Sealords Deal (the Deal) as it is commonly known, is the first settlement in New Zealand which extinguishes Maori claims to a particular resource. It affects all iwi and proposes the development of a process for the allocation of benefits. As such it needs to be considered in terms of other post-colonial nations&#65533; experiences in the resolution of claims to natural resources.
	Canada, the United States and Australia provide examples of different attitudes and approaches to the resolution of claims to natural resources by their indigenous populations. A typical history of the resolution of claims to natural resources in post-colonial nations begins with initial European contact, followed by increased numbers of settlers which places pressure on governments and the judiciary to justify the acquisition and exploitation of land and other resources. This leaves the indigenous population landless and welfare dependent.
	This pattern is reflected in judicial decision-making. In New Zealand, the courts initially acknowledged that the rights of Maori to their lands and other resources, existed unless specifically taken away. When pressure for acquisition of land occurred the courts responded by holding that Maori rights to resources only existed if specifically granted by a court or the legislature. This reversed the original presumption of existence of a right unless taken away.
	It has only been recently that the New Zealand judiciary has reaccepted the common law doctrine of aboriginal title. This brings New Zealand more in line with Canada and the United States, but New Zealand still has some way to go in acknowledging the doctrine of fiduciary obligation of the Crown/government to Maori.
	It is also helpful to analyse the changes that have taken place in governments&#65533; policies that have enabled the creation of an enviroment in which such a settlement can take place. The Labour governments of 1984 and 1987 began a number of policy initiatives which created a socio-economic climate and responsive enviroment favourable to the settlement of such a claim.
	Changes are also occurring internationally. Indigenous people&#65533;s rights are coming to the fore with the proposed Universal Declaration on Indigenous Rights nearly in place.
	All this change at a national and international level has only been possible by post-colonial nations acknowledging their past in order to move to the future with confidence. The Sealords Deal is an example of an attempt by Maori and the New Zealand government to make this move forward.</field><field name="date">1993</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">indigenous peoples</field><field name="subject">resource management</field><field name="subject">aborignial title</field><field name="subject">fisheries</field><field name="subject">Aboriginal Australians</field><field name="subject">Native Americans</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070601.113012</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Urupare torohiko : planning for the equitable use of spatial information in the resolution of Treaty claims</field><field name="creator">Payne, V.R.J.

Lastly, a solution is proposed and discussed as a means of highlighting other possible solutions to the spatial information problems identified by the study.</field><field name="date">1992</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">Treaty of Waitangi</field><field name="subject">land tenure</field><field name="subject">claims</field><field name="subject">geographic information systems.</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070601.114135</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Stable isotopes and diet : indications of the marine and terrestrial component in the diets of prehistoric populations from New Zealand and the Pacific</field><field name="creator">Quinn, Carolyn J</field><field name="description">The importance of marine versus terrestrial foods in prehistoric Pacific and New Zealand diets, and the adaptation of the Polynesian diet to new enviroments, is examined through the analysis of the ratios in human bone of the stable isotopes of carbon, nitrogen and sulphur. In particular, this study seeks to obtain quantitative information which could provide answers to five main questions, relating to the subsistence focus of the early Lapita colonists in the Pacific, the significance of suger cane in the diets of early Pacific populations, the proportions of reef versus open ocean and terrestrial versus marine foods in these diets, and the identification of populations with pronounced marine or pronounced terrestrial diets.
	One hundred and nineteen samples of human bone from 13 sites throughtout the Pacific and New Zealand were processed. Nitrogen values were obtained directly from bone powder, while carbon values were determined from collagen produced by digesting bone powder in phosphoric acid. Sulphur evaluations were determined from a BaSo&#8308; precipitate, produced after combustion of the collagen samples in a Parr bomb.
	Interpretation of results is approached from a comparative point of view, which enables the proportions of marine and terrestrial foods in the diets of each study group to be assessed in relation to the diets of all the other groups. Additional information on the composition of the diets is gained by comparing the stable isotope values obtained in this study with published values of other human populations, and of marine and terrrestrial plants and animals.
	The potential of stable isotope analysis to identify the composition of prehistoric New Zealand and Pacific diets is confirmed. A unique marine adaptation is revealed from the analysis of the Chatham Islands Moriori who appear to have focused almost exclusively on marine resources. In contrast, a highly terrestrial diet is suggested for groups from Nebira in Papua New Guinea and Lake Rotoiti in New Zealand.</field><field name="date">1990</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">Papua New Guinea</field><field name="subject">prehistoric peoples</field><field name="subject">Oceania</field><field name="subject">diet</field><field name="subject">archaeology</field><field name="subject">strontium</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070601.115004</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Maori women of Otago District, 1874-1936 : an exploratory essay</field><field name="creator">Ojinmah, Simbo</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the situation of Maori women in Otago District between 1874 and 1936. Their situation is indeed unique in that there was a higher level of intermarriage during this period than in the North Island.
	The focus is on population decline and its recovery, health, alienation of the land, poverty, education and what effect all these had on the women. It has been extremely difficult to expand further because of limited sources of information, mainly the Appendices to the Journals of the House of Representatives and pieces of information scattered in official reports. Oral history interviews have been combined with appropriate photographs to illustrate the issues raised.
	The conclusion rested on the fact that a lot of these women were little different from North Island Maori women at this period, despite the high level of intermarriage. This is because they lost most of their land and became economically marginalised like the North Island Maoris.</field><field name="date">1989</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">women</field><field name="subject">Otago</field><field name="subject">history</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070601.115759</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies of Phormium tenax fibre prepared in the traditional Maori manner</field><field name="creator">Twose, Megan Frances</field><field name="description">Museum textiles provide priceless documentation of the activities of people throughout time. They record human interests and serve as resources for students of many disciplines. In New Zealand there are artefacts made from Phormium tenax which are extremely important in terms of providing a record of early New Zealand life and links to our past as both artistic and cultural symbols: they present an insight into the many faceted nature of early Maori culture. However there are some which are clearly in need of preservative treatment. Others may need care in the future for inevitably they are, or will be, subject to degradation during storage, when on display and during cleaning and refurbishing. Conservators, who embark occasionally on restorative treatments designed to reverse or arrest the symptoms of degradation, have begun to address the causes and future fundamental affects of their procedures. However there have been few scientific studies of the properties of the fibres and, therefore, there is little information to help the conservators in their tasks.
	This study has a twofold purpose. The first aim is to provide a short survey of the literature on Phormium and relate it to other lignocellulosic fibres. The emphasis in the survey is to put the conservation problem in context and to point to those technical articles which may be relevant to someone dealing with ancient materials. Secondly there is a practical study of the impact of heating the fibres in the absence and presence of oxygen and in water. These two agencies are ones which are directly relevant to the conservator.</field><field name="date">1988</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Harakeke</field><field name="subject">Phormium tenax</field><field name="subject">flax</field><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">preservation</field><field name="subject">textiles</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070619.110247</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A comparative study of the material culture of Murihiku</field><field name="creator">Gumbley, Warren</field><field name="description">This thesis is an attempt to assess the degree of differentiation between two regions, Otago and Southland, to be found in the styles of four types of artefact; Bird-spear points, One-piece fish-hooks, Composite hook points, Adzes.

Increasingly, writers from the indigenous race in these former colonies have felt moved to respond to these tensions in their imaginative fiction. This study has undertaken a comparative cross-cultural analysis of the works of two writers from such societies whose indigenous cultures share common assumptions, to explore the underlying impetus of these tensions, and the writers&#65533; proposals for resolving them.
	Chapter One assesses Witi Ihimaera as a writer, and explores his concept of biculturalism, with particular emphasis on the distinctly Maori point of view which informs his analysis of contemporary social problems.
	Chapter Two assays Ihimaera&#65533;s pastoral writings, Pounamu Pounamu, Tangi, and Whanau, tracing in them the development of his concept of biculturalism, and also the changes in Ihimaera&#65533;s writing that culminated in The new Net Goes Fishing, with the hardening of attitude that it expresses.
	Chapter Three looks at the revisionism of Ihimaera&#65533;s view of New Zealand history from a Maori viewpoint. It uses Ihimaera&#65533;s The Matriarch not only as a means of exploring this revisionist Maori perspective, but also as evidence of the radicalisation of Ihimaera&#65533;s views, and the broadening of the concept of biculturalism to embrace not only cultural, but social and political matters.
	Chapter Four considers Ihimaera&#65533;s The Whale Rider as a feminist restatement of earlier views and highlights the growing dilemma he faces concerning the concept of biculturalism.
	Chapter Five focuses on Achebe, the writer, and his view of the role of the African writer in contemporary society. It argues that Achebe views himself as a seer, a visionary writer who has the answer that could regenerate his society.
	Chapter Six analyses Achebe&#65533;s Things Fall Apart and Arrow of God, and argues that contrary to accepted views of Okonkwo, this character is not actually representative of his society but a deviant. It further argues that the post-colonial African societies&#65533; affictions with irresponsible leaders were already manifest in the colonial period, through characters such as Okonkwo and Ezeulu, whom Achebe sees as guilty of gross abuses of power and privilege.
	Chapter Seven looks at both No Longer at Ease and A Man of the People, and argues that the failure of the first indigenous administrative class stems both from their having an incomplete apprehension of all the aspects of their heritage and the responsibility which power imposes on those who exercise it, and also from lack of restraint in wielding of power. It further argues that the unbridled scramble for materialism has resulted in the destruction of democratic principles.
	In the context of contemporary New Zealand society, Ihimaera sees the solution for Maori post-colonial tensions as bicultural integration, but he is having problems with the concept in the face of increasing radical activism from Maoris who see it as little better than assimilation. Achebe, however, has opted for re-formism, having discarded traditionalism because it is inadequate for people in the modern world.</field><field name="date">1988</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Literature</field><field name="subject">colonisation</field><field name="subject">indigenous peoples</field><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">Nigeria</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070619.113620</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dietary intake and incidence of dietary related health conditions in a sample of Dunedin Maori women</field><field name="creator">Barber, Glenda M</field><field name="description">Throughout the twentieth century, Maori life expectancy for both men and women has increased significantly. For most health conditions however, medical statistics show that the Maori mortality rate remains significantly higher than the rate for the NZ non-Maori population.
	The results of epidemiological studies show that some of these health conditions may be environmentally induced. There appears to be a high incidence of obesity in the Maori population which has been related to dietary intake, with an associated high incidence of diabetes, heart disease and hypertension. These conditions appear to be particularly prevalent among Maori women.
	It is thought that the Maori population are gentically susceptible to obesity; a trait which manifests itself when there is a plentiful food supply in the population.
	At present, there is very little information available about the dietary intake of the Maori population, or the effect of diet upon obesity and associated health disorders in this group.
	The aim of this survey was to obtain information about the dietary intake of a sample of Dunedin Maori women using the diet history method of assessment. Also to determine the incidence of obesity and other dietry related health conditions in this group.
	Chapter 2 reviews the change in food habits and health status of the Maori population over the last two centuries, as well as reviewing the different methods by which information for dietary surveys is obtained.
	After setting out the methods and findings of the survey, Chapter 5 discusses the results in light of information obtained from similar dietary studies of NZ women. The samples intake is compared to recommended nutrient allowances for NZ women and the incidence of dietary related health disorders is also discussed.
	Overall, Dunedin Maori women&#65533;s diet was not deficient in any of the recorded nutrients. Dunedin Maori women, in their middle years, exhibited substantially higher energy intakes than middle years non-Maori women in the 1977 National Dietary Survey. The level of Dunedin Maori women&#65533;s carbohydrate intake was the main contributing factor for this higher energy intake. Dunedin Maori women over 50 years of age exhibited substantially higher energy intakes than NZ women aged 50-54 years in the 1985 Timaru Health District Survey, with an overall higher consumption of carbohydrate, protein and fat. Over half of Dunedin Maori were classified as overweight or very overweight. Hypertension and diabetes were reported, and obesity was commonly found among women with these health conditions. Over half of Dunedin Maori women used cigarettes, the majority using between ten and thirty cigarettes per day.
	Dunedin Maori women are relatively isolated from the more densely populated areas of North Island Maori. As a result, the survey results cannot be interpreted as characteristic of NZ Maori women in general. The significance of these findings is rather the elucidation of a regional situation. Further studies of Maori women in both rural and urban areas of the North and South Island are necessary to determine if an overall pattern of high intake exists with a deleterious impact upon the health of Maori women.</field><field name="date">1988</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Diet</field><field name="subject">food</field><field name="subject">health</field><field name="subject">hauora</field><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">women</field><field name="subject">wahine</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070619.114420</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Maori schools of New Zealand, 1930-1945 : a critical examination of the policies which lead [i.e., led] to their renewal</field><field name="creator">McKean, John Charles</field><field name="description">The chief argument of this study of major reforms within Maori schools is that while their curriculum was updated and morale restored, all educational developments were predicated upon the Maori people remaining a rural, dependent people.
	In the background to schooling changes were two expressions of nationalism within New Zealand: Attempts of the Dominion, at an official level, to assert its independence, moves made more urgent by the Depression, and secondly, the growing sense of the Maori people of their racial and cultural heritage. These significant changes were joined by a clutch of moves which propelled the Maori people into the national economy.
	The chief architects of schooling changes would have considered their work made a major break with the past. In reality it continued a tradition embedded in the nineteenth century in which education was regarded as a means of social control. As such, this paternalistic stance originated from British colonial theory, and from the purposes defined for education of the so-called lower classes. Partial reinterpretations of the tradition emerged in the growing practice of setting aside reserves for native education, from E G Wakefield&#65533;s theories, and the highly influential stance of John Thornton, Headmaster of Te Aute Collage. In a theory novel for the nineteenth century, Thornton held that Maoris should be so educated that they might fill any job or profession.
	Douglas Ball, appointed Inspector in 1928, was a domineering presence within Maori Schools. The substantial support of unique, creative government projects to make productive farms of Maori traditional lands were joined to Ball&#65533;s promotion of the tenets of Progrssive Education, and the then-novel introduction of Maoritanga in the curricululum. Education and social philosophies so espoused were derivative; the former from the &#65533;child-centredness&#65533; of Progressive Education, the latter, from the late colonial theory of adaptionism.
	Schooling renewal and land development attracted bi-partisan support. Ball received further support from international colleagues. It was the demise of the Proficiency Examinaton, however, that enabled education to be pressed into a vocational pattern, and with it, moves to link school and community.
	This renewal received limited challenge until officials pressed for reforms and expansion of secondary education on a vocational basis. Pressure on Denominational Schools to virtually abandon academic courses was exceedingly unpopular, as were the turns the development of the Native District High Schools took: Maori families had become aware that a good life on the land was not possible for all. They also felt the vocational slant was an insult to Maori aspiration for better jobs and recognized status within New Zealand. Maori opposition to this form of education was an appropriate response to its limitations. This study concludes, however, given the paucity of articulate critics a no-contest situation emerged in face of strongly-held stereotypes and the bureaucratic vigour of an Education Department bent on implementing &#65533;progressive&#65533; policies.</field><field name="date">1987</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">education</field><field name="subject">schools</field><field name="subject">history</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070619.120057</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Moa and moa hunting : an archaeological analysis of big game hunting in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Kooyman, Brian P</field><field name="description">This study is an archaeological examination of the prehistoric hunting of moa, a family (Dinornithidae) of now extinct large flightless birds that inhabited New Zealand. The analysis employs a detailed butchering pattern analysis for the moa remains and combines it with a lithic usewear microchipping and polish analysis. The usewear analysis examines two lithic materials, porcellanite and silcrete. The criteria used to distinguish worked material in the usewear study. The general patterns of moa exploitation and butchering are defined in a faunal analysis of moa remains from sites from throughout New Zealand. Hunting strategies are examined in a case study of the Clutha River area of southern New Zealand, by interpreting the results of the butchering pattern analysis in combination with the usewear analysis results and some of the general aspects of site type and location. It is concluded that moa were hunted by an individual hunting strategy, probably with wooden spears. Hunting was done from habitation sites, not from temporary camps established from base camps. Hunting did not specialise in any one particular moa species. In addition to meat, bone marrow was also particular moa species. In addition to meat, bone marrow was also extracted and eaten. No evidence of meat preservation was found. The results correspond well with expectations based on analogies from traditional hunting of other large birds and in east Polynesia, suggesting the methodology is reliable for studying hunting and could be applied elsewhere.
	The study also includes an examination of bone anatomical landmarks as a means to identifying moa species. The hypothesised significance of the variation in these traits is used to make suggestions about possible moa behaviour. It is suggested that Megalapteryx didinus was more awkward than the other moa, that Anomalopteryx didiformis may have had a diet more similar to that of the kiwi than to that of the other moa, and that Dinornis species may have balanced their centre of gravity differently from other moa. Based on the manner in which moa were hunted, it is proposed that moa did not congregate in large flocks.</field><field name="date">1985</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Moa</field><field name="subject">hunting</field><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">South Island</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070619.121632</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Seasonality in prehistoric Murihiku : the evidence from oxygen isotope ratios</field><field name="creator">Till, Michael</field><field name="description">Assessing the timing of seasonal movements by the prehistoric peoples of Otago has long been a problem in the archaeology of this region.

In this work carbonate samples from the blue mussel (Mytilus edulis) were used to estimate the seasonality of four prehistoric fishing sites. A total of 275 samples of shell material were analysed for carbon and oxygen isotope ratios at the Institute of Nuclear Sciences, Lower Hutt.

The translation of Christian experience in the local religious terms would have become beneficial to the Maori Christians. This dissertation is the outcome of library research so that the views expressed are the result of materials consulted. There may have been other up to date materials however with limited time required for such investigation they were not able to be consulted and those consulted may not have been interpreted correctly. However, an attempt had been made in order to interest others for further investigation to encourage and build the Church of God among the Maoris.
	The attempt made in the following pages was to identify the function of tapu in Maori society in the past and the present and its influence in Christian belief and experience today. To identify tapu experience in Maori Christianity today we have tried to define tapu as it was present in the past religious belief and practise and as it is maintained today. Tapu as protective prohibitions in the past continue to influence Christian belief and practise in the present day. In the second section we have tried to identify the source of tapu. The sacredness or tapu originated from Io the supreme being which was bestowed upon the first born male child of human being by Tane through the three baskets of knowledge and the sacred stones.

Nga Roimata O Hine-nui-te-po literally means the tears of Hine-nui-te-po (the guardian of dead). It is a phrase associated with death but not always with grief. Sadness is involved as the deceased is leaving the living but it can also imply joy as the deceased is returning home (Kainga) to the place of ancestral origin (Hawaiki). Death was and is seen as the focal point of Maori life. It was the axis around which the actions of the living revolved. It was a time of mourning but also a time of happiness as it witnessed the birth of an ancestor.
	This study firstly discusses traditional Maori death customs in relation to traditional Maori society. The topic has obvious limitations. The reliance on unverified records, often based on second-hand hearsay, is hopefully balanced, to some degree, by authenticated information and some material provided by recent archaeological reconstruction. Discussion with contemporary informants was also of valuable assistance.
	Secondly the thesis attempts to provide an under-standing as to why Maori culture has survived despite over one and a half centuries of intensive outside influence. The study of death in both its past and present Maori contexts points to the reason for the continuity of Maoritanga being held within Maori attitudes toward death. Maoritanga can only be understood via an appreciation of tangihanga. Maoritanga did and does have tangihanga as its very heart.

E. (Robert Edward)</field><field name="description">In comparing the semantic structures of Maori and English, differences were found between the two languages in the way in which binary complements partition the universe of discourse. Furthermore, these structural principles which differed for Maori and English turned out to be contingent upon the separate development of the two languages and transferable from one language to the other by the native speakers of each language. As a consequence, it is possible to explain how Maori and Pakeha interpretations of society can differ considerably even when English is the only medium of communication used. Two examples were taken to demonstrate that this hypothesis can lead to alternative interpretations of both traditional and contemporary social situations. Firstly, Maori semantic structures can provide an alternative and parsimonious account of the canoe traditions and secondly, it raises interesting possibilities for a reconsideration of the educational processes which are important to Maori people both within their own social context and within the state education system.</field><field name="date">1981</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">language</field><field name="subject">English</field><field name="subject">cross cultural communication</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070619.130829</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The study of protohistoric Maori material culture : methods, resources and preliminary hypotheses.</field><field name="creator">Butts, David James</field><field name="description">An interdisciplinary approach to the study of change and retention in Maori material culture during the protohistoric is recommended. The principal disciplines involved are history, ethnology, ethnography and archaeology. Each exploits a different research resource and together in synthesis they can offer a more comprehensive understanding of culture change. This study concentrates on the material culture subsystem of Maori culture; yet it can only be effectively studied if the relationship between this subsystem and others is unravelled. Hence the need for an interdisciplinary methodology.
	&#65533;Classic&#65533; Maori material culture is briefly outlined in Chapter One. Historical aspects of the protohistoric period are discussed in Chapter Two. Chapter Three outlines the various potential sources of interdisciplinary input in a study of contact period Maori material culture change and assesses contributions made to this study by other researchers. Chapter Four summarizes the major themes of retention and adaptation in relation to particular aspects of post-contact Maori material culture change in the protohistoric period are outlined in Chapter Five.
	This study has taken a generalized approach to a problem which has a number of different regional manifestations. A framework is provided within which detailed regional assessments can be made. Such studies will be the most effective way of testing whether the hypotheses derived from this research are adequate to explain the changes, retentions and adaptations in Maori material culture during the protohistoric period.</field><field name="date">1981</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">social life and customs</field><field name="subject">material culture</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070619.131638</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Horticulture in prehistoric New Zealand : an investigation of the function of the stone walls of Palliser Bay</field><field name="creator">Leach, Helen M</field><field name="description">Low stone rows and alignments were reported as early as 1904 on the coastal platform of eastern Palliser Bay. In all subsequent references it was assumed that the features were horticultural and, on the grounds of their appearance, of considereable age. Methodical investigation of these claims within the context of a three year archaeological programme (1969-1972) including analysis of prehistoric settlements, economy, and physical anthropology, was regarded as a worthwhile project, since orthodox opinion at the time favoured a later introduction of Polynesian horticulture some centuries after initial settlement of New Zealand about the 9th century AD.
	Extensive field surveys showed that at least 93ha of the coastal platform between Whatarangi and Cape Palliser had been subject to stone clearance according to several simple principles, such as equal access to the best soils, maintenance of a rectilinear system, and the clear separation of individual plots with boundary markers and paths. In addition, excavations conducted within the major complexes revealed artiificial deepening of the prehistoric topsoil, frequent incorporation of wood charcoal, rare addition of beach gravel, and inclusion of domestic refuse where the walls were adjacent to coastal villages. Both radio-carbon dates and artefacts found in association with the stone structures indicate early establishment of horticulture on this coast by the 12th century AD with an apparent peak of activity and complexity of garden system before the beginning of the 15th century, followed by decline and virtual abandonment.
	Climatic conditions prevailing in Palliser Bay today preclude cultivation of all Polynesian cultigens except the kumara (Ipomoea batatas) and gourd (Lagenaria siceraria). It is now accepted that mean annual temperature at the time of settlement was 1&#65533; - 2&#65533;C higher. Even so, growing season length and rainfall would probably not have been adequate for crops such as taro or yam.
	Within New Zealand, the kumara gardens of Palliser Bay find close parallels on both sides of Cook Strait, and on the eastern coast of the Wairarapa. Similar principles of garden layout applied in the larger Auckland wall complexes, and in 18th century gardens north of Hawkes Bay. From a survey of tropical Polynesian garden structures it appears that an extensive repertoire of horticultural techniques was introduced by the first settlers to temperate New Zealand and despite the loss of variety in cultigens it persisted until the 18th century as a viable means of subsistence.</field><field name="date">1976</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">horticulture</field><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">gardening</field><field name="subject">food cultivation</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070619.133750</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Stereotypes of Maori : influence of speaker accent and appearance</field><field name="creator">Holmes, Kelly</field><field name="description">Research has consistently shown that there are anumber of negative stereotypes held by Pakeha towards Maori. However, some of these studies have been flawed by low participant identification rates of Maori. Furthermore, none of these studies have examined the role of accent and appearance on evaluations when both pieces of information are presented together. The present study sought to address these limitations and to verify the current stereotypes associated with Maori. A videotape of eight speakers reading an identical short story was shown to one hundred and sixty-four high school students. Participants were assigned to one of two conditions. In the auditory presentation participants heard but did not see the speakers. In the visual presentation participants heard and saw the speakers. Of the eight speakers, half looked Pakeha and half looked Maori. Furthermore half spoke with a Maori English accent and half spoke with a Pakeha English accent. Results showed that use of Maori English speakers led to higher Maori identification rates by participants in the auditory presentation. Furthermore, for status variables and Maori in particular, accent appeared to amplify the evaluative effects of appearance. It was also found that the longstanding negative stereotypes of Maori still exist. Finally, though not the focus of the present study, it was found that overall younger and older high school students had similar evaluations of Maori and Pakeha. The implications of these results, particularly to the educational, employment and law enforcement sectors of society are discussed.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">Pakeha</field><field name="subject">ethnic attitudes</field><field name="subject">identity</field><field name="subject">speech</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070620.094023</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Coronary heart disease in New Zealand Maoris : an epidemiological study.</field><field name="creator">Beaglehole, R.

	Racial comparisons provide a valuable means of studing the epidemiology of CHD, as marked variation in the occurrence of CHD may occur in different races living in close proximity. Comparisons of New Zealand national mortality data do in fact indicate that the New Zealand Maori, especially the Maori female, is of relatively high risk of dying from CHD. This high risk status is in marked contrast to that of other Polynesian groups living more traditionally in which CHD is virtually unknown. Moreover, the high risk status of the New Zealand Maori would not have been predicted from a knowledge of their risk factor status. These two points, the high risk status of the Maori and their atypical risk factor pattern, provide the justification for this attempt to learn more about the occurrence and causation of CHD in New Zealand Maoris.</field><field name="date">1977</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">health</field><field name="subject">coronary heart disease</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070619.132849</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Prehistoric communities in Palliser Bay, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Leach, B. Foss</field><field name="description">A programme of archaeological research was undertaken in the Wairarapa region on the northern shores of Cook Strait, New Zealand. Some 27 excavations conducted during a 3 year period were designed primarily to examine prehistoric economy and settlement pattern in the region. In addition, studies were made of early historical records of Maori life, Maori traditional history, and aspects of the modern and prehistoric enviroment. In the analysis of excavated material, particular attention was given to physical anthropology, subsistence economy, and the trading patterns revealed by the importation of a number of rock types from elsewhere in New Zealand.
	It was found that human occupation in Palliser Bay was most intense from about 1150AD to 1400AD, and that significant depopulation may have occurred by 1650AD. At least 6 kinship linked communities were resident in this early period, probably originating from further north. Over several centuries thay strengthened their social ties with other communities in Cook Strait, progressively losing contact with northern areas. A conjunctive picture is reconstructed of a typical community of 30 to 40 people, and aspects of their physical condition, economy, technology, settlement pattern, external social relationships and ideology described. Their economy was initially a balance between hunter-gatherer pursuits and kumara-based horticulture, but in the course of time their forest clearing activities set into motion a series of episodes of erosion which culminated in the development of broad shingle river beds and active fans. High riverine sediment loads led to the loss of much of the local marine fauna at river mouths. A general climatic deterioration about 1450AD and then from 1600 onwards accelerated this process to render the enviroment largely unsuitable to Polynesian habitation. It is argued that coupled to these changes are settlement pattern modifications and an increase in human disease and malnutrition.</field><field name="date">1976</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">antiquities</field><field name="subject">excavations</field><field name="subject">archaeology</field><field name="subject">Wairarapa</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070620.100439</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The impact of metal technology on the Maori of Northland</field><field name="creator">Aitken, J.

The possibility of recognising such changes from archaeological data is explored.
	Chapter One comprises a discussion of the comparative efficiency and effectiveness of metal and non-metal tools. Data from archaeological experiments and ethnographic accounts are used for this purpose. To illustrate the differences between a non-metal and a metal technology and the changes that accrue from the introduction of the latter, ethnographic and ethnohistorical accounts of the impact of metals on other societies are put forward in Chapter Two.
	Chapters Three and Four present a review of the prehistoric economy, technology and settlement patterns in Northland, so that the extent and nature of changes that occurred during the protohistoric period may be assessed. In Chapter Five, the conditions under which the Maori obtained metal tools are outlined in order to elicit the changing Maori attitudes toward, and evaluation of, particular metal items.
	Chapters Six and Seven review the changes that occurred in Northland during the protohistoric period, principally between 1803 and 1840. Prior to 1803, the quanity of metal in Maori hands was insufficient to effect changes in their way of life, and there is little evidence to suggest that they altered their traditional activities because of a desire to obtain metal goods. After 1840, many Maori had had [sic] such prolonged contact with Europeans that it would be difficult to attribute any changes in Maori society solely to the introduction of a metal technology.

Chapter 1. Cultural continuity and the archaeologist's use of ethnographic analogy.

There can be no doubt of the usefulness to New Zealand archaeologists of the confident knowledge that only Polynesians occupied this country, and that they did so for only a comparatively short time. While arguments for Melanesian or Western Polynesian cultural influence, or even a three or four thousand year time span may be noted, the widely held view of cultural continuity and a date for initial settlement perhaps a little more than a thousand years ago, is of crucial importance to the way archaeologists in this country view their primary information. This thesis explores the implications of the &#65533;confidence in the continuity of culture&#65533; by employing the &#65533;direct historical&#65533; ethnographic analogy.
	In addition, this work is also concerned with the &#65533;general comparative&#65533; ethnographic analogy. The difference between the terms &#65533;direct historical&#65533; and &#65533;general comparative&#65533; is significant not only for the variety of methods employed, but also because of the distinctiveness of their limitations. The &#65533;direct historical&#65533; analogy can be used only when there is demonstrable or assumed direct cultural continuity between archaeological information - the prehistoric group - and the ethnographic analogue. &#65533;General comparative&#65533; analogy draws upon a wide variety of cultural and behavioural models to generate hypotheses and interpretations of value to the archaeologist. Ascher (1961) restricts his &#65533;new analogy&#65533; to those archaeological areas for which historical continuity to the ethnographic present cannot be demonstrated. It is clear, however, that the concept of the general comparative analogy is more useful: it is frequently valuable to draw on a wide range of ethnographic observations and generalisations to reinforce particular historical analogues, and to offer interpretations for archaeological data for which there is no direct ethnographic insight.
	The problems of ethnographic analogy have recently come under some scrutiny. This examination involves what is perhaps the central methodological and theoretical issue for archaeology: the relation of excavated data to whatever model or framework is used in interpretation. A major result of this new look at the ethnographic analogy is the recognition that ethnographic observations do not provide the only source of interpretative hypotheses. A more eclectic approach is now favoured and ecology and the behavioural sciences are explored for insight into archaeological data, while systems theory and other frameworks are used in analysis. For example, Anderson (1973) uses a competition model developed by ecologists to explain changes in size frequency and species composition in four stratified midden sites. Clearly the notion that archaeology depends on ethnographic analogy for interpretation is no longer tenable. None the less, ethnographic analogy does remain the most important single source of interpretative models for archaeology...</field><field name="date">1974</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">archaeology</field><field name="subject">architecture</field><field name="subject">dwellings</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070620.132352</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The spatial distribution of Maori fertility in the North Island, 1955-1967.</field><field name="creator">Kyle, G. D</field><field name="description">Summary:
In the past population geographers have tended to concentrate excessively on the task of mapping, discussing, and explaining the geographical distribution and pattern of change associated with demographical distribution and pattern of change associated with demographic problems and situations found in the developed world, namely Europe and the Americas. (Zelinsky: 1961). During the past decade, however, increasing attention has been given to the dynamics of population structure. This is particularly evident in the case of geographical mobility, and a considerable body of knowledge has already been accumulated on the spatial distribution of mortality.
	Human fertility, too, has become a major focal point for research. Part of this interest has been stimulated by the world-wide problem of excessive and unevenly distributed population growth. This has been coupled with the realization that fertility is the paramount influence on population growth rates, both in situations of sharply declining mortality, as in the economically advanced nations, and already low death rates, as in much of the rest of the world. Indeed, it has been demonstrated that, in a closed population, it is only when substantial changes in fertility occur that major shifts in age-structure become evident.
	Theory relating to population dynamics, especially fertility, has developed largely from studies of Western populations. According to Zelinsky there are as few as two identifiable demographic paradigms in current use. These are the so-called Laws of Migration (Ravenstein: 1883) and the Theory of Demographic Transition. This concept appears to have been introduced by Thompson (1929) and has since been restated in numerous forms. Perhaps the most elaborate is that presented by Cowgill: 1962-63)...</field><field name="date">1974</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">fertility</field><field name="subject">population studies</field><field name="subject">demographics</field><field name="subject">census</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070621.130026</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Early Maori religious movements : a study of the reactions of the Maoris to the Christian Gospel up to 1860.</field><field name="creator">Begg, Alison Margaret</field><field name="description">Summary:

What was the nature of the problem? Definitions were conflicting. Most Maoris saw the problem as one of survival, political and cultural, in their encounter with a foreign civilization determined upon their subjugation. They looked to the King Movement to prevent the European takeover which they apprehended would destroy their, independence and way of life.
	To the average colonist, on the other hand, the problem represented the Maoris themselves: their very existence in the country which he had come to settle; their claimed ownership of the land which he wanted to farm; their inconvenient (to him) system of land tenure, which rendered purchase difficult; their ignorance and disregard of the laws and customs which governed his society. The solution, in his view, was to detribalize the Maoris, make them obedient to his rule, and individualize or partition their communally owned land in order to facilitate his gaining possession of it. He desired colonial control of native affairs so that such a policy might be put into effect, but was unwilling to assume full responsibility lest Britain should leave the colony to bear the entire burden of its own defence against the potentially hostile tribes.
	The Ministers of the Imperial Government were concerned with yet other aspects of the same problem - observing the Treaty of Waitangi and protecting the Queen&#65533;s Maori subjects from injustice without obstructing the progress of colonization; keeping the peace between two cultural groups whose interests were often antagonistic; upholding British law and sovereignty. A difficult enough task, but one rendered still more difficult by the growing reluctance of the British taxpayer to foot the bill.
	Finally, the Governor, the man who had to find some way to resolve these conflicting aims and desires, faced his own particular dilemmas. How much responsibility should he accept for native affairs? How much control should he allow the Colonial Ministry to arrogate to itself. What interpretation should he place on the Treaty of Waitangi with respect to the rights of chiefs and the sovereignty of the Queen? By what means could he "civilize" the Maoris and bring about their assimilation into colonial society? Should he impose or persuade, legislate, educate, or conquer by force of arms? How was he to obtain the finance and power necessary to carry out any policy successfully?

	These are the opening lines of the Preface to a recently published selection of Maori myths and legends in translation: they indicate how strongly many modern New Zealanders are attracted to the various forms of Maori literature. But this is no new phenomen. For the receptive Pakeha mind has been fascinated by Maori mythology since the very beginnings of European settlement in New Zealand. Indeed, if anything, the magnetic appeal of Maori myth and legend was probably most evident in the earliest years of intercultural contact.
	Thomas Kendall was one of the first missionaries to work among the Maori people. Unlike most of his fellow-evangelists, Kendall determined to study and so understand the religion and customs of his adopted flock. Unfortunately, this &#65533;tragic, Faustian figure&#65533; was soon out of his depth. Kendall wrote,
	I am now, after a long, anxious, and painful study, arriving at the very foundation and groundwork of the cannibalism and superstitions of these islanders. All their notions are metaphysical, and I have been so poisoned withh the apparent sublimity of their ideas that I have been almost completely turned from a Christian to a heathen.
	Another early missionary, Richard Taylor, also studied Maori beliefs in depth. But Taylor, though he felt impelled by his inter-course with the Maori to write a long and influential treatise on his interpretation of Maoritanga, did manage to retain a degree of scholarly objectivity towards his subject. Yet even so, Taylor acknowledges in his treatise that,
	The Maori mythology is extremely interesting, and quite different from what we should expect from a people sunk in barbarism. ... Their ideas in some respects are not so puerile, as those even of the more civilized heathens of old, and without the light of inspiration, could not be expected to be more advanced.
	Nor were secular scholars immune to "Maori fever." Sir George Grey wrote of the Maori that &#65533; their traditions are puerile&#65533; and their &#65533;religious faith ... is absurd&#65533;. Yet during the eight years that he was Governor of the nascent colony of New Zealand in a period of constant interracial stress, Grey devoted a great deal of what little spare time he had to the collection and publication of the myths and legends, and &#65533;the ancient traditional poems, religious chants, and songs, of the Maori race&#65533;-- Introduction.

J. F.  (Peter J. F.)</field><field name="description">Summary: European colonial expansion during the past five centuries has had serious repercussions for many indigenous populations. Responses to intrusive European culture have varied. Aboriginal Tasmanian culture was extinguised (Plomley 1966). The Cheyenne (Ho&#776;ebel 1964) and the Mapuche Indians (Faron 1968) have struggled to retain their identity and their compromises with European culture have been grudging. Many indigenous societies have been ravaged by disease and warfare and others have been transformed into a culture with both European and indigenous elements. Then there are the Swazi (Kuper 1964), who are continuing, at the present time to adjust to colonialist regimes. The New Zealand Maori have adopted elements of European culture without losing a distinctive cultural identity (Metge 1968).
	Details of events following initial contact between indigenous societies and Europeans are obscure, usually because of poor documentation. Yet it is precisely this initial period of culture contact that is often of particular interest to anthropologists. Until recently, accounts of culture contact have been left to historians, political scientists, ethnographers and social anthropologists. Archaeologists have tended to overlook this area of research, probably on the assumption that it is already well documented. However, the study of recent culture-contact situations is clearly the provenance of archaeology as well as other disciplines (Sturtevant 1966 : 41). Indeed, one of the major attractions of post-contact archaeology is the very fact that there are usually some relevant data from non-archaeological disciplines (op.cit.: 42-3).
	There are several self-evident areas of potential research in post-contact archaeology. Historical documentation may be used to locate archaeological sites (Pilling 1968; Trigger 1969); ethnic groups may be traced back into the late prehistoric period from the ethnographic present by using the "direct historical approach" (see Sturtevant 1966: 9; Hall 1969; Stewart 1942; Stewart 1969; Wright 1968); the effects of culture contact (Oswalt and van Stone 1967) or the expansion of the colonial settlements (Allen 1967; No&#776;el Hume 1963) may be the principal foci; and there is also the possibility of projecting cultural adaptations back into the late prehistoric part (Fitting and Cleland 1969) in order to discover the corresponding cultural patterns.
	The present study will consider culture change induced by contact with an intrusive culture. The indigenous culture is New Zealand Maori, the intrusive culture, European.</field><field name="date">1972</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Indigenous peoples</field><field name="subject">archaeology</field><field name="subject">acculturation</field><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">Te Waipounamu</field><field name="subject">Kai Tahu</field><field name="subject">Kati Mamoe</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070622.110157</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The interaction of a personal health service with Maori and Pacific islander families in central Auckland.</field><field name="creator">Christmas, Bryan William</field><field name="description">During a 12-months period from 1 April 1966 to 31 March 1967 all infants born of Maori and Polynesian Pacific islander parentage domiciled within the Auckland Health District were included in a longitudinal infant health survey, and those that came under the supervision of the public health nurses in the district were followed up wherever practicable for a period of 12 months.

(Foss)</field><field name="description">The concept of similarity has occupied a key position in the interpretation of archaeological evidence since Thomson&#65533;s Three Age System was formulated (Thomsen, 1836). Indeed, the writing of prehistory demands the use of this concept in relating evidence from stratigraphically distant horizons. Taylor, however, not only argued that too much emphasis could be placed on this comparative approach, but also claimed that it could be detrimental to the full recovery of archaeological information (W.W. Taylor, 1948). A similar dissatisfaction in Britain prompted Clark (1964, 1966, 1967) to adopt a &#65533;conjunctive approach&#65533; (W.W. Taylor, 1948:7) exemplified in their work as economic prehistorians. This reappraisal however, has increased rather than diminished the need for procedured designed to relate assemblages in cultural terms. While the development of methods of analysis which assess the similarity between comparable items of different assemblages proceeds, it is stressed that sound theoretical principles, whereby the results of such analyses may be interpreted in the most plausible manner, must be adopted. Indeed it is urged that the common assumption that the degree of cultural similarity is directly proportional to the formal similarity, is by no means universally valid.
	Considerable advances have recently been made in developing techniques to identify formal relationships by establishing the degree of &#65533;proximity&#65533; between different assemblages of information. The ancillary problem of interpreting results in cultural terms has received relatively less attention.
	This dissertation considers the application of methods of &#65533;proximity&#65533; analysis to specific New Zealand assemblages, together with a discussion of the problems encountered in interpretation.

One aspect of this has been the prolonged discussion of the cultural status of the New Zealand Maori during the &#65533;Classic Maori Phase&#65533;. In part this was stimulated by an increase in knowledge of the earlier Archaic period (Duff, 1956:73-82). It was also influenced by a widespread interest in the records of early voyagers and travellers encouraged by the wealth of new editions available (for example, the Beaglehole editions of the journals of Cook and Banks).
	The inadequacies of the archaeological assemblages belonging to this phase were acknowledged at the Second Annual Conference of the New Zealand Archaeological Association (Golson, 1957:279). Consequently, many prehistorians began to regard these records as supplementary information. Observations made by Europeans, as visitors or residents in New Zealand were compiled in order to delineate the differences between the earlier and later phases of New Zealand prehistory (Golson, 1957:279-280; Golson and Gathercole, 1962:271).
	The past seven years have been seen a marked upsurge of interest in the precise details of culture contact between European and Maori during the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. This period of initial contact was named the &#65533;protohistoric&#65533; period of Maori culture in line with the terminology adopted overseas (Golson and Gathercole, 1962:173). The French, who differentiated between the prehistoric period when writing was non-existent, and the historic period when cultural developments could be studied with the aid of written documents, introduced the term &#65533;protohistoric&#65533; to mark the early historic period when written documents were occasionally produced, but not on a universal scale (Hawkes, 1951: 1, 3)--Chapter One.</field><field name="date">1972</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">Wairarapa</field><field name="subject">antiquities</field><field name="subject">history</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070622.084801</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Settlement in the south east Bay of Islands, 1772 : a study in text-aided field archeology.</field><field name="creator">Kennedy, Jean</field><field name="description">Field archaeology is the study of surface features of archaeological sites (Crawford 1960: 36). It is concerned not only with the location of sites for excavation, but with their distributions and relationships in time and space. A sequence of field monuments in an area can be difficult to reconstruct, as the information necessary for dating of sites may be not be obtainable from interpretation of surface features alone. The landscape, on which human activities may leave visible traces, is palimpsestic (ibid: 51) : human activity may erase previous traces, or merely add to them. Superposition of remains, resulting from the continued occupation of a particular location, may not necessarily leave visible traces, and if it does, the traces may represent an accumulation of activities, or the remains of only the most recent. A landscape may include sites representing human occupation at different times in the past.

	The survival of traces of activity as archaeological surface features depends on the extent to which natural features of the landscape are permanently modified. The recognition of these traces depends on the ability of the field archaeologist to interpret the landscape. The geographical context of archaeological sites is the present-day landscape, but study of the site necessitates consideration both of this context and also of environmental features obtaining at the time the site was occupied. Reconstruction and interpretation of both landscape and site are necessary: the site, once the human activity leading to its recognition by the field archaeologist has ceased, is subject to the same agents of change as the landscape.
	The interpretation of archaeological sites rests chiefly on excavation. Once a type of site has been examined throughly by excavation, the resulting interpretations may be transferred to other similar, but unexcavated sites. Such inferences can be very specific, or quite general.

(Helen)</field><field name="description">Summary: It is widely accepted that it is impossible to write prehistory on the basis of the results of archaeological excavation alone. Whether the aims of prehistoric re-construction are to write the &#65533;anthropology of dead peoples&#65533; (Heizer and Graham, 1967), or to explore the dynamics of culture history (Chang, 1967), such re-construction necessitates the use of additional non-archaeological data. Although some disagreement exists over the most salutory means of applying the results of research in the social and natural sciences, there is little doubt that prehistory benefits from the association.
	This dissertation, which was undertaken to assess the role of supplementary data in New Zealand prehistoric research, employs two types of non-archaeological evidence: ethnographical-historical data, and methods for assessing subsistence activities from scientific data. These involve not only a study of relevant written records, but also of regional and seasonal distribution of food resources.</field><field name="date">1968</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">food</field><field name="subject">ethnology</field><field name="subject">prehistoric economics</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070622.135252</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Maori chant : a study in ethnomusicology</field><field name="creator">McLean, Mervyn</field><field name="description">Summary: Few people know that there are two kinds of Maori music. The kind with which most people are familiar - known as Action Song - dates from perhaps the first or second decade of this century. In its present form it is little more than a Maorified form of Western popular music.
	The other kind of Maori music has a long tradition dating back to the beginnings of the Maori people. Even today it remains associated with the old values and institutions of Maoridom. It exhibits, in consequence, great tenacity of style.
	It is with the older form of music that this thesis is concerned.
	Since, so far as the writer is aware, there is no generally accepted name which incorporates the whole of the older song tradition, it will be called here Maori chant. This term is used as inclusive of waiata, patere, pao, and all the other forms discussed.

Cumberland wrote the first geographical treatise on pre-20th century Maori settlement and livelihood in New Zealand, twenty-five major geographical studies on various aspects of the topic have been published. Of these, nine have been concerned with the nature of settlement, population distribution, and economy, as they varied from one area to another within New Zealand at given points in time. A further five studies, concerned with the historical geography of New Zealand in general, contain very brief accounts concerning the distribution of Maori population and the nature of the Maori economy in the 19th century. Four studies, relying on early European observations, have focused on the character of Maori settlement in particular regions: North West Nelson, Westland, Taupo County, and Tauranga County. Another study has analysed the nature of Maori land sales and the effect these had on the 19th century Maori population of one area in the North Island. One study has considered in detail the affect the so called &#65533;moa hunter&#65533; settlement had on the forests of the east coast of the South Island. And finally, five studies have focused on the nature and changes in Maori agriculture in the North Island from the late 18th to the 19th century-- Chapter 1.</field><field name="date">1969</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">South Island</field><field name="subject">Murihiku</field><field name="subject">history</field><field name="subject">settlement</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070622.134552</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Makutu : a study in the ethnopsychiatry of the Maori, past and present.</field><field name="creator">Gluckman, L.

Some of the factors which have led to the perpetuation of Makutu are discussed.

Of these, only two (Nos. 20 and 21) show obvious signs of European influence and this was acknowledged in both cases. The remaining songs must be regarded as genuine examples of indigenous Maori music. They display many of the characteristics common to the music of native races throughtout the world but as will be shown many characteristics also which are uniquely Maori.
	The subject matter of the thesis is solely concerned with the songs recorded and with facts made known to me by informants. Instrumental music, which is now virtually extinct is not treated here. The historical approach through existing writings on Maori music has also been deliberately neglected. For this reason I have not thought it necessary to include the usual bibliography.
	Announcements concerning the songs were mostly made by the performers themselves in the Maori language. Performers were asked to give the name and type of song, own name and tribe, name and tribe of composer and anything they could recall of interest about the history and background of the song. If essential information was left out it was an elicited by question and answer dialogue at the end of the song. It was thought best for the announcements to be in Maori (even though this necessitated later translation) since performers were naturally most fluent and most at home in their own language. Had they been required to announce the songs in English less information might have been obtained. In addition, the impromptu speech about the song at the beginning of the performance puts the performers at ease - since it is very much in the usual tradition - and enables the investigator to be as unobtrusive as possible. Too many questions can upset the performers.</field><field name="date">1958</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">music</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070622.141953</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The attitudes of European New Zealanders to native policy in the year 1859 : with particular reference to the question of divided responsibility</field><field name="creator">Williams, Alison Margaret</field><field name="description">Summary: It is the object of this essay to present a survey of public opinion respecting native policy in the year prior to the outbreak of the first Taranaki war. As European New Zealanders were in 1859 experiencing their third year of Responsible Government, the tone of public opinion is of particular interest, for theoretically the widely enfranchised public had it in their power to influence official policy by their votes. Although the field of Responsible Government did not, in theory, extend to Native Affairs, in practice this limitation was by no means absolute. Gore Browne&#65533;s power of ultimate decision was considerably modified by his avowed ignorance of Maori language, character, and customs; and by his dependence on the representative Assembly for funds to execute a positive native policy. He thus relied heavily on the Staff of the Native Department to supply his former deficiency; and agreed to allow a responsible minister to advise him on Native Affairs. This system in practice prevented the formulation and execution of a positive native policy, and involved a dangerous opportunity for irresponsible action. The equivocal nature of responsibility for native affairs was also a handicap to the development of public opinion, which was unable to concentrate on a supreme source of effective authority. For these reasons, the essay will contain particular reference to the question of divided responsibility.</field><field name="date">1958</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">Pakeha</field><field name="subject">politics</field><field name="subject">government relations</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070622.143409</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The influence of early church leaders and missionaries on Maori-Pakeha relations and constitutional development, 1839-1848</field><field name="creator">Brownlie, Carol</field><field name="description">The Maori and the Missionary before 1840.
	At the time of the British annexation of New Zealand, there existed no optimistic section of opinion in Britain as to the effect of European colonization on aboriginal races. Experience had showed that colonization of areas of the globe occupied by native races inevitably brought the disintergration, and eventual extinction even, of the original barbarous inhabitants. Humanitarian sentiment was strong in England especially in the Colonial Office itself, and humanitarianism was not linked with enthusiasm to extend the British sphere to lands already occupied by the coloured. Missionary activity in such areas was favoured by the authorities, - there was no opposition to any plan to civilize the pagan, but there was no desire to assume official responsibility for such activities.
	It has never been disputed that the assumption of sovereignty in New Zealand was forced upon the British Government by the precipitate actions of the New Zealand Company, and that the Colonial Office would have been content to allow the missionaries to continue with their task undisturbed. But when annexation became inevitable, the missionary activities in the country were taken into account; the Imperial Government accepted responsibility with the intention of protecting the natives from the designs of Europeans. This fact was to bear important results for the future of the aboriginal inhabitants of New Zealand. It has been maintained that the Maori race was in itself sufficiently aggressive and proud to have withstood the inevitable process of decay and extinction when faced by the European colonization of its country. Whether this would have been so or not, was not to be tested, but certainly there was no precedent set for such a romantic view. The Maori was to vindicate himself and to maintain his position in spite of the white flood that flowed in upon him in overwhelming numbers. That this was so was largely due not to maintain his place as a force to be reckoned with, but to the missionaries in his midst, who had prepared him for the adjustment to the Pakeha system, and who remained the protectors of his rights after British colonization was established.</field><field name="date">1957</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Missionaries</field><field name="subject">church history</field><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">christianity</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070622.143930</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ratana : the history of the origins, growth and nature of the Ratana movement, with reference to the adjustment of the Maori people to their changing social environment in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, some effects of the movement and the character of T.W.

The communal Maori was deprived, during the nineteenth century, of his tribal structure, his lands, his religious faith and his mana or self-respect. This occurred in four stages: acceptance of a new faith and new techniques, distrust and war, desperation which produced a series of rectionary cults, and finally apathetic resignation to eventual extinction of the race.
	From the degenerate Maori situation at the turn of the century there grew &#65533;the Maori renaissance&#65533; which was prepared for by the ideas of the educated leaders, created by a general social movement and effected by means of legislation which was demanded by the morehu or common people. The latter did not follow the educated leaders but were given a channel of expression in the Ratana movement which was an important factor in the Maori revival.</field><field name="date">1956</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">Tahupotiki Wiremu Ratana</field><field name="subject">Ratana Church</field><field name="subject">religion</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070622.144515</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A history of the Canterbury Maoris (Ngaitahu) with special reference to the land question</field><field name="creator">Evison, Harry</field><field name="description">Summary: 	 When Captain Cook skirted the coastline of Canterbury in 1770, the bleak and ill-defined shores which he could make out to westward, between squalls, appeared to offer little attraction for human habitation. Cook&#65533;s first impression seems to have had a retarding influence on European interest in Canterbury, until the pursuit of the whale brought other shipping to those waters.
	But Cook&#65533;s impression was for once misleading; for Canterbury was at this time inhabited by the tribe of Ngaitahu (1), whose numbers have been estimated variously at from two to ten thousand (2). With their headquarters at Kaiapoi (3), a pa famous alike for the strength of its defences, the wealth of its inhabitants, and the aristocratic bearing of its chiefs, the Ngaitahu were the undisputed masters of the whole island, from the Clarence river southwards.</field><field name="date">1952</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Ngai Tahu</field><field name="subject">Kia Tahu</field><field name="subject">history</field><field name="subject">Canterbury</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070625.093601</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A history of New Zealand anthropology during the nineteenth century</field><field name="creator">Booth, John March</field><field name="description">Summary: 	 "The ignorance which, generally speaking, prevails regarding the true character of the aboriginal population is not wonderful, simply because we know that there is no other branch of knowledge of which men are so thoroughly ignorant as the study of man himself. the constitution of man, mental as well as bodily, forms as yet no part of the ordinary course of education; and men are sent forth into the world to meet, deal, and to treat with one another, in total ignorance of each other&#65533;s character. it is not, under such circumstances, to be wonderer at, that, even in civilized life, disputes, quarrels, and troubles should exist; how much less so when the two extremes, the savage and the civilized, are brought into contact with one another."(1)
	With these words Dr. Martin, in 1845, outlined the need for special training for those who had to deal with native races, whether as missionaries, administrators, or merely as settlers amongst them. All those who came into contact with the Maoris had, of necessity, to study their ways to a certain extent, and some naturally, were more proficient in this than were their fellows. Wherever there was one who, through his understanding of the native character and the strength of his influence, was able to guide both Maori and Pakeha in their relations with one another, there the two peoples lived in peace. Dissension arose through the ignorance of either party of laws of the other, or because those laws were deliberately flouted. Training in the study of man, as suggested by Martin, would have dispelled this ignorance and inculcated a spirit of tolerance which could have eased much of the friction that ensued. Where it was essential to compromise on conflicting points, or where the weaker of the two parties was forced to conform to the ways of the other, then again this training would have indicated the best procedure to be adopted. But no system of schooling at that time included a study of anything like anthropology, which was then an unthought-of science, and the only hope of harmonious race relations lay in the possibility that certain of those in responsible positions amongst both Europeans and Maoris would have enough wit to discern the right course--Introduction.</field><field name="date">1949</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Anthropology</field><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">Pakeha</field><field name="subject">ethnology</field><field name="subject">material culture</field><field name="subject">social organization</field><field name="subject">origins</field><field name="subject">prehistory</field><field name="subject">missionaries</field><field name="subject">settlers</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070625.095251</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A proximate analysis of a Maori food; the Karaka berry.</field><field name="creator">McCurdy, Betty Joan</field><field name="description">Summary: 	 Although the study of nutrition during the last forty years has received considerable attention, there are still fields of the science about which our knowledge is very incomplete.

	It is well known that the figures, even for carbohydrate, protein and fat, compiled by workers in different parts of the world, vary widely. In accurate work it would therefore be incorrect to use such figures which were compiled in another country.

Preliminary surveys of population-movements do, in fact, appear in the introduction to a number of recent books on primitive peoples. But only one such survey of any New Zealand area has yet appeared - Miss E. Durward&#65533;s paper on the Maori population of Otago. (1) How completely the need for accurate estimates of Maori population has been lost sight of its demonstrated by the appearance in August 1940, and of The Maori of To-day, edited by Professor I. L.

E. S. (Marjorie Edith Stuart)</field><field name="description">Summary: 	 In order that one may approach the main theme of this thesis, the massacre at Poverty Bay, the events leading there to, and the effects thereof, some slight knowledge is required of the general situation in New Zealand in the years immediately preceding. The writer considers that no apology is needed for introducing into a work that has for its title "The Poverty Bay Massacre of 1868", such apparently unrelated topics as the campaigns of 1845 to 1868 and the cult of Pai-Marire.
	In any historical review, cause and effect are so closely related that it is difficult, when choosing a particular field of research, to decide how much to include and, more important, how much to discard. The Maori Wars in the Waikato and Taranaki districts spread through the whole of the North Island and in time to the East Coast. Here they were intensified by the blend of Christianity and savage barbarity that is known as Pai-Marire or Hauhauism. It was during this campaign on the Coast that Te Kooti Rikirangi first came into political prominence.
	A study of Hauhauism is interesting in itself; reviewed in connection with the central figure of this thesis, Te Kooti, it acquires new significance. It is doubtful how far he was sincere in the religious ritual he instituted, itself a modification, and an adaptation of the old Pai-Marire cult, but out of it he fashioned a powerful weapon against the Pakeha. Perhaps it deserves a place as a psychological study of the influence of community worship in a mysterious and militant ritual upon the religious emotionalism of any sect and when, as here, that sect was composed of semi-civilised or wholly savage Maoris at a critical period in the history of their race, it was inevitable that it should issue in action.
	This thesis represents an attempt at more than merely collecting loose threads about the massacre into one narrative.
	It has been the writer&#65533;s aim to place the massacre in its right setting in the history of New Zealand, and thus to show its significance. The method chosen has been that of grouping the events round one central figure, that of the perpetrator of the massacre, and the first four chapters therefore are incidental though necessary. The history of this man continues long after 1868, the date of the massacre and a small section has been added to cover the period 1868 to 1893, the year of his death on the plea that though irrelevant to the subject of the thesis it gives a rounded effect that might otherwise be lacking--Introduction.</field><field name="date">1935</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">Pai-Marire</field><field name="subject">Hau-hau</field><field name="subject">history</field><field name="subject">land wars</field><field name="subject">Te Kooti Rikirangi</field><field name="subject">East Coast</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070625.110754</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Te Puoho and his South Island raid : or, from Taranaki to Tuturau.</field><field name="creator">Ross, Angus</field><field name="description">Summary: 	 In European judgment the Maoris of New Zealand are the finest of the Polynesians. The intelligence, courage and dignity of the Maori leaders have won the admiration of those who have met them in council or in the field. Their virtues have been extolled by able writers in the past and if to-day the average Maori appears to have fallen from the high standard set by an earlier generation, then that is all the more reason for turning back a hundred years to the days when the Maoris lived and fought as they pleased, when a chief was a chief, and a toa (warrior) played the part expected of him.
	New Zealand history does not go back so far that we can afford to pass over the Maori part of it. This is especially true of that section which refers to the period immediately preceding definite European settlement. Modern man is keenly interested in the past and research is being made into the histories of all races.

It is a fact that the Maori population in any given locality was a fluctuating one and that their distribution in general was very variable and this constitutes a formidable difficulty in making any estimate of their numbers before the first cenus. A second obstacle is the difficulty of travel which faced the early European explorers. For example, when Cook visited New Zealand, he made an estimate of the population but it was largely conjectural as Cook saw the natives at only those places he touched around the coast, and had in fact no means of estimating what proportion of the total population those communities formed. Actually the Maoris were not confined to the coastline, and therefore Cook&#65533;s estimate cannot be regarded as based on adequate data.

No one who walks the beach at the present time would realise that this was the scene of a seige during the Maori Wars in the South Island, or that the beach and the banks of the Merton River was the site of a whaling station from 1835 to 1845. What is now called Waikouaiti is not the Waikouaiti of early days, which was the name given to the whaling station at the mouth of the Waikouaiti River. The name of the river has also been changed to the Merton River.
	The word Waikouaiti has been spelt in various ways. Some maintain it should be Wai-kau-iti (water become little) or Wai-ko-wai-iti (water, the end of the little stream). Tamati Parata, an old chief at Puketeraki, near Waikouaiti considers that Waikouaiti (properly Waikowai-iti) means the end (Ko) of the water or stream (wai iti running into water or sea (wai).
	The name Merton is now given to this locality at the mouth of the little stream, now the Merton River.
	The present spelling Waikouaiti was fixed in 1843, but before that date it was spelt Whikowhiti, Whykowite, Waikoaite, Whykowat, Waikooti, Waikowaiti, and Whycauity.</field><field name="date">1927</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">Otago</field><field name="subject">South Island</field><field name="subject">history</field><field name="subject">Waikouaiti</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070625.124936</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Medicine amongst the Maoris in ancient and modern times.</field><field name="creator">Buck, Peter Henry (Te Rangi Hiroa)</field><field name="description">Summary: 	 My excuse for attempting this thesis is firstly, that I am a graduate in medicine of the University of New Zealand and secondly, that my mother was a Maori.
	It seems to me that with a young university such as that of New Zealand, without the facilities for research work provided by older and richer homes of learning, the scope for original work, which it is the duty of every University to encourage and foster, is somewhat limited. In the philology, history and ethnology of the Polynesian Race, however, is provided a wide field for research work which it is the bounden duty of this University to explore and lead the way. As an obligation to my &#65533;alma mater&#65533; I take up the subject nearest to my family - medicine amongst the Maoris, in ancient and modern times.
	As another reason, I have the honour through my mother of belonging to the Maori race. As a result of four years work amongst them as an officer of Health, I am much struck by the different view-point with which the two races, European and Maori, approach the subject of disease. As a member of the Race I am perhaps enabled to understand my mother&#65533;s people more intimately than the more progressive but some what forgetful Anglo-Saxon. My experience of Maori ideas and customs dates from beyond the time of graduation in medicine. In childhood&#65533;s days, I experienced the bitter taste of the decoction prepared from phorium tenex and I heard around me the whispered diagnosis of &#65533;makutu&#65533; and &#65533;mate Maori&#65533;. Constantly throughout youth and early manhood, I have seen the European doctor wax impatient with what he terms prejudices or superstitions which retard or prevent the recovery of Maori patients. I have understood and sympathised with him. At the same time, with the priveledge of the half-breed inheriting the blood and ideas of both races I have been able to detach myself from European thought and look at the question of disease from my Maori countryman&#65533;s viewpoint. I understood the burden of the neolithic man&#65533;s fears and I symathise with him more deeply still. There are deep holes in the Urenui river which flows through our tribal territory wherein, so my Maori mother taught me, dwelt &#65533;taniwhas&#65533; or &#65533;dragons of slime&#65533; who destroyed the transgressor of the multitude of Maori laws and observances. Years of College and University education, combined with the unbelief inherited from a European father, have not been able to suppress the involuntary shudder and contraction of the erector pilae which the suggestion of bathing in those dark holes gives rise to. We inherit our fears in our blood, we imbibe them at our mother&#65533;s breast. The schools and teaching of a father appeal to us as we grow older. We subject customs and faiths to the light of comparative criticism and we ridicule the ideas of more primitive races as absurd. But in times of stress, despondency and lowered vitality, there is a tendency to revert to the mother&#65533;s fears which slumber within beneath the veneer of civilisation. How much more so in the case of the full Maori who has not had the advantage of even primary education! Clodd says, "In structure and inherited tendencies each of us is recent". The Maori has not been civilised for a century yet. As a duty to my kin, I have attempted to put on record their view of disease, in the hope that though anthropologist&#65533;s and others have done so much in collecting the ideas and customs of races on a lower culture stage, this thesis may serve as a small contribution to ethnology.</field><field name="date">1910</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">medicine</field><field name="subject">health</field><field name="subject">hauora</field><field name="subject">ethnography</field><field name="subject">history</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070625.130005</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The economic life of the present-day Maori.</field><field name="creator">Jansen, Elwyn George</field><field name="description">Summary: 	 In order to gather material and to fit himself generally for the writing of this thesis, the writer, in company with a companion, devoted a portion of the Summer Vacation to an extended tour of the Maori field. Time did not permit of a visit to the North Auckland Peninsula, but with this exception, a complete circuit of the North Island was made. Visits to different parts of the South Island field had been made at an earlier date and had brought forth valuable experience in methods of approach and in the kind of enquiries that should be pursued. Letters of introduction were secured from Officials of the Native Department in Wellington, and from other Maori leaders, to prominent local personalities at different points in the journey. Under the sponsoring of such local leaders, avenues of enquiry were opened up that would otherwise have been closed. Care was taken, however, not to see only those things to which the leaders directed our attention. We travelled by car and carried camping equipment, so that it was possible to pause where inclination prompted. Many nooks and corners were thereby investigated. Living conditions, attempts at farming, the lately-instituted Land-development Schemes, and the Maori at work and at play, were all seen at first hand. Such observations were supplemented by interviews and casual conversations with scores of people, both Maori and European, in all walks of life:- Officials of Maori Land Boards, County Clerks, School Teachers, Medical men, Clergymen, Lawyers, Policemen, Storekeepers, Hotel Proprietors, Picture Theatre Managers of Dairy Factories, Farmers of all grades, labourers, tramps and many other such. From the wealth of material gathered, selection and elimination, for the purpose of keeping the thesis within reasonable bounds, have been difficult processes. The principle adopted has been to include such material as was calculated to give the most representative presentation of the whole Maori field.
	The tour has been valuable more in the way it has brought an appreciation of general trends than in the provision of exact information. Exact quantitative material has been gleaned largely from other sources - mostly from official publications and from direct correspondence with Government Departments. The contribution of the tour lies in the way it has illuminated all subsequent reading on the subject and in the way it has provided both general conclusions for enunciation and concrete examples with which to back them up.</field><field name="date">1935</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">economics</field><field name="subject">history</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070626.103516</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A history of the Maniototo.</field><field name="creator">Angus, Janet C</field><field name="description">Summary: 	 Maniototo, one of the fourteen counties of Otago, gained its name from the Maniototo Plain which makes up the greater part of the County. Mr W.H. Sherwood Roberts believes that the spelling of Manioto is not correct. "Toto" means blood, but the dictionaries do not give "manio". Instead "mania" means plain and the name should therefore be spelt Mania-o-toto, Plain of Blood, or simply Maniatoto. One old Maori told His Honour Mr. Justice Chapman that Maniatoto was the name of the Serpentine valley and that the plain was O Tu Rehua. When the name of Rough Ridge railway station was changed in 1908 to Oturehua, the explanation given was that a battle had been fought there in some distant period, the name of the victorious greenstone club Oturehua. The name, however, may mean the last resting place of Rehua, one of the most powerful of ancient Maori deities. On being questioned in 1890 by Mr. McPherson, M.P., Maori members of Parliament said that Oturehua is a very suitable substitution for Rough Ridge, for it means, in Old Maori, [sic]" a noble rugged eminence, worthy of being the standing place from which the commands of the great god Rehua might be given". It would appear that this poetic explanation must be the accepted one. Similarly the legend of the battle of ancient times must be the origin of the name Maniatoto, or Maniototo. Both spellings occur in official and unofficial reports from earlist times until 1877, when the county was instituted and the spelling fixed.</field><field name="date">1946</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">History</field><field name="subject">Maniototo</field><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">Pakeha</field><field name="subject">settlers</field><field name="subject">South Lsland</field><field name="subject">Kai Tahu</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070626.104340</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A compositional approach to understanding the formation of basal ice in the Antartic glaciers</field><field name="creator">Mager, Sarah M.</field><field name="description">The composition of ice from four case studies based on the facies, solute, stable isotope, and debris content reveals compositional differences reflective of different modes of ice formation. In Southern McMurdo Sound, there is a distinctive geochemical signature that differentiates between meteoric-origin and marine-origin ice. Analysis of the basal ice of three glaciers from the McMurdo Dry Valleys shows that liquid water does contribute to its formation. The basal ice sequences are structurally and compositionally different and are reflective of different modes of formation or entrainment active at the glacier margins. In the cases of the Rhone and Wright Lower glaciers marginal sediments and liquid water are key to understanding the accretion of debris-rich ice and both have basal facies consistent with refreezing in subzero conditions. The liquid water is formed by ephemeral melt during the summer. In the Rhone Glacier, melt water refreezes on the apron and is entrained into the advancing glacier. By contrast, by the Wright Lower Glacier adjacent streams or ponds saturate unconsolidated sediments which are entrained during ice advance. In the Taylor Glacier, the basal ice is comprised of a thick sequence of intercalated layers of clean clear ice and fine-grained debris layers. These laminated facies have a solute composition consistent with evaporites formed from a relict seawater intrusion. The combination of entrained debris, high solutes and laminations is consistent with interaction at the glacier bed and regelation. Interpreting empirically derived co-isotopic slopes is problematic, as highlighted in the case study of the Taylor Glacier where laminated facies have all the hallmarks of refrozen ice, yet plot on a co-isotopic slope that is typically interpreted as meteoric. Similarly, ice from the McMurdo Ice Shelf shows a clear difference in absolute isotope values which is interpreted as being refrozen from seawater, yet its co-isotopic plot is statistically indistinguishable from the meteoric water line. The ice compositional approach has highlighted several shortcomings. Firstly, solutes deposited in inland areas have limited solute pathways and do not distinguish between different types of ice but are useful in distinguishing between marine and continental salts. Secondly, co-isotopic analysis to reconstruct freezing history is dependent on statistically-derived interpretations which do not explain slopes that lie between physically-based models of meteoric and freezing slopes. In empirical studies, slopes between 5 and 8 are common, and are probably cosmopolitan samples. Finally, ice composition is inconsistent between similar ice types in the McMurdo Dry Valleys, as similar facies have different ice compositions, and origins. This underlines the problem with the premise that structurally similar ice facies are formed by the same process.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">glaciers</field><field name="subject">ice</field><field name="subject">Antarctica</field><field name="subject">McMurdo Dry Valleys</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20061129.150045</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Precipitation variability in the South Island of New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Mojzisek, Jan</field><field name="description">Precipitation is one of the atmospheric variables that characterize the climate of a region. The South Island of New Zealand (SI of NZ) has an unusually large number of distinct regional climates and its climatic diversity includes the coldest, wettest, driest and windiest places in New Zealand. This thesis focuses on identifying precipitation trends and rainfall fluctuations for the SI of NZ. 
 First, homogeneity of 184 precipitation series is assessed with the combination of three homogeneity tests (Standard Normal Homogeneity Test, Easterling &amp; Peterson test, Vincent&#65533;s Multiple Linear Regression). More than 60% of tested time series are found to contain at least one inhomogeneity. About 50% of the inhomogeneities can be traced to information in the station history files with nearly 25% of all inhomogeneities caused by the relocation of the precipitation gauge. 
 Five coherent precipitation regions are defined by the Principal Component Analysis. The objective of identifying the periods of water deficit and surplus in spatial and temporal domains is achieved by using Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI). The SPI series (for 3, 6, 12, 24 and 48 months time scales) are calculated for each region and used for analysis of dry and wet periods. Clear differences in the frequency, length and intensity of droughts and wet periods were found between individual regions. There is a positive (i.e. increase in wet periods) trend in SPI time series for the North, Westland and Southland regions during the 1921-2003 period at all times scales, and a negative trend for Canterbury during the same period. The results show longer wet periods than dry periods at all time scales. 
 Extreme heavy precipitation, which causes floods, is the most common type of natural disaster accounting for about 40% of all natural disasters worldwide. A set of ten extreme indices is calculated for 51 stations throughout the South Island for the period 1951-2003. The west-east division is found to be the dominant feature of extreme precipitation trends for all extreme indices with more frequent and more intense extreme precipitation in the west/southwest and with a declining trend in the east. The significant decrease in extreme precipitation frequency was detected in Canterbury with 3 days less of precipitation above the long-term 95th percentile by 2003 as compared to 1951. 
 The variability of precipitation, expressed by the SPI, is correlated with local New Zealand atmospheric circulation indices and large-scale teleconnections. The precipitation variability in the South Island is governed largely by the local circulation characteristics, mainly the strength and position of the westerly flow. The increase in precipitation in the West and SouthEast is associated with enhanced westerlies. The correlations between New Zealand&#65533;s circulation indices and regional SPI are seasonally robust. The SouthEast region exhibits a strong relationship with the Southern Oscillation Index on seasonal and annual time scales,and with Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation at the decadal scale. The predictability of seasonal precipitation one season ahead is very limited.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">precipitation variability</field><field name="subject">precipitation (meteorology)</field><field name="subject">precipitation forecasting</field><field name="subject">observations</field><field name="subject">measurement</field><field name="subject">climate</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">South Island</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070503.151144</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Prehistoric man and his environment in the Catlins, New Zealand.</field><field name="creator">Hamel, Gillian Eileen Mary</field><field name="description">Summary: 	 This thesis is a regional study of the interactions between Polynesian man and his environment in the Catlins district, southern New Zealand. The prehistory of the Catlins differs from that of the rest of southern New Zealand (Murihiku) in its pattern of early and continuing settlement followed by abandonment at the end of the seventeenth century. The examination of such a marked change in settlement pattern is likely to yield useful insights into the interplay of cultural and environmental factors.
	Three different approaches have been stressed: culture history, environmental characteristics and temporal changes in the environment. The relevant environmental factors were studied after consideration of the archaeological and ethnographic data. Methods of sampling and recording these factors were examined and the need to distinguish between man-induced and natural changes in the vegetation emphasised.
	This thesis incorporates newly gathered data on local climates, forest associations, forest clearings, estuarine populations and site location in the Catlins region, as well as on stratigraphical associations at Papatowai Point.
	Detailed analyses of the above disclosed that the initial economic pattern of Polynesian people in the Catlins was one of multi-resource zone exploitation of sea, estuary, soft and rocky shorelines, forests and inland plains. Early use of the Mataura and Waimea Plains may have been largely for exploiting silcrete and porcellanite sources, rather than for food supplies. It is postulates that when the climate deteriorated, sites adjacent to fewer resource zones were occupied. The earlier sites may have been abondoned, or occupied at the same time. Two settlement models, incorporating these alternatives, are presented. Seasonal markers indicate a maximum occupation from spring to autumn, and there is no positive evidence of winter occupation. About 1700-1750 A.D., the Catlins coast was abandoned, despite the continued availability of most traditional food supplies. Moas has become extinct and, judging by the data from Papatowai, seals were less abundant than in the 11th to 14th centuries.
	Ethnographic material indicates that the inland resources of eels, lampreys, forest birds and, presumably, bracken rhizomes were important in the 19th century to Maoris living immediately north and south-west of the Catlins. It is postulated that the local peoples ceased using the Catlins coast in the early 18th century because the dense forests made access to the inland regions difficult. With the moas extinct and seal colonies locally depleted, the Catlins coast lost much of its advantages. A new strategy was adopted of spending the summer months at the mouth of the Clutha River or west of Waikawa where the same resources could be exploited as on the Catlins coast but where inland access was easier. The Catlins coast may never have been occupied during winter, since the damp climate would militate against the storage of dried foods. Hence there is no need to assume a total shift of population in the 18th century to the north or west but rather a change in the pattern of seasonal movements.</field><field name="date">1977</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">history</field><field name="subject">anthropology</field><field name="subject">archaeology</field><field name="subject">South Island</field><field name="subject">Te Waipounamu</field><field name="subject">Kai Tahu</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070627.101419</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Aspects of &#65533;That great and glorious imprudence&#65533; C.W.

This is as it should be, because that event was a watershed - albeit an unhappy one - in the settlement in this country. I therefore make no apology for adding another piece of research which includes a consideration of events in 1859 and 1860.
	I first &#65533;discovered&#65533; C.W. Richmond when asked to present a tutorial on him whilst engaged in post-graduate studies at the University of Otago. Regular histories of the period of the Anglo-Maori Wars were consulted, but they dealt with Richmond only in passing. It was at this point that G.H. Scholefield&#65533;s two volume edition of the Richmond-Atkinson family papers came to my attention and I discovered in them a wealth of information hitherto unrevealed about the Minister for Native Affairs. Accordingly, I was attracted to a study of the man, and the present paper is the result. The wonder is that so little has been written on a man who played a key role (one could argue the key role) in the Waitara dispute which led the Anglo-Maori Wars. One thesis was written on him in 1948, and W.D.

	Maori had developed a complex set of burial rituals by the beginning of the nineteenth century, practised within the framework of tangihanga. These included primary and secondary burial and limited memorialisation, with practices varying between iwi. Change and continuity characterised the development of Maori burial practices and materials, translated traditional practices into new materials, and new practices into traditional materials. Although urupa came to appear more European, they were still firmly embedded in the framework of tangihanga and notions of tapu.
	The nineteenth century settlement of New Zealand occurred at a time of transition in British burial practices, with the traditional churchyard burial ground giving way to the modern cemetery. The predominantly British settlers transplanted both institutions to the colonial context. The cemeteries, churchyards and burial grounds created in nineteenth century New Zealand were influenced by a great number of factors. These included the materials available, the religious and ethnic make up of settler society, regionalism, economic ties, major events, political and social conditions, means of establishment and function.
	These processes, events, and influences resulted in a rich yet neglected material culture of urupa, cemeteries, churchyards, burial grounds and lone graves which are today valuable components of our historic and cultural landscapes. Portions of this heritage have already been lost through decay and destruction. Neglect is now the major threat. Part of this neglect is due to the fact that we do not understand our cemeteries, what they show, how and why they have developed over time.  Neglect is also engendered by cultural perceptions of what is valuable. While Maori regard urupa and burial places as toanga and sacred sites, Pakeha have tended to ignore their historic cemeteries. Such attitudes have been reflected and enforced by the policy of external agencies such as the New Zealand Historic Places Trust. New Zealand&#65533;s nineteenth century cemeteries have a great but under-utilised research potential, which it is important to recognise if we wish to preserve them.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cemeteries</field><field name="subject">history</field><field name="subject">death customes</field><field name="subject">tangihanga</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070627.111502</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cultural citizenship and the TVNZ charter : the possibility for multicultural representation in the commercial television environment.</field><field name="creator">Reid, Donald</field><field name="description">Summary: 	 Implemented in 2003, the TVNZ Charter is a one-page document that outlines the broadcaster&#65533;s objectives to deliver programming that represents New Zealand&#65533;s ethnically and socially diverse population.

	A Pakeha View
	I tell the story as I see it and people can read my material if they wish to but if they don&#65533;t then that is their problem. The trouble with New Zealanders is that they do not care about archaeology. The Maoris are the worst offenders. Their attitude is one of indifference, they couldn&#65533;t care less. When I have excavated on Maori land I have contacted the Maori organisations concerned and I have invited them to come along and observe what is being done because after all it is their history that I am digging up. However the decision is not really for the Maori to decide when I am working on Pakeha land, and anyway the land does not belong to the Maori, it belongs to all. I admit that I am sorry that archaeologists destroy sites but they do record them in their books.

To gain a true idea of the importance of native policy in the Session, one must know something of native affairs and how native problems had been dealt with previously. One must also know something of the characters and personalities of men dealing with this question, and what the public thought. There was considerable tension and conflict between the Governor and his ministers in native affairs, and it is interesting to speculate whether or not matters would have been improved had the Ministers been responsible for Native policy as they were in everything else; also, whether it was possible to avert the conflict between the Pakeha and native, or whether it was the inevitable result of two races with conflicting interests living in the same country.
	I have not attempted to deal at all with other matters which occupied the minds both of the settlers and the General Assembly, although some of these were of primary importance - for instance, a very fierce controversy was being waged between extreme Provincialism and extreme centralism. There was also the question of where the seat of Government should be, and other matters such as the Steam Ship Service. Also, each province was naturally interested in its own local matters - the "Nelson Examinerquot; was full of the gold fields, and the quot;Wellington Independentquot; was full of party strife. Naturally, the South Island was not very concerned with the native problem, although the different newspapers consistently reported on affairs in Taranaki and the Waikato. They were also content to let the North Island take the lead in the General Assembly in matters of native policy.</field><field name="date">1959</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">Pakeha</field><field name="subject">government</field><field name="subject">realtions</field><field name="subject">politics</field><field name="subject">policy</field><field name="subject">history</field><field name="subject">legislation</field><field name="subject">laws</field><field name="subject">Native affairs</field><field name="subject">indgenous peoples</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070627.135746</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Initialising neural networks with prior knowledge</field><field name="creator">Rountree, Nathan</field><field name="description">This thesis explores the relationship between two classification models: decision trees and multilayer perceptrons. 
 Decision trees carve up databases into box-shaped regions, and make predictions based on the majority class in each box. They are quick to build and relatively easy to interpret. Multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) are often more accurate than decision trees, because they are able to use soft, curved, arbitrarily oriented decision boundaries. Unfortunately MLPs typically require a great deal of effort to determine a good number and arrangement of neural units, and then require many passes through the database to determine a good set of connection weights. The cost of creating and training an MLP is thus hundreds of times greater than the cost of creating a decision tree, for perhaps only a small gain in accuracy. 
 The following scheme is proposed for reducing the computational cost of creating and training MLPs. First, build and prune a decision tree to generate prior knowledge of the database. Then, use that knowledge to determine the initial architecture and connection weights of an MLP. Finally, use a training algorithm to refine the knowledge now embedded in the MLP. This scheme has two potential advantages: a suitable neural network architecture is determined very quickly, and training should require far fewer passes through the data. 
 In this thesis, new algorithms for initialising MLPs from decision trees are developed. The algorithms require just one traversal of a decision tree, and produce four-layer MLPs with the same number of hidden units as there are nodes in the tree. The resulting MLPs can be shown to reach a state more accurate than the decision trees that initialised them, in fewer training epochs than a standard MLP. Employing this approach typically results in MLPs that are just as accurate as standard MLPs, and an order of magnitude cheaper to train.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">neural networks (computer science)</field><field name="subject">perceptrons</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070510.135442</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Assessment of the suitability of CFD for product design by analysing complex flows around a domestic oven</field><field name="creator">Fahey, Mark</field><field name="description">Competitive global markets are increasing the commercial pressure on manufacturing companies to develop better products in less time. To meet these demands, the appliance manufacturer, Fisher &amp; Paykel, has considered the use of computer simulation of fluid flows to assist in product design. This technology, known as Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), has the potential to provide rewarding insight into the behaviour of designs involving fluids. However, the investment in CFD is not without risk. This thesis investigates the use of CFD in oven design expressly to evaluate the numerical accuracy and suitability of CFD in the context of oven product development. 
 CFD was applied to four cases related to oven design, along with detailed experimental investigations, and resulted in a number of relevant findings. In a study of an impinging jet, the SST turbulence model was found to produce better results than the k-&#949; turbulence model. Measurements indicated that the flow was unsteady, but CFD struggled to reproduce this behaviour. The synergy between experimental and numerical techniques was highlighted in the simulation of a two-pane oven door, and resulted in temperatures on outer surface of the door predicted by CFD to within 2% of measured values. In the third study, a CFD simulation of a tangential fan failed to deliver acceptable steady-state results, however a transient simulation showed promise. The final case examined the flows through the door and cooling circuit of the Titan oven. Velocities predicted by CFD compared well against measurements in some regions, such as the potential core of the jet at the outlet vent, but other regions, such as entrained air, were poor. Temperatures were predicted to within an average of 2% of measured values. 
 It is found that limited accuracy does not necessarily prevent CFD from delivering engineering value to the product development process. The engineering value delivered by CFD is instead more likely to be limited by the abilities of the user. Incompatibilities between CFD and the product development process can reduce the potential value of CFD but the effects can be minimised by appropriate management action. The benefits of CFD are therefore found to be sufficient to merit its use in the product development process, provided its integration into the organisation is managed effectively and the tool is used with discernment. Recommendations for achieving this are provided.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">electric stoves</field><field name="subject">design</field><field name="subject">fluid dynamics</field><field name="subject">computer simulation</field><field name="subject">data processing</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070417.111809</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fashion and the artworld : intersection, interplay and collusion since 1982</field><field name="creator">Smith, Natalie D.</field><field name="description">Fashion scholarship has prospered since the 1980s. Yet in spite of the stimulating research in this field, principally in the domain of design, gender, media and cultural studies, only a handful of scholars have written about fashion&#65533;s relationship with the artworld. This, inspite of the artworld increasingly drawing upon the idiom of fashion - &#65533;the new&#65533;, &#65533;the now&#65533; and hype, and the evolvement of sartorial fashion into an exciting new artistic medium as the result of an increasingly experimental attitude towards design. This thesis considers the idiom of fashion as part of art-making, and how we might critically approach fashion design as a visual arts practice. 
 The relationship between fashion and the artworld is explored using the ideas of intersection, interplay and collusion. In utilising these ideas to explore the rapport between fashion and the artworld the multi-faceted nature of fashion&#65533;s relationship with the artworld, the slippages between the commercial and creative imperatives of fashion, are brought to the surface. 
 This project grew out of a &#65533;debate&#65533; emerging in the 1980s and 1990s and occurring in articles and exhibitions which sought to identify and elaborate on a closer rapport between fashion and art. Based on this &#65533;debate&#65533; six sites of connection are considered, beginning with a discussion on writing about fashion from a visual arts perspective, and where a range of proponents and proposals are considered. The thesis then shifts to an analysis of the February 1982 special issue of Artforum which featured a garment designed by Issey Miyake on its cover. This is followed by an exploration of the value attached to fashion in the artworld. The fashion designer&#65533;s self-construction as a visual artist is the subject of the next chapter, followed by a look at the emergence of Conceptual Couture - ideas-based fashion. The final chapter considers fashion in the exhibition environment.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">fashion and art</field><field name="subject">fashion in art</field><field name="subject">clothing and dress</field><field name="subject">fashion design</field><field name="subject">costume design</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070417.122533</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of post consumption narrative : an exploration of identity and 'cool'</field><field name="creator">Ferguson, Shelagh Wyn</field><field name="description">Consumers tell stories every day: stories about the products they buy, the experiences they consume, even their friends&#65533; and families&#65533; consumption experiences - in fact, stories about most aspects of their lives. People live &#65533;storied&#65533; lives. Consumption experiences are understood and related to others through stories (2003). These stories are loaded with personal, social and cultural meaning that varies significantly dependent upon the intended audience and effect (Bruner 1987) 
 Stories are everywhere and understanding these narratives in relation to consumer experience is a challenge that consumer research must embrace (Stern 1998b). The study of such narratives must address issues such as the content of the story, how it is told, who is actually doing the telling and for what purpose. All these stories exist in context. These contexts are not a means in themselves; rather, they are a means to understand a particular aspect of a consumer phenomenon. In this case, the research presented in this thesis seeks to understand the purpose and function of consumers&#65533; narratives about commercial adventure experiences. Hence the context of this research is commercial adventure experiences consumed in Queenstown, New Zealand, billed in promotional tourist literature as &#65533;the adventure capital of the world&#65533; (Smitz et al. 2004). This specific focus on commercial adventure therefore defines the sample group as consumers of commercial adventure experiences in Queenstown. Hence, the scope of this research is limited to understanding the phenomenon under investigation (consumer narratives) in relation to members of Generation Y, as they are the primary consumers of commercial adventure experiences in New Zealand. 
 This research adopts an interpretive, inductive approach utilising qualitative tools to frame and develop an evolving research question. The primary data collection has an initial framing of the research question phase and then three main phases utilising a variety of qualitative tools including observation, in-depth interviewing and videography. The research addressed many issues, including the preference of consumers to narrate these adventure consumption experiences to their most valued community, their home community, and how they intended to tell their stories to their home community when removed from that community. Additionally, consumers&#65533; perceptions of &#65533;cool&#65533; were investigated, together with the reactions they anticipated receiving from their audiences. This research investigated &#65533;cool&#65533; as a more meaningful term than status, used by the members of Generation Y to describe the most desired outcome for the narration of their consumption experiences. 
 Several key themes emerged from this research. They were the use of these consumer experience narratives in the identity-construction process, both collectively and individually, and how this related to the classic hero myth identity construction (Campbell 1972) and how &#65533;cool&#65533; was acquired by these consumers through their narrations. Implications of the findings are presented for consumer research with specific reference to a model of community formation based on consumption practices and Generation Y as a community sharing a consciousness of kind.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">consumer behavior</field><field name="subject">shopping</field><field name="subject">consumption (economics)</field><field name="subject">psychological aspects</field><field name="subject">Generation Y</field><field name="subject">consumers</field><field name="subject">identity (psychology)</field><field name="subject">popular culture</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070418.111413</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modern medicine and the Sherpa of Khumbu : exploring the histories of Khunde Hospital, Nepal 1966-1998</field><field name="creator">Heydon, Susan</field><field name="description">The celebrated Sherpas of Himalayan mountaineering, who lived in the rugged high-altitude environment of the Everest area of Nepal, lacked Western style medical services and so iconic New Zealander, Sir Edmund Hillary, 'hero' of Everest, built them a small hospital in 1966. He administered Khunde Hospital through the Himalayan Trust, but with substantial support, since the late-1970s, from the Sir Edmund Hillary Foundation in Canada. Overseas medical volunteers assisted by local staff provided a range of outpatient and inpatient, curative and preventive services. The history of Khunde Hospital, therefore, provides a case study for the introduction of modern medicine, as Sherpas referred to Western or biomedicine, and for the implementation of an overseas aid project. 
 In my analysis I have moved away from a binary, oppositional examination of a cross-cultural encounter and have situated Khunde Hospital in a conceptual device of 'worlds'. I argue that the hospital existed and operated simultaneously within multiple separate yet interconnected worlds, but do not privilege one discourse over another. These worlds work beyond culture, encompassing institutions, political structures and knowledge communities and were physical, social and intellectual spaces within which there were rules and norms of behaviour that structured action. 
 In order to explore the histories of Khunde Hospital I set it within four distinct but overlapping worlds: that of Sir Edmund Hillary, the Sherpa, Western medicine and international aid. These are worlds that I have identified as being important for the questions I am looking at. My central discussion is the ongoing encounter between Sherpa beliefs and practices about sickness and modern medicine, particularly looking at the individual patient&#65533;s use and non-use of the hospital and how staff there responded. The response was neither a one-way diffusion of Western medical practice, nor a collision between the spirit-suffused system of the Sherpa and scientific biomedicine. People used the hospital for some things but not others, based on their perception as to whether the hospital was the effective, appropriate option to take. Over the years, the hospital and community became used to each other in a relationship that was in practice a coexistence of difference. Each acknowledged and could incorporate aspects of the other&#65533;s beliefs and practices when dealing with a person&#65533;s sickness, but remained separate. 
 Using the conceptual device of worlds, however, suggests the need for this example of the introduction and spread of Western medicine to be grounded in a consideration of Hillary&#65533;s particular form of aid, the shifting discourse of international medical aid between the 1960s and the 1990s and the unique world of the Sherpa of Khumbu. All of these worlds influenced the provision of health care at and from Khunde Hospital in different ways, sometimes separately but often simultaneously, and at some times and for some issues more than others. People, place and relationships often had as much influence as - and sometimes more than - the medicine. If the key to understanding Khunde Hospital is the relationship between Sherpas and Hillary and the respect that began in a partnership on the mountains in the 1950s, then the multiple worlds of Khunde Hospital underscore the complexities of implementing Sherpa requests to build a hospital in their rugged home near the world&#65533;s highest mountain.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Khunde Hospital</field><field name="subject">Medicine</field><field name="subject">Nepal</field><field name="subject">Nepalese</field><field name="subject">Khumbu Valley</field><field name="subject">Sherpa</field><field name="subject">Sir Edmund Hillary</field><field name="subject">Customs</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070119.122329</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Referral source selection in word of mouth communication : findings from export education movements of China and Malaysia</field><field name="creator">Gray, Vaughan R.</field><field name="description">Research attention on word of mouth (WOM) communication is growing in necessity and popularity as recent studies continue to confirm that WOM has a significant effect on consumer and organisational decision-making and buying behaviour. Much of the theory generated from this field of communications research has been based on product purchase situations that take place in the United States. More recent developments in the stream of research have begun to address WOM in service contexts and also driven a need to test the reliability of previous works in other countries and cultures. 
 The research problem of this thesis emerged from such needs to further develop WOM theory and is defined by two key statements: (i) How does perceived source credibility and the content (message) of personal communication shape and determine the nature of a WOM system? (ii) What likely influence does culture have on a WOM system? 
 The WOM system conceptualised within this thesis refers to a network of actors in which, personal, verbal, face to face communication occurs. It also refers to the nature of the information exchanged and how these messages determine which actors within the system participate. Addressing the need for further research into service-based contexts, the industry of export education was identified as an ideal environment in which to investigate the problem. In particular, international students (current and potential) were interviewed and surveyed on how WOM is used to gather information to make a decision on where to study. 
 A predictive model of referral source selection is developed as the significant contribution to theory resulting from the qualitative and quantitative research employed in the methodology. The qualitative research was exploratory in nature and designed to understand the decision-making process international students went through before making a choice on their study destination. In depth interviews confirmed that WOM was used frequently throughout this process and identified the important pieces of information sought after by students and which sources the students consulted to obtain the information. International students are concerned about the international recognition of a university, teaching styles, tuition fees, graduate prospects and how compatible the lifestyle of the host country is for them amongst many issues. They consult a variety of personal sources including family, friends, alumni, university agents and even their school teachers. 
 The main quantitative study in this thesis surveyed 420 university students from China and Malaysia and was designed to provide theory verification for the WOM system and explore potential impacts of culture on this system. Firstly, four common WOM themes were identified from all of the content exchanged through WOM between students and their referral sources. These themes are grouped as; informational messages, comparative messages, personal perspectives and guidance messages. The WOM system was then depicted as a predictive model of referral source selection based on which WOM themes are exchanged between actors. 
 As consumers progress through a structured decision-making process, their information requirements (WOM themes) change and so do the sources selected to deliver the information. Secondly, important differences in WOM behaviour emerged between the Chinese and Malaysian samples. Although students from both countries are equally influenced by personal sources of communication, Malaysians considered alumni friends and parent/family sources to be more influential than the Chinese. Whereas the Chinese preferred talking with school teachers and close friends to help in their decisions. These findings added credible evidence of national culture effects to the predictive model of source selection. 
 The thesis concludes by addressing limitations in the research - largely, that the study failed to produce evidence of cultural value dimensions impacting on the WOM system. The Chinese cultural value framework employed was well justified as an appropriate measure however, there were no equivalent measurements of Malaysian cultural values and the study was conducted on a limited convenience sample, making results difficult to generalise through Chinese and Malaysian populations. Further research was then suggested to address these limitations.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">oral communication</field><field name="subject">education</field><field name="subject">foreign students</field><field name="subject">china</field><field name="subject">malaysia</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">college choices</field><field name="subject">consumers</field><field name="subject">preferences</field><field name="subject">mathematical models</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070501.120724</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Prevalence and regulation of the gene encoding Zoocin A</field><field name="creator">O'Rourke, Annalee D.</field><field name="description">Selected strains of Streptococcus equi subsp. zooepidemicus produce a bacteriocin-like inhibitory substance called zoocin A. Zoocin A has bacteriolytic activity against closely related species of streptococci, including the etiological agents of dental caries and Streptococcus pyogenes. Zoocin A functions to hydrolyse the peptidoglycan of bacterial cell walls. Producer-cell immunity to zoocin A is encoded by zif, the zoocin A immunity factor. The zooA-zif gene locus is chromosomally encoded and flanked by two transposon-like sequences with significant similarity to the lss-lif locus encoding lysostaphin in Staphylococcus simulans. This suggested the possibility that the zooA-zif locus was acquired by S. equi subsp. zooepidemicus through a horizontal gene transfer event. Studies conducted to examine this hypothesis were unable to establish the mechanism by which zooA-zif was acquired. Examination of 24 S. equi subsp. zooepidemicus strains using random amplified polymorphic DNA analysis and pulse field gel electrophoresis showed that the species was highly heterogeneous. Examination of the 24 strains using Southern hybridisation revealed only three S. equi subsp. zooepidemicus strains contained the zooA and zif genes; however the partial open reading frames (flaR and rgg-like) flanking zooA and zif appeared to be conserved in all tested strains. Long template PCR was used to examine this chromosomal area containing the zooA and zif genes in 24 S. equi subsp. zooepidemicus strains. These results, along with comparison of sequence data from two zoocin A producing strains, and analysis of the sequenced S. equi subsp. zooepidemicus H70 and S. equi subsp. equi 4047 genomes showed the area surrounding the zooA-zif locus to be one of considerable genetic variation substantiating the hypothesis that zooA-zif were acquired via horizontal gene transfer. 
 Studies on zoocin A production suggested that zooA expression was under carbon catabolite regulation, (CCR). In the Gram-positive bacteria CCR, is mediated by the carbon catabolite control protein (CcpA). CcpA is a DNA binding protein that can negatively regulate transcription of its target gene by binding to a catabolite-responsive element (CRE). This study reports the regulation of zif and zooA expression in response to cellular growth on different carbon sources, the presence of a ccpA-like gene in the genome of S. equi subsp. zooepidemicus, the presence of a CRE sequence in the promoter region of zooA, and the effect of a ccpA deletion on zooA expression. Zoocin A activity, zooA and zif mRNA transcript levels, and zooA and zif reporter gene activities were monitored during growth of S. equi subsp. zooepidemicus 4881 in a pH-controlled batch culture system. Zoocin A titres were maximal when the bacteria were grown on a starch-based medium and minimal when grown on a glucose-based medium. Northern hybridization showed that zif was constitutively expressed during growth regardless of the carbon source available. In contrast, zooA was transcribed at low levels in cells grown on a glucose-based medium but at much higher levels in cells grown on a starch-based medium. Use of a zooA promoter-chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) reporter demonstrated that zooA expression increased 17-fold in cells grown on a starch-based medium. Use of a zif promoter-CAT reporter showed that in cells grown on a starch-based medium zif was transcribed approximately 4 times as strongly as in cells grown on glucose. Transcription of zif was always much less than that of zooA. A ccpA deletion mutant appeared to exhibit complete de-repression of zooA under all growth conditions. Together these data showed that zoocin A expression was regulated in response to the carbon source on which the bacteria were grown.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">streptococcus</field><field name="subject">genetics</field><field name="subject">gene expression</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070501.162825</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effect of alcohol exposure in early gestation on brain development</field><field name="creator">Li, Yuhong</field><field name="description">Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD), caused by maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy, has been extensively studied in the human. Animal studies show that alcohol exposure during very early development may result in severe brain damage, often incompatible with a postnatal life. However, for surviving offspring it is unknown whether they suffer long term brain damage. The final assembly of the mature brain results from a controlled balance between proliferation of glial and neuronal precursors and programmed cell death. The overall aim of the current study was to use a physiologically relevant mouse model to assess the acute and long-term effects of binge alcohol exposure on the early embryo, to simulate human pregnancy at the third week of gestation when pregnancy may be undetected. 
 A number of paradigms were used to assess the acute dose-response effect, the blood alcohol concentration (BAC) profile and the extent of cell death following alcohol exposure on gestational day (G) 7.5. The exposure paradigms were single binge IG6.5, IG4.5, IP4.5, or an extended binge IG4.5+, IG3.0+. Two control groups were Con6.5 and Con4.5+. Acute cell death was determined using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL), activated caspase-3 staining, and transmission electron microscopy. Cell proliferation was investigated using S-phase immuno-labeling, bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) birthdating and immuno-detection (BrdU/anti-BrdU). The long-term effects were investigated at G18.5 and postnatal day (PN) 60. Unbiased stereological methods were used to assess the effect of ethanol exposure at G7.5 on neocortical volume, cell number and density of neurons, glial cells, and capillary cells at PN60. 
 The first principal finding of the present study was that binge ethanol exposure during gastrulation resulted in acute apoptotic cell death in the ectoderm of the mouse embryo. Cell death was dependent on both peak BAC and the duration of elevated BAC. Significant increased cell death (TUNEL labeling) was observed in groups IG6.5 (9.43 &#65533; 2.08%) and IG4.5+ (8.97 &#65533; 2.12%) compared with control groups Con6.5 (2.14 &#65533; 0.09%) and Con4.5+ (2.81 &#65533; 0.36%). There was no significant increased cell death in ethanol exposed groups IG4.5 (3.43 &#65533; 0.45%), IP4.5 (3.68 &#65533; 0.67%), or IG3.0+ (1.72 &#65533; 0.24%). TEM analysis revealed that cell death exhibited characteristics of the apoptotic pathway. 
 The second principal finding of the present study was that binge ethanol exposure during gastrulation resulted in acute arrested proliferation in the ectoderm of the mouse embryo. The S-phase proliferation was significantly decreased within the whole ectoderm in the ethanol exposed group IG6.5 (45.58 &#65533; 2.34%) compared with control group Con6.5 (62.08 &#65533; 3.11%). 
 The third principal finding of the present study was that binge ethanol exposure during gastrulation induced the long term effect of laminate disorganization in the neocortex. The incidence of abnormal lamination was 87.5% in IG6.5 compared with 16.7% in IG3.0+ and 14.3% in Con6.5. Although ethanol exposure increased embryonic reabsorption, decreased litter size, and increased abnormal offspring, neocortical volume, and the total number of neurons, glial cells, and capillary cells was not affected. The total number (10&#8310;) of neurons, glial cells, and endothelial cells respectively was 12.221 &#65533; 0.436, 4.865 &#65533; 0.167, and 2.874 &#65533; 0.234 in IG6.5; 11.987 &#65533; 0.416, 4.942 &#65533; 0.133, and 2.922 &#65533; 0.130 in IG3.0+; and 11.806 &#65533; 0.368, 5.166 &#65533; 0.267, and 3.284 &#65533; 0.217 in controls, at PN60. 
 These results provide important information pertinent to fetal outcome for those women who drink heavily in early pregnancy. The results also demonstrate the importance of the pattern of ethanol exposure and blood alcohol concentration in determining the magnitude of ethanol&#65533;s teratogenic impact. Ethanol exposure on G7.5 that resulted in a high transient BAC, induced disorganized neocortical lamination, indicative of a permanent structural change. This disruption may result in altered neocortical function and requires further investigation.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">fetal alcohol syndrome</field><field name="subject">fetus</field><field name="subject">chemicals</field><field name="subject">brain</field><field name="subject">growth</field><field name="subject">pregnancy</field><field name="subject">drugs</field><field name="subject">effect</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070502.100319</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Marine ecology of offshore and inshore foraging penguins : the Snares penguin Eudyptes robustus and Yellow-eyed penguin Megadyptes antipodes</field><field name="creator">Mattern, Thomas</field><field name="description">Seabirds have become adapted for foraging in an oceanic environment that can be highly dynamic. Oceanographic processes determine the spatial distribution of seabird prey, while seasonality often has a temporal influence on prey availability. In penguins, these factors are reflected in the different species&#65533; foraging strategies. Penguins can broadly be categorized as inshore foragers that live in subtropical to temperate regions and profit from a stable food supply throughout the year close to their breeding sites, and offshore foragers that breed in a pelagic environment at higher latitudes where oceanographic processes and seasonality create much more dynamic, temporally limited prey situations. In this light, offshore foragers can be expected to be much more flexible in their foraging behaviour so as to quickly respond to changes in a dynamic marine environment, while inshore foragers are more likely to exhibit predictable foraging patterns. I examined the foraging ecology of two New Zealand penguin species - the offshore foraging Snares penguin Eudyptes robustus and the inshore foraging Yellow-eyed penguin Megadyptes antipodes and how their foraging strategies reflect an adaptation to the marine environment they exploit. 
 Diet composition of breeding Snares penguins (incubation and early chick-guard) was determined using the water-offloading method. Before the chicks hatched, the penguins generally brought little food back from their long foraging trips. During chick-guard, the stomach contents comprised mainly of crustaceans (~55%), fish (~24%) and cephalopods (~21%). However, the presence at times of many fish otoliths and squid beaks suggests that the latter two prey classes may play an even more important role in the adults&#65533; diet than the simple percentages based on mass suggest. The penguins&#65533; nesting routines were strongly synchronised between the years and correlated with the onset of the spring planktonic bloom. Using GPS data loggers and dive recorders I found that during the incubation phase, male penguins that performed long (ca. 2 week) foraging trips exhibited a strong affinity to forage in the Subtropical Front some 200 km east of the Snares. At that stage (late mid-October) the front featured elevated chlorophyll a concentrations, a pattern that can be observed every year. Thus, it seems that the front represents a reliable and predictable source of food for the male penguins. After the males returned, the female penguins also performed long foraging trips (&lt;1 week) but never reached the front, primarily because they had to time their return to the hatching of their chicks. After the chicks had hatched, the female Snares penguins were the sole providers of food. At this stage, the penguins performed short foraging trips (1-3 days) and foraged halfway between the Snares and Stewart Island (ca. 70-90 km north of the Snares), where nutrient-rich coastal waters flow eastwards to form the Southland Current. The penguins concentrated their diving effort in these waters, underlining the importance of the warm coastal waters as a food source for breeding Snares penguins. However, diving behaviour between 2003 and 2004 differed with penguins searching for prey at greater depths in the latter year. This underlines the Snares penguins&#65533; behavioural flexibility in response to a changing marine environment. 
 The Yellow-eyed penguins as typical inshore foragers showed very consistent foraging patterns at all stages. GPS logger deployments on penguins at Oamaru revealed that the birds foraged almost exclusively at the seafloor and targeted specific areas that featured reefs or epibenthic communities. As a result, the penguins&#65533; at-sea movements appeared conservative and at times almost stereotypic. Nevertheless, a comparison of Yellow-eyed penguins breeding on the adjacent Codfish and Stewart islands revealed a degree of plasticity in the species&#65533; foraging behaviour. Birds from Codfish Island extended their foraging ranges considerably and switched from primarily bottom to mid-water foraging during the post-guard stage of breeding. It seems likely that this switch is a result of enhanced feeding conditions (e.g. increased prey abundance/quality) in an area further away from the island, but the time required to get there renders this strategy not viable when chicks are small and need to be guarded and fed on a daily basis. As such, the change of behaviour represents a traditional pattern rather than a dynamic response to a sudden change in the marine environment. In comparison, penguins from Stewart Island showed consistent foraging patterns during all stages of breeding. Given the high levels of chick starvation on Stewart Island, the lack of plasticity in foraging behaviour is surprising and might indicate that Yellow-eyed penguins find it difficult to react quickly to a sub-optimal food situation. 
 Overall, it seems that Yellow-eyed penguins show a specialisation for a consistent benthic environment and, thus, lack the behavioural flexibility apparent in Snares penguins, which find their food in a changing pelagic marine environment.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Eudyptes robustus</field><field name="subject">yellow-eyed penguin</field><field name="subject">food</field><field name="subject">behavior</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070502.150734</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Resilience and vulnerability in communities around Mt Taranaki</field><field name="creator">Finnis, Kristen Kay</field><field name="description">The aim of this thesis is to examine the resilience and vulnerability of Taranaki communities to volcanic hazards, and to propose a strategy to ensure the safety and longevity of Taranaki residents in the event of an eruption. 
 Mt Taranaki is a dormant volcano that is surrounded by a ring plain populated by over 100,000 people. The volcano has had an average eruptive cycle of 330 years, with the last eruption dated at ~1755 AD. Hazards include ash fall, lahars, debris avalanches and pyroclastic density currents. Inglewood, Stratford and Opunake are the largest population centres located in moderate to high hazard zones, and for this reason were chosen as the study communities. 
 Resilience is defined as the capacity to respond to a hazard event by physically and psychologically recovering, adapting to, or changing to similar or better conditions than those experienced before the event. Vulnerability is defined to be people&#65533;s incapacity to cope with a hazardous event as a result of their personal characteristics. A person&#65533;s vulnerability and resilience is influenced by demographic variables, socio-cognitive variables and preparedness. 
 Inglewood, Stratford and Opunake adults have good self-efficacy and action-coping use, fair risk perceptions, outcome expectancy and response efficacy, but poor understanding of event timing relative to eruption probability, critical awareness, preparedness and information-seeking intentions and preparedness levels. Preparedness is found to be influenced by residents&#65533; intentions to prepare, which in turn are influenced by critical awareness, action-coping and outcome expectancy. 
 Taranaki students have a fair awareness of hazard and knowledge of correct response behaviours to various hazards. Preparedness, in terms of preparedness measures undertaken, emergency plans made and emergency practices in place, is low. Students who have participated in hazard-education programmes have a better knowledge of response behaviours, lower levels of hazard-related fear, and reported higher level of preparedness. 
 Spatial analyses, carried out to determine the geographic distribution of at-risk groups within the study communities, showed that the areas most at-risk tend to be those with the highest population densities. The spatial analysis was not as beneficial as expected, due to small data sets, but did provide some results to be considered as a basis for further research. 
 Effective public education can be achieved when delivered to a set of guidelines, such as providing information regularly through multiple media and sources, ensuring consistent messages, targeting information to at-risk groups and monitoring programme effectiveness. Community capacity building projects decrease aspects of vulnerability and build resilience by working at a local scale and targeting at-risk groups. Psychological preparedness education helps citizens to mentally prepare for an event and should be a component of all projects. 
 The proposed strategy calls for (a) forming partnerships with relevant stakeholders to assist with public education, research, and funding, (b) further research into the characteristics of Taranaki communities and effective public education campaigns, (c) the development and implementation of a public education schedule and projects that build community capacity, and d) long-term planning, periodic revision of programmes and consistent public engagement.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Taranaki</field><field name="subject">Mount Egmont</field><field name="subject">volcanic</field><field name="subject">hazard</field><field name="subject">analysis</field><field name="subject">resilience</field><field name="subject">environment</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070503.100402</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Trends and variability of temperature extremes in Southern New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Brown, Paula</field><field name="description">The purpose of this research was to create the longest possible, homogeneous, historical daily temperature dataset for Southern New Zealand, analyse the changes in extreme temperatures and investigate atmospheric circulation patterns that contributed to these changes. Daily minimum and maximum temperature data for Southern New Zealand were captured from paper records and extended to include all available archival data from the region. This dataset was digitised and contains temperatures from 26 stations that began operation sometime in the period between 1852 and 1953. Stations include the Chatham and Campbell islands. Adjustments for inhomogeneities in the dataset were made using a frequency distribution matching method. Dunedin has a record dating from 1852, the longest in the Southern Hemisphere south of 40&#65533;S latitude. Reconstruction of a homogeneous record for Dunedin was made by taking into account site changes from contemporaneous modem data logger measurements and from an analysis of overlapping period data. Temperatures showed no clear pattern of change in Southern New Zealand from the mid 1800s through to the early 1900s with the exception of a brief cold period that occurred around 1900. However, from the 1940s through to the 1970s both minimum and maximum extreme temperatures showed strong warming. These trends were duplicated over the shorter length period of record for other regions, especially in Eastern Canterbury. The warming trend was maintained over the period 1979 - 2003, but only in the colder ends of minimum and maximum distributions. Temperatures have become less cold due to the recent compression of the temperature distribution. There was a marked decrease in cold days at stations in the south and offshore islands. Atmospheric circulation pattems, and in particular ENSO, were shown to affect extreme temperatures recorded in Southern New Zealand. Anomalous southwesterlies associated with El Nino events produce cooler temperatures and increase the numbers of cold extreme temperatures, while anomalous northeasterlies typical of La Nina increase the numbers of warm extreme temperatures. Monthly frequencies of extreme temperatures were primarily affected by anomalous south/north meridional airflows to increase cold/warm extreme temperature frequencies. Zonal airflows have a lesser, but topographically influenced effect. Record hot and cold temperatures in Southern New Zealand were a product of the interaction between advective northerly and southerly airflows respectively, and local climatic effects caused by topography.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">South Island</field><field name="subject">weather</field><field name="subject">meteorology</field><field name="subject">observations</field><field name="subject">climate</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070514.100400</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Towards a deeper understanding of the polymorphic conversion of carbamazepine in aqueous suspension</field><field name="creator">Tian, Fang</field><field name="description">Polymorphism can influence every aspect of the properties of a solid including the shelf life, dissolution rate, solubility, formulation properties and processing properties of a solid drug. A deeper understanding of polymorphism and related solid state properties would ensure an improved quality of the materials used throughout drug preparation, dosage form formulation and clinical trials. Therefore, determination of the existence of polymorphs and pseudopolymorphs, characterization of different solid state forms and their respective properties, and controlling the existing form in the resulting formulation all form part of a rapidly growing field within pharmaceutical research and industry. 
 Carbamazepine (CBZ) was the model drug used in this study. FT-Raman spectroscopy was chosen as a main investigative technique in this study to evaluate its potential in monitoring (pseudo)polymorphic conversions in aqueous suspensions in the absence or presence of various pharmaceutical excipients. Partial least squares analysis (PLS) was used for quantitative analysis of the spectral data. 
 Earlier it has been found that CBZ converts rapidly to the dihydrate (DH) when exposed to humidity or water, and this has been reported to be the main reason for the sometimes observed greatly decreased bioavailability of marketed CBZ tablets. In this study, the conversion kinetics of CBZ (forms I, II and III) to DH in aqueous suspension were found to be first order kinetics with an unconverted portion (R&#65533; [greater than or equal to] 0.95), where the crystal morphology appeared to play a more important role in its conversion kinetics than the polymorphic form. The influence of pharmaceutical excipients on the conversion of CBZ in aqueous suspension was also explored. For excipients such as methylcellulose (MC), hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) and hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC) which have both a low solubility parameter (&lt; 27.0 MPa[1/2]) and strong hydrogen bonding groups, complete inhibition of the conversion of CBZ was possible even at a very low concentration (0.1 % w/v). 
 Raman spectroscopy showed its high applicability in investigating CBZ conversion kinetics and screening of excipient effects in aqueous environment. It was demonstrated that Raman has a robust nature in quantitative analysis since problems such as different particle size, morphology, and spatial distribution of the two solid state forms of the drug seemed not to have significant influence on Raman scattering. 
 This study has also clarified the relative importance of many contributing factors (type of crystalline form (CBZ or DH), crystal morphology, surface area, and excipient interactions with drug particles) influencing the in vitro dissolution of CBZ. The solid state characterization approach taken in this study will provide a deeper insight into the dissolution performance of drugs and should thus lead to a better understanding of in vitro/in vivo behavior of drugs.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">carbamazepine</field><field name="subject">pharmacokinetics</field><field name="subject">chemistry</field><field name="subject">suspensions</field><field name="subject">polymorphism</field><field name="subject">crystallography</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070601.135438</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Involvement of p53 and Rad51 in adenovirus replication</field><field name="creator">Russell, Iain Alasdair</field><field name="description">As an Adenovirus infects a host cell a multitude of molecular interactions occur, some driven by the virus and some driven by the cell it is infecting. Many of these areas of Adenovirus biology have been intensely studied over the last half century, however, many questions remain unanswered. The aim of this study was to investigate, more closely, a long studied molecular interaction, namely the role of the tumour suppressor p53 in the Adenovirus life cycle, and also to investigate the related, but much less studied, interaction between Adenoviruses and the host cell DNA repair machinery. 
 Controversy surrounds the role of p53 in the Adenovirus life cycle, with current dogma favouring the view that p53 is inactivated, as it presumably presents an obstacle to a productive infection. In Chapter 3, a standardised infection protocol was developed to examine this area of Adenovirus biology more closely. This was followed with an array of cell viability and western blotting analyses that not only showed p53 was not an antagonist of the Adenovirus life cycle, but in some cases p53 acted as a protagonist. Isogenic cell lines were used to reinforce this point. Following this, data were provided that virus DNA replication was linked to the ability of an Adenovirus to kill cells. Furthermore, p53 was shown by immunofluorescence to be present in infected cells at a time that corresponded with virus DNA replication, albeit at low levels. By adding p53 back into cells, it was shown that the number of Adenovirus progeny could be stimulated to levels produced in genetically wild type TP53 cells. A selection of promoter/reporter assays and infection/transfection assays then showed how p53 might be aiding the virus life cycle. These data showed that low levels of p53 cooperated with the Adenovirus transactivator, E1A, to promote late gene expression, and this translated into a modest increase in virus late antigens in infected cells. Taken together these data show that, contrary to current dogma, p53 generally aids an Adenovirus infection and it may do this through promoting virus late gene expression. 
 Recent data have emerged suggesting Adenoviruses must disable the host DNA double-strand break machinery to achieve a productive infection. As this area of Adenovirus biology is in its infancy, and as p53 has recently been identified as an integral component of these DNA repair processes, the contributions of the host cell repair machinery to Adenovirus biology were examined in Chapters 4 and 5. In Chapter 4, western blotting showed that upon Adenovirus infection, a key component of the homologous recombination repair machinery, Rad51, was markedly up-regulated. This up-regulation occurred independently of other key repair proteins, and was found to be a generalised feature of an Adenovirus infection. Surprisingly, p53 did not appear to be involved in this up-regulation, and neither were several other nodal host regulatory proteins. The up-regulation was then linked to Adenovirus DNA replication using a temperature-sensitive mutant Adenovirus, ts125. In Chapter 5, functional analysis of this up-regulated protein showed that Rad51 colocalised with Adenovirus replication centres. This colocalisation coincided with a time when virus DNA replication was occurring. Furthermore, transient over-expression of Rad51 drastically increased the amount of virus progeny produced. This effect was reproduced in two very different cell types and with a selection of attenuated mutant viruses. Finally, several models were proposed that might account for this newfound effect of Rad51 on the Adenovirus life cycle. 
 The data presented in this thesis shows that Adenovirus not only interacts with key molecular machinery within the host cell, but also manipulates this machinery to its own end. These data add additional layers of complexity to current knowledge of the virus/host cell relationship, and thus reveal new avenues of research for future work.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">adenoviruses</field><field name="subject">DNA</field><field name="subject">DNA replication</field><field name="subject">p53 antioncogene</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070521.094929</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Supramolecular complexes of multimodal ligands</field><field name="creator">Black, Cory A.</field><field name="description">This thesis describes the synthesis and X-ray crystallographic analysis of a series of supramolecular architectures prepared using seven flexible multimodal ligands with Ag(I), Cu(I), Cd(II), Co(II), Ni(II) and Pd(II) metal salts. 
 Chapter one introduces some examples of fundamental supramolecular systems with particular focus on metallo-supramolecular motifs, specifically coordination polymers. Topological analysis is discussed as a method for the simplified description and comparison of network structures. 
 Chapter two describes the design, synthesis and characterisation of the symmetrical ligands bis(2-pyrazylmethyl)sulfide (psp), bis(4-pyrimidylmethyl)sulfide (msm) and 5,5&#65533;-(thiodimethylene)di-pyrazine-2-carboxylic acid methyl ester (csc) as well as the asymmetrical ligands 2-benzylsulfanylmethyl-pyrazine (psb), 2-pyridylsulfanylmethyl-pyrazine (psd), 3-pyridylsulfanylmethyl-pyrazine (psn) and 4-pyridylsulfanylmethyl-pyrazine (psy). 
 Chapter three presents a literature review of ligands related to psp, msm and csc, followed by the synthesis and characterization of thirteen Ag(I), Cd(II), Co(II), Ni(II) and Pd(II) complexes. The X-ray crystal structures of nine of these complexes are reported and compared. The structures were present as either one- or two-dimensional coordination polymers. The {[Ag(psp)](PF&#8326;)}[infinity] and {[Ag&#8322;(psp)(C&#8326;H&#8326;)(CH&#8323;CN)&#8322;](PF&#8326;)&#8322;&#65533;CH&#8323;CN}[infinity] structures demonstrated a solvent dependence by forming a 1-D twisted ladder with a [eta]&#65533;-bound benzene and a 2-D undulating sheet with a 4.8&#65533; topology respectively. Six of the structures {[Cd&#8322;(psp)(CH&#8323;CN)(H&#8322;O)(NO&#8323;)&#8324;]&#65533;H&#8322;O}[infinity], {[Co(psp)(CH&#8323;CN)&#8322;](ClO&#8324;)&#8322;}[infinity], {[Ni(psp)(NO&#8323;)&#8322;]}[infinity] and {[Ag(msm)](X)}[infinity] (X = BF&#8324;&#8315;, ClO&#8324;&#8315;, PF&#8326;&#8315;) displayed anion-[pi] interactions between multi-atomic anions and [pi]-acidic ring centres. A novel N[pz]&#65533;&#65533;&#65533;cent[pz] T-shaped [pi]-[pi] interaction was also identified in the {[Ni(psp)(NO&#8323;)&#8322;]}[infinity] structure. A 2-D sheet with 6&#65533; topology was observed in the X-ray structure of {[Ag&#8322;(csc)](NO&#8323;)&#8322;}[infinity]. 
 Following a review of related ligands, chapter four focuses on seven Ag(I), Cd(II), Co(II) and Cu(I) complexes formed using the asymmetric pyrazine-benzene ligand psb. In total six 1-D coordination polymer chains are reported. Two structurally disparate supramolecular isomers were formed in [Ag(psb)NO&#8323;][infinity] and {[Ag&#8322;(psb)&#8322;NO&#8323;]NO&#8323;&#65533;H&#8322;O}[infinity]. The compound {[Ag(psb)](BF&#8324;)}[infinity] was similar to the former isomer [Ag(psb)NO&#8323;][infinity]. The structurally similar coordination polymers {[Cd(psb)(H&#8322;O)(NO&#8323;)&#8322;]}[infinity] and {[Co(psb)(H&#8322;O)&#8323;](ClO&#8324;)&#8322;&#65533;H&#8322;O}[infinity] formed structures that showed anion-[pi] interactions using coordinated and non-coordinated anions respectively. The [Cu&#8322;(psb)I&#8322;][infinity] chain consisted of ligands linked together by a Cu&#8324;I&#8324; stepped cubane tetramer. 
 Chapter five presents seventeen Ag(I) and Cu(I) complexes prepared using three asymmetric pyrazine-pyridine ligands psd, psn and psy. A review of asymmetric pyrazine-pyridine ligands is provided. Seventeen X-ray crystal structures are described. Four psd complexes using AgBF&#8324;, AgClO&#8324;, AgNO&#8323; and AgPF&#8326; crystallised as discrete dimers with three types of crystal packing and ligand-supported Ag&#65533;&#65533;&#65533;Ag interactions. The complexes {[Ag&#8322;(psd)&#8322;CF&#8323;SO&#8323;]CF&#8323;SO&#8323;}[infinity] and {Cu&#8322;(psd)I&#8322;}[infinity] were a 1-D X-shaped chain and a 2-D 6&#65533; net respectively. The isostructural 2-D sheets in {[Ag(psn)]ClO&#8324;}[infinity] and {[Ag(psn)]PF&#8326;&#65533;CH&#8323;CN}[infinity], had 4.8&#65533; topologies whereas a thicker sheet was formed in {[Ag&#8322;(psn)&#8322;](BF&#8324;)&#8322;}[infinity] with a complicated (4&#65533;.6&#65533;.8&#65533;)&#8322;(4.6.8)&#8322; topology. The {[Ag&#8323;(psn)&#8322;](CF&#8323;SO&#8323;)&#8323;&#65533;CH&#8323;CN}[infinity] chain polymer displayed three different coordination geometries around the three Ag(I) centres with two ligand-unsupported Ag&#65533;&#65533;&#65533;Ag interactions. The complex [Cu&#8322;(psn)&#8322;I&#8322;] crystallised as a discrete dimer with a different ligand arrangement than those found in the psd dimers. Six Ag(I) 3-D networks were formed using psy. The complexes {[Ag(psy)]X}[infinity] (X = BF&#8324;, ClO&#8324;, PF&#8326;) formed as isostructural non-interpenetrated (10,3)-d networks. An unprecedented tri-nodal (4.6.8)&#8322;(6.8&#65533;)&#8322;(4.6.8&#65533;.10)&#8322; topology was observed in the {[Ag&#8322;(psy)&#8322;](CF&#8323;SO&#8323;)&#8322;}[infinity] structure. The suprarmolecular isomers {[Ag&#8323;(psy)&#8322;(NO&#8323;)&#8322;]NO&#8323;]}[infinity] and {[Ag&#8323;(psy)&#8322;(NO&#8323;)&#8323;]&#65533;H&#8322;O}[infinity] formed inclined interpenetrated 6&#65533; sheets and a (4&#65533;.6)&#8322;(4&#8308;.6&#65533;.8&#8312;.10) 3-D network respectively. The structures in this chapter showed a general trend of increasing dimensionality when progressing from psd to psn to psy.

Axel</field><field name="description">Terahertz radiation refers to a specific part of the electromagnetic spectrum, flanked by microwave and infrared radiation at the higher and lower frequency end respectively. This thesis is about the development of applications using a new source of pulsed, coherent light for the physical characterisation of solids in the pharmaceutical setting. 
 Terahertz radiation has excellent potential in the advancement of science but is, as yet, largely unexplored. Recent developments in semiconductor physics have made it possible to provide light at terahertz frequencies (a frequency of 1 THz equals a wavelength of 0.3 mm) in a relatively easy way. Light located in this range of the electromagnetic spectrum was very difficult to generate previously. It has unique properties in that it is possible to extract the full spectroscopic fingerprint of the materials by looking at the frequency response of the terahertz pulse. Here, vibrations of the whole molecule are probed rather than just the vibrations of single functional moieties within a molecules as is the case in infrared spectroscopy, which makes terahertz spectroscopy a very powerful tool for the analysis of the complex solid-state materials properties. 
 In addition to structural information it easily penetrates through most plastics and polymeric materials used as excipients for pharmaceutical tablets. It is therefore especially useful for non-destructive imaging applications. 
 At the example of polymorphic phase transitions, dehydration processes and crystallization experiments from the amorphous phase the potential of terahertz spectroscopy for pharmaceutical analysis was systematically investigated. In addition, a novel concept for using terahertz radiation in structural imaging of pharmaceutical dosage forms was developed. 
 The technology, thus far predominantly used for the analysis of inorganic materials and semiconductors in particular, is now mature enough for its application to a wider field and to help with the understanding of fundamental and exciting new challenges at the interface between physics and the life sciences. 
 Together with a comparison of this new technology to the established techniques in physical characterisation an initial attempt to understand and interpret the spectral information provided is presented. The potential for future applications is discussed.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">drugs</field><field name="subject">analysis</field><field name="subject">solid</field><field name="subject">dosage</field><field name="subject">terahertz</field><field name="subject">technology</field><field name="subject">spectrum</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070515.131938</field></doc><doc><field name="title">God&#65533;s governor : George Grey and racial amalgamation in New Zealand 1845-1853</field><field name="creator">Grant, Susannah</field><field name="description">The legend of Governor Grey is a major feature of nineteenth century New Zealand historiography. This thesis seeks to understand Grey as a real person. Acknowledging the past as a strange and foreign place, it argues that Grey (and previous interpretations of him) can only be understood in context. The intellectual milieu of liberal Anglicanism and Victorian structures of imperial authority are crucial to understanding Grey&#65533;s policies of racial amalgamation. 
 Focusing on Grey&#65533;s first governorship of New Zealand, 1845 - 1853, this thesis begins by exploring the imperial networks within which he operated. The members of Grey&#65533;s web gathered and shared information to further a range of different agendas - scientific, humanitarian, and political. Grey&#65533;s main focus was native civilisation. His ideas about race were informed by liberal Anglican theology, scientific investigation and personal experience. Grey believed in the unity and improvability of all mankind. His mission as governor was to elevate natives to a state of true equality with Europeans so that all could progress together still further up the scale of civilisation. This model formed the basis of Grey&#65533;s 1840 plan for civilising native peoples, in which he proposed a range of measures to promote racial amalgamation in Australia. 
 Between 1845 and 1853 Grey implemented those measures in New Zealand. He used military force and British law to establish peace and enforce Crown authority. He used economic policies to encourage Maori integration in the colonial economy. He built schools and hospitals and enacted legislation to encourage the best features of British culture and limit the effects of its worst. He also augmented his power and encouraged amalgamation through personal relationships, official reports and the structures of colonial authority. 
 Grey was driven by complex, sometimes contradictory motives including personal gain, economic imperatives and political pressures. His policies have had ongoing, often devastating effects, on Maori and on race relations in New Zealand. This thesis brings to light the ideas and attitudes which formed them. Grey understood himself as a Christian governor ordained to civilise Maori and join them with British settlers in accordance with God&#65533;s divine plan for improving humankind.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Maori (New Zealand people)</field><field name="subject">Torangapu</field><field name="subject">Politics</field><field name="subject">Government</field><field name="subject">Sir George Grey (1812-1898)</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070427.112933</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Human papillomavirus E6 regulation of E-cadherin : a mechanistic and functional study</field><field name="creator">Leong, Cheng-Mee</field><field name="description">The majority of human papillomavirus (HPV) types cause cutaneous and mucosal disease. Persistent infection with high-risk HPV types is the primary risk factor for the development of cervical cancer. The ability of the virus to persist is contributed to by numerous immune evasion mechanisms. We previously demonstrated that the HPV type 16 (HPV16) E6 protein, down-regulates epithelial (E)-cadherin expression and that the associated Langerhans cells (LC) depletion may contribute to impaired immune recognition by the host. 
 The aims of this study were firstly to establish if E6 down-regulation of E-cadherin is conserved amongst all HPV types, secondly to determine if the reduced E-cadherin expression correlates with reduced LC density in HPV-infected tissues, thirdly, to identify a region of E6 responsible in E-cadherin regulation and fourthly to establish if down-regulation of cell surface E-cadherin also occurs in another DNA tumour virus, adenovirus (Ad). 
 E6 protein from a range of HPV types representing the &#945;, &#946; and &#947; genera was expressed in HCT116 cells and the effect on cell surface E-cadherin expression was measured by flow cytometry. In addition, a series of tissues infected with HPV types representative of HPV of &#945;, &#946;, [nu] and &#947; genera were stained to confirm E-cadherin regulation in vivo and to determine the functional significance of E-cadherin expression in relation to LC localisation. In order to identify the region of the E6 protein that was important for E-cadherin regulation, a series of HPV16 E6 mutants were tested for their ability to regulate E-cadherin. Finally, the effects of Ad on cell surface E-cadherin were examined by measuring E-cadherin expression in Ad infected HCT116 cells. 
 E6 down-regulation of E-cadherin was conserved in &#945;, [nu] and &#947; genera but was lost in &#946;-HPV types, correlating with the ability of the virus to persist. In vivo analysis of patient tissues confirmed this pattern of E-cadherin regulation by E6 types and showed a direct association between loss of E-cadherin and LC depletion, suggesting that E-cadherin regulation by E6 is the cause of depletion of LC in infected tissue. Mutational analysis of HPV16 E6 led to the identification of a putative E-cadherin regulatory region with a conserved motif, H/L/V-[phi]-X-X-X-X-R. A potential mechanism used by E6 to regulate cell surface E-cadherin involved down-regulation of p21[waf1/cip1] (p21) via a p53-independent pathway. Finally, study of Ad showed a similar ability of the virus to regulate E-cadherin, indicating conservation in another DNA tumour virus. 
 This research shows that E-cadherin regulation by E6 is directly associated with LC depletion and viral persistence. The data presented here suggest that LC depletion by HPV is widely conserved in HPV types that cause persistent disease. E-cadherin regulation contributes to this effect through a specific regulatory region of the protein and manipulation of levels of cellular p21.

Phreatomagmatic activity driven by interaction of Karoo magma with groundwater hosted in country rock and crater-filling debris quarried broad, mainly shallow craters (hundreds of metres, but not kilometers deep) into wall-rock. Closely spaced individual vents, the consequence of magma emplaced over a broad area through a network of feeder dikes and stocks, were active at the same time or over short periods of time. Highly ephemeral access of external water to vents drove repeated and reversible switches between explosive to effusive magmatic and explosive phreatomagmatic activity, resulting in vents and craters that grew laterally and vertically into adjacent ones through quarrying and vent migration. 
 Deposits within the Sterkspruit crater complex are dominated by 7-15 km&#65533; of massive, unsorted polymict lapilli tuff and tuff breccia juxtaposed with localised fountain-fed lava and strombolian spatter deposits. Transport within the complex was dominated by jets and fountains of volcaniclastic debris and by mass movement. Country-rock breccias indicate that craters grew via a combination of mechanical fragmentation, granulation and mass-movement of 7-12 km&#65533; of wall-rock, adding mass and previously locked-up pore-water to the volcanic system. Ash and lapilli, the deposits of plumes 5-15 km high, form a 50-110 m-thick ejecta blanket mantling Clarens Formation country rock that thins gradually away from the crater-complex margins. Explosive volcanism was succeeded by brief fluvial and eolian reworking of volcaniclastic debris and formation of a shallow crater lake 12 km&#65533; in extent, and then by voluminous effusion of flood basalt that inundated the Sterkspruit crater complex with lava. 
 Flood basalt magmas involved in Sterkspruit eruptions were chemically heterogenous. This study documents the rapid (perhaps simultaneous) eruption of multiple, chemically distinct basaltic magmas, which cannot be simply related to one another, from one vent site, and possibly many others, within the Sterkspruit crater complex. Five distinct magma types were involved in eruptions at Sterkspruit, indicating that in the early stages of flood basalt eruption (i) magma batches may be small and not simply related to one another, (ii) heterogeneities in the magma source region may be close to each other in time and space, and (iii) eruptions of chemically distinct magmas may take place over short intervals of space and time without significant hybridisation. 
 Formation of the Sterkspruit Complex, and many others like it in South Africa, confirms that the opening phases of Karoo flood basalt volcanism were explosive, and that the volume of the products of explosive volcanism may have important implications for climate change and landscape development associated with the emplacement of large igneous provinces.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">South Africa</field><field name="subject">volcanological research</field><field name="subject">Sterkspruit</field><field name="subject">basalt</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070601.161342</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The genesis of organisational crisis : a theory-building approach</field><field name="creator">Seifert, Claudia</field><field name="description">The aim of this thesis is to improve our understanding of the causes of organisational crisis. As crisis genesis research is still in its infancy, the main objective is to develop a theoretical framework that is well-grounded in data of crisis-causal processes. 
 The first part of the literature review examines the need for crisis-causal research and comes to the following conclusions: Crises are significant phenomena for organisations. During crises, a company&#65533;s survival is threatened and its central functions are deeply affected. Although interest in crisis research developed strongly over the last decade, the field is still in a pre-paradigmatic stage that requires an inductive logic of inquiry. In addition, the majority of research in this field is focused on the consequences of crises. This preponderance towards crisis consequences leaves crisis-causal research under-theorised. Hence, theory-building on the genesis of organisational crisis represents an important gap that needs to be addressed. 
 The second part of the literature review presents the small field of extant causal research on crises as well as on crisis-related phenomena such as disasters. Insights of these studies are used to pre-specify potentially relevant constructs as well as to develop methodological implications for the subsequent theory-building task. 
 In this thesis a case study methodology is employed. Four cases of crisis-causal processes in large U.S. public companies were examined in-depth. Firstly, a within-case analysis was conducted. Secondly, the results of each case were compared in an across-case analysis. For both analyses, four analytical strategies were employed, namely a quantification strategy, a narrative strategy, a visual mapping strategy and, most importantly, a grounded theory strategy. 
 The results of the analysis are five well-grounded constructs that aim to explain the crisis-causal process common across cases. These constructs are the building blocks for two theoretical frameworks developed in this thesis. While the first framework presents a simple graphic depiction of these constructs, the second framework demonstrates how these constructs are linked. In general, the results suggest that a crisis is caused by a combination of company-specific factors and underlying dynamics that evolve through three distinct phases in an exponential fashion: a phase of stability (pre-crisis stage), a phase of increasing instability (crisis onset) and a phase of resolution (crisis and its aftermath). By setting up positive feedback loops that continually magnify the severity of problems generated by events, a self-reinforcing vicious cycle is established that increases the onset of crisis at an exponentional rate. 
 The results suggest that a crisis unfolds due to a problem structure which becomes increasingly intractable. This is accompanied by an increasing number of events that the organisation needs to deal with as it approaches the crisis point. In addition, three underlying dynamics were identified as crisis-contributing factors: a process of increasing denial, a process of decreasing degrees of freedom and a process of decreasing support of key players. 
 The thesis closes with a summary and discussion of the results. It is illustrated to what extent the theory developed in this work links to concurring and conflicting findings of the extant body of crisis knowledge.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">United States</field><field name="subject">crisis</field><field name="subject">industrial</field><field name="subject">management</field><field name="subject">bankruptcy</field><field name="subject">methodology</field><field name="subject">research</field><field name="subject">social sciences</field><field name="subject">organizational change</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070608.100146</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Eduardo Mendoza&#65533;s Ceferino series : spanish crime fiction and the carnivalesque</field><field name="creator">Trotman, Tiffany Gagliardi</field><field name="description">In the wake of Francisco Franco&#65533;s long dictatorship, various new forms of literature emerged in Spain. A new period of transformation, the so-called Spanish Transition, fostered an environment of experimentation and innovation free from the restrictive barriers of Franco&#65533;s regime. The Transition proved a period of great hopes and expectations as well as disillusionment and disappointment. This time, above all, provided an opportunity to reflect critically on the history and experience of the nation in the 20th century. 
 Eduardo Mendoza is one among a generation of writers that experienced the early years of the Transition, the subsequent emergence of the Socialist Party and the reintroduction of Spain to Europe and, indeed, the rest of the world post 1975. This noted Catalan is one of several distinguished writers working within a new genre, the Spanish novela negra, or crime novel. In particular, he has written three novels El misterio de la cripta embrujada (1979), El laberinto de las aceitunas (1982) and La aventura del tocador de senoras (2001); each featuring an unlikely detective known as Ceferino. 
 In this thesis, I examine Eduardo Mendoza&#65533;s three crime novels as a carnivalesque discourse. The work relies on the theory outlined by Mikhail Bakhtin in two of his foundational texts, Problems of Dostoevsky&#65533;s Poetics (1929) and Rabelais&#65533; World (1940). In 1929, Bakhtin sketched out the idea of "carnivalization" as the transposition of the spirit of carnival into art. It was not until his thesis (now known as Rabelais&#65533; World) was published in 1960 however that his vision of carnival was understood and the link between the carnivalized text and popular culture emerged. This research focuses on Bakhtin&#65533;s four 'categories of carnival': free and familiar contact, eccentricity, carnivalistic mesalliances, and profanation, in order to develop a critical framework by which a text may be defined as carnivalesque. Through a comprehensive examination of what each of these categories entails, Bakhtin&#65533;s paradigm is linked to Eduardo Mendoza&#65533;s crime trilogy and these texts are consequently defined as undeniably carnivalesque. 
 The conclusion of the thesis suggests several possibilities as to why Eduardo Mendoza, as a contemporary Spanish crime fiction writer, employs a carnivalesque discourse to depict post-Franco culture. The Transition and the decade between 1982 and 1992 are defined as periods of rupture from the official order. These years are considered an ideal environment for the unleashing of a carnivalesque ambiance in Spain that inherently effected the aesthetic production of the period, and specifically the works of Eduardo Mendoza.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Eduardo Mendoza (1943)</field><field name="subject">Spanish</field><field name="subject">fiction</field><field name="subject">criticism</field><field name="subject">detective</field><field name="subject">mystery</field><field name="subject">stories</field><field name="subject">Aventura del tocador de senoras</field><field name="subject">Laberinto de las aceitunas</field><field name="subject">Misterio de la cripta embrujada</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070613.114325</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Inferring transcriptional regulation in mammals using bioinformatics</field><field name="creator">Zadissa, Amonida</field><field name="description">Gene expression and its regulation is a highly coordinated system, involved in many biological processes such as cell growth, division and differentiation. Transcriptional regions, involved in gene regulation, consist of a heterogeneous collection of smaller regulatory elements. In some cases, co-regulated genes contain a common set of transcription factor binding sites (TFBS). 
 Analysis of promoter regions is the major approach in understanding the transcriptional regulatory mechanisms. It is also useful for interpretation of mammalian gene expression studies, where co-expressed genes may share motifs representing putative TFBS. Motif identification also has the advantage that it can predict control regions in genes that have not been measured experimentally. However, a common problem is incomplete genomic sequence for the experimental species of interest. The approach here is to identify and use orthologous gene promoter sequences from a related and well-characterised species. 
 The primary aim of this study was to identify and predict regulatory TFBS in species where promoter sequence does not exist or is incomplete. The MEME programme was employed for the motif prediction step. The predicted elements were subsequently compared to known TFBS using TRANSFAC and JASPAR databases for identification. A methodology based on relative entropy was used. The validity of the method was confirmed as the predicted motifs in the training set were the expected sites involved in regulation of muscle development. The technique was applied to two data sets, generated from expressed sequence tag (EST) clustering analysis and microarray experiments. All data sets, software and results are available on the accompanying CD. 
 Bovine expression data was analysed for cardiac-specific expression using two separate approaches, combining bovine library EST frequency and human gene expression ratios. For each approach, the orthologous human and bovine promoter sequences were analysed for common motifs. Across all comparisons, 37% of motifs were identified as known TFBS using the TRANSFAC and JASPAR databases. As the human comparison had more promoter sequences available, this was the main limiting factor for the corresponding bovine analysis, rather than cross-species divergence or accuracy of gene expression measurement. Results from this study demonstrate that using promoter sequences from a related species is a viable approach when studying gene expression in species with limited amount of genomic sequence. As the bovine genome becomes more complete, it can in turn serve as the reference genome for other agriculturally important ruminants, such as sheep, goat and deer. 
 The second application concerned in silico analysis of gene regulation patterns in response to stimuli. Recently it has been shown that a mutation in the bone morphogenetic receptor IB leads to an increased ovulation rate in sheep. The objective of this study was to analyse gene expression patterns in cultured cells in response to four members of the BMP family, i.e. BMP2, BMP4, BMP6 and BMP7 and the control TGF&#946;. Microarray data was provided by J. Young. Twelve highly upregulated genes were stimulated by all BMPs, seven of which are known BMP target genes. Analysis of the predicted motifs identified four elements that may be involved in the regulation process. Cross-species comparison for one of the genes, ID1, showed high conservation of one of the motifs across 11 mammalian genomes. This particular motif had not been identified as a known binding site. In summary, the analysis of the expression data suggest an extension of the list of BMP targets. 
 The proposed method is relatively robust when sufficiently co-expressed (co-regulated) sequences can be identified, whether from the same or another species.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">bioinformatics</field><field name="subject">gene expression</field><field name="subject">data processing</field><field name="subject">transcription factors</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070614.111340</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Martial Epigrammata Book X : a commentary</field><field name="creator">Francis, Charlotte</field><field name="description">This thesis represents the first full-scale commentary on Book 10 of Martial&#65533;s Epigrams.

My commentary provides an exploration of programmatic and structural issues which contribute to the book&#65533;s thematic continuity and unity.

[Rom 12:2] 
 Hans Urs von Balthasar and Eberhard Jungel are profound and imaginative thinkers who unreservedly ground their theologies in revelation as God&#65533;s self-disclosure. This thesis asks what resources such revelation-centred authors, from different traditions, may contribute to a theological understanding of the human imagination. Although theology has often been more interested in the constructive capacities of the imagination, it is the responsive quality of the imagination that is of particular interest to this thesis. Can the imagination contribute to a theological understanding which comprehends the action and speech of God as antecedent to human response? 
 This thesis examines the epistemological issues that are related both to the imagination and to revelation as the self-communication and self-interpretation of God. The imagination is conceived of as essential to perception and understanding; it allows for both recognition and re-cognition. Through the imagination we can rethink the patterns or paradigms that shape our lives. The renewing of the mind can be said to involve the imagination. However, spiritual transformation requires more than a notion of the imagination as a spontaneous mental act which determines its own content. Balthasar and Jungel, while thinking in lively and narrative ways, are constrained by divine self-disclosure. God&#65533;s self-revelation provides the content of the paradigm or pattern by which the Christian believer is to live. The imagination can be said to act as the context or locus of revelation. 
 This thesis demonstrates that the three days of Easter are central to Balthasar&#65533;s and Jungel&#65533;s respective understandings of God. For Balthasar and Jungel, the triduum mortis is where the self-revelation of God is most apparent; it is here that God is understood to be self-giving love as Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. While quite distinct in their approaches, both authors work within trinitarian, and therefore relational, frameworks. This thesis traces the motifs that not only express their understandings of the paschal mystery in relational terms but also ground their respective understandings of renewed existence; for Balthasar, the motifs of mission and kenosis, and for Jungel, those of identification and justification. For both Balthasar and Jungel, the events of the triduum mortis can be said to provide the content of, and act as a boundary to, our conception of God. Nonetheless, it is proposed that, within their respective understandings of divine prevenience, Balthasar and Jungel leave room for the exercise of the imagination. God is mystery; God is not a fixed or completed concept.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Hans Urs von Balthasar (1905-1988)</field><field name="subject">Eberhard Jungel</field><field name="subject">Trinity</field><field name="subject">God</field><field name="subject">Christianity</field><field name="subject">Revelation</field><field name="subject">Theory of Knowledge</field><field name="subject">religion</field><field name="subject">knowableness</field><field name="subject">history</field><field name="subject">doctrines</field><field name="subject">20th century</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070615.112629</field></doc><doc><field name="title">In vitro and in vivo studies on the absorption of mitoquinone</field><field name="creator">Li, Yan</field><field name="description">Mitoquinone (MitoQ&#8321;&#8320; mesylate) is a mitochondria-targeted antioxidant for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. As the oral bioavailability of mitoquinone is low in rat, it is necessary to better understand the mechanisms of its absorption in rat and in human. The aims of this thesis were 1) to investigate oral absorption mechanisms of mitoquinone in Caco-2 cell monolayers and in a rat intestinal tissue model; 2) to investigate the correlation between chemical structure and permeability of mitoquinone analogues in Caco-2 cell monolayers; and 3) to explore the hypothesis that active transport and/or drug metabolism contribute to the pharmacokinetics of oral mitoquinone in rat. 
 In Caco-2 studies, transport of mitoquinone was polarized with the apparent permeability (P[app]) from basolateral (BL) to apical (AP) (P[appBL to AP]) being &gt;2.5-fold the P[app] from AP to BL (P[appAP to BL]). The P[appBL to AP] value decreased by 26%, 31% and 61% by P-glycoprotein (P-gp) inhibitors verapamil 100 [mu]M, cyclosporine A (CsA) 10 [mu]M and CsA 30 [mu]M, respectively, whereas the P[appAP to BL] increased 71% by CsA 30 [mu]M. Some of the intracellular mitoquinone was reduced to mitoquinol and subsequently metabolized to glucuronide and sulfate conjugates. Apical effluxes of mitoquinol sulfate and mitoquinol glucuronide conjugates were significantly decreased by cyclosporine A 30 [mu]M and the breast cancer receptor protein (BCRP) inhibitor, reserpine 25 [mu]M, respectively. In the presence of 4% bovine serum albumin on the BL side, the P[appAP to BL] was 4.52 &#65533; 0.92 x 10&#8310; cm/s. Based on a absorption-disposition model, F[a] value of mitoquinone in human is estimated to be 56%. 
 A bellshaped relationship exists between the Caco-2 permeability of mitoquinone analogues and their lipophilicity. Permeability of mitoquinone analogues initially increases as lipophilicity increase, reaches a maximum, and then decreases due to significant cellular accumulation and active efflux. The physicochemical parameters of mitoquinone and its analogues (such as log P or polar surface area) alone do not predict their permeability across the cell membranes. 
 The bidirectional transport of mitoquinone displays polarity across rat ileal mucosa. The P[app] from s to m (P[app s to m) of mitoquinone decreased and P[app m to s] increased but not significantly by P-gp inhibitor CsA 30 [mu]M. The tissue accumulation of mitoquinone was ~16% of the total amount of mitoquinone added. In addition, several phase I and one phase II metabolites generated by rat ileum tissue were detected. 
 Results from pharmacokinetic studies indicate that mitoquinone was poorly (~24%) but rapidly absorbed and conjugated after oral administration. It was quickly excreted as unchanged drug and as its glucuronides (the major metabolites in rat) into intestine where it was reabsorbed. P-gp inhibition studies in rat indicate that inhibition of P-gp may increase the intestinal absorption of mitoquinone, but cannot change its oral bioavailability due to increased first-pass phase II metabolism and decreased enterohepatic recycling. 
 In conclusion, mitoquinone is poorly absorbed in rat but may be well absorbed in human. The barrier functions of intracellular metabolism and the action of P-gp to oral absorption of mitoquinone in human may be less significant, whereas P-gp play an important role in the absorption and disposition of mitoquinone in rat in vivo. These results, together with those from its analogues, demonstrate that the actual absorption profile of a compound depends on its intrinsic membrane permeability, transporter affinity, metabolizing enzyme affinity and plasma protein binding affinity.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">antioxidants</field><field name="subject">absorption</field><field name="subject">adsorption</field><field name="subject">physiology</field><field name="subject">nervous system</field><field name="subject">degeneration</field><field name="subject">treatment</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070615.135534</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Coxsackie and Adenovirus Receptor (CAR) expression is a potential limiting factor in adenoviral oncotheraphy</field><field name="creator">Wiles, Karen Anna</field><field name="description">Novel approaches to cancer treatment in the context of Gene Therapy have been gaining popularity as an alternative to conventional therapies which have proven to lack specificity, resulting in tumour cell resistance, tumour progression and mortality. As a consequence the use of adenoviruses has been widely developed not only as a replication deficient vector for gene therapy but also as a replication competent oncolytic agent designed to selectively target and kill tumour cells. Unfortunately their success in clinical application has been limited, and it has been suggested that a lack of the primary viral attachment receptor 'CAR' could be a barrier to infection by limiting access to target cells. If Ad/CAR binding is the rate limiting step for successful Ad therapy, it is essential to establish a CAR expression profile in normal and tumour tissue, and in tumour progression, to enable more effective targeted therapy. Furthermore, in the context of using adenovirus as an anticancer strategy by exploiting its replicative lysis, it is important to explore whether Ad success is affected by CAR expression and to identify factors downstream of CAR that may be influential in this process. 
 In the first experimental chapter, an in vivo immunohistochemical analysis of tissue array slides determined CAR expression in a range of normal and tumour tissue. CAR was differentially expressed dependent on cell of origin, with normal stem cells and basal cells displaying very high CAR, signifying its importance in early development and differentiation. Epithelial cells were also high in CAR but its expression was negligible in mesenchymal, lymphoid and neural cells. This trend was also reflected in most tumour tissue albeit with a general decrease in CAR compared to corresponding normal tissue of the same organ. An exception was the blastic tumours which displayed high CAR reflecting their embryonic state of derivation. CAR expression also decreased in high grade, poorly differentiated tumours of the prostate, stomach and breast compared to their well differentiated counterparts. 
 In the second experimental chapter, a more comprehensive study of breast cancer biopsy specimens was undertaken, to determine both the expression of CAR and the tumour suppressor gene p53 in relation to tumour grade. The rationale being that both loss of CAR expression and p53 mutation (resulting in loss of function), have been associated with tumour progression. It is possible that CAR and p53 interact directly or indirectly and may be modulated by each other. This study revealed a decrease in both CAR and hormone receptor expression and an increase in p53 'mutational' status with increasing tumour grade. These three factors when compared independently to tumour grade are statistically significant associations, implying that CAR expression and hormone responsiveness decrease with tumour progression and p53 function is compromised or lost via mutation. There was also a significant association between CAR expression and hormone receptor status, however a significant association between CAR expression and p53 status within the tumour grades was not found. 
 Treatment outcome with Ads will also depend on defining factors downstream of CAR attachment that affect adenovirus 'permissivity', which is ultimately measured by viral replication and cell death, relying on the bystander effect to eradicate all tumour cells. The in vitro analysis revealed statistically significant associations between CAR receptor expression, 'infectivity' (virus infection) and permissivity. Cell lines that were more susceptible to Ad5 were generally of epithelial origin, had high CAR, and were easily infected. However there were exceptions and CAR was not the sole determinant in adenovirus cell entry nor in its ability to replicate and kill the cell. Permissivity was also related to p53 status. Thus, although CAR expression may indeed be a limiting factor, it is apparent that a combination of other events contributes to a deficient infection, especially in the deregulated tumour environment. 
 The results presented in this thesis clearly demonstrate that there is more to the story of 'CAR' which hints that its role in viro-oncotherapy is not limited solely to its function as an attachment receptor for adenovirus but may also involve its function as a cell adhesion molecule and signal transducer. The further elucidation of these aspects of CAR&#65533;s potential role in the scheme of tumour biology may alter the course and strategy of cancer therapy in the future.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">viruses</field><field name="subject">adenoviruses</field><field name="subject">receptors</field><field name="subject">cancer</field><field name="subject">gene therapy</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070619.161353</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Non-culture based studies of the human upper respiratory tract microbiota and preliminary considerations of the influence of bacteriocin producing commensal and pathogenic oral streptococci</field><field name="creator">Power, Daniel Aaron</field><field name="description">The upper respiratory tract (URT) of humans is complex and interconnected region and comprises several major ecosystems including the oral cavity, oropharynx, nasal cavity, sinuses, nasopharynx and middle ear. Most of the anatomical locations within the URT are colonised with a normal bacterial microbiota, within which are often organisms having the potential to cause disease. The diseases of the URT are both varied and frequent in their occurrence, and conditions such as otitis media, rhinosinusitis and pharyngitis are sources of morbidity and mortality in adults and children in both developing and developed countries. 
 The study of diseases of the URT has traditionally been based on application of culture-based methods in which the infection-implicated organisms are first grown in vitro and then studied further. Ongoing advances in DNA-based techniques have led to the development of new molecular tools for the study of infectious diseases. One such technique is PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE). This is a PCR-based tool that allows the investigation of microbial communities independent of culture. Although this technique has been applied extensively in the study of the gastrointestinal tract, the vagina and endodontic infections in humans, there have been few reports of its application to URT infections. PCR-DGGE was applied in the present study to investigate (a) the bacteria present in the middle ear of children suffering from otitis media with effusion (OME), (b) the microbiota associated with the sinuses in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) and (c) perioperative changes in the bacterial population of the middle meatus of patients undergoing nasal or sinus surgery. The analysis of the middle ear fluid samples indicated an increased role in OME for the newly-discovered pathogen Alloiococcus otitidis and also the possible involvement of certain coryneform bacteria and coagulase-negative staphylococci in the aetiology of this condition. PCR-DGGE analysis of patients with CRS revealed a polymicrobial disease with considerable variability in the predominant species detected when multiple, serial samples were evaluated. The perioperative audit showed that when good clinical practice is adhered to, there was no apparent introduction of potentially-harmful organisms into the middle meatus. 
 Streptococcus salivarius is a common, commensal inhabitant of the oral cavity of humans and has also been shown to inhabit the nasopharynx of infants. S. salivarius is also a well known producer of bacteriocins with activity directed against Streptococcus pyogenes. One such strain, S. salivarius K12, is now marketed in New Zealand as the probiotic, K12 Throat Guard[TM]. In the present study, S. salivarius K12 was compared with two additional strongly-inhibitory S. salivarius (strains T18A and T30A) for activity against the common causative pathogens of otitis media. A paediatric formulation of strain K12 was also tested in a pilot clinical trial for its ability to colonise the URT of young children. Although the levels of colonisation of these subjects was not as high as typically obtained with use of the K12 Throat Guard[TM] formulation, it was considered that further development of the paediatric formulation is warranted, particularly with respect to use of a different pre-treatment regimen. In other studies, the molecular basis for the unusual in vitro inhibitory activity of S. salivarius strain T30A was investigated. Although this still remains unresolved, other observations made during the course of this study have led to the introduction of a schema for the division of inhibitory S. salivarius into three groups based on (a) their sensitivity to the lantibiotic salivaricin A and (b) the structure of their salivaricin A genetic locus. This grouping is analogous to the "rock-paper-scissors" system previously described for colicin-producing strains of E. coli. 
 Streptococcus pneumoniae is a major human pathogen responsible for a variety of diseases in humans. There have been very few reports of bacteriocin production by S. pneumoniae when compared to other streptococcal species. In the present study a putative cluster of bacteriocins encoded by the blp locus has been investigated. The distribution of the individual blp determinants within this locus was evaluated in a collection of S. pneumoniae strains using PCR. The blp genes were detected in 92% of 57 tested strains and a variant form (termed the B-form) of the cluster was identified that appeared to have arisen due to a genetic recombination event. In this case an approximately 250 bp portion of the blpMNO cluster appears to have recombined into blpK of the blpIJK cluster. Attempts were made to express the putative bacteriocin peptide genes in an Escherichia coli expression system. Failure to achieve expression was taken to indicate that these bacteriocin-like peptides may be toxic for the host producer cells under these test conditions. Future attempts to achieve expression of the Blp peptides, could explore the use of different fusion proteins, a Gram-positive expression host or a cell-free protein expression system.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">respiratory</field><field name="subject">organs</field><field name="subject">microbiology</field><field name="subject">pathophysiology</field><field name="subject">pathogenesis</field><field name="subject">streptococcus</field><field name="subject">pyogenes</field><field name="subject">streptococcal infections</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070620.160726</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Subadult health and disease in late prehistoric mainland Southeast Asia</field><field name="creator">Halcrow, Sian Ellen</field><field name="description">There is a general belief that a decline in health of prehistoric people occurred with the adoption and intensification of agriculture. However, recent bioarchaeological research in Southeast Asia does not seem to fit this model. An investigation of subadult health is particularly useful to assess this issue because immature individuals are very responsive to environmental changes. The increase of archaeological investigation in this region has provided an adequate sample to address this important aspect of human health using subadults. 
 The aim of this thesis was to produce a synthesis of subadult health and disease from late prehistoric Mainland Southeast Asia and assess whether there was evidence for a change in health with agricultural intensification. The samples, comprising a total 325 individuals, are from seven sites in Thailand, six from the Northeast and one from the Southeast coast, and collectively span from c. 4000 to 1500 B.P. Two hypotheses were developed based on previous bioarchaeological research in Southeast Asia. Firstly, there would be maintenance in health with the intensification of agriculture. Secondly, contrary to the first hypothesis, an increase in infectious disease in the later samples was predicted. 
 A biocultural research approach was used, where health and disease were assessed in relationship to evidence of the natural and cultural milieu. A comparative analysis of health indicators was carried out among the sites to assess whether there were any changes in health over time in response to environmental changes. Non-specific indicators of health were used in the assessment of palaeodemography, growth, growth disruption, dental health and skeletal pathology. 
 Analysis of mortality, fertility, growth, growth disruption and dental health found no differences among the sites that could be explained by temporality. These results support the first hypothesis, that health was maintained. The skeletal pathology results tentatively suggested an increase in these indicators in the later sites. An analysis of multiple indicators of stress in the populations indicated a possible decline in health, interpreted with environmental evidence suggesting an increase of infectious disease at the later sites. However, they suggest that the earliest site of Khok Phanom Di had extremely poor health. Thus, the second hypothesis was only partially supported. 
 Environmental evidence was used to provide possible explanations for these results. The heterogeneity of the health indicators support recent interpretations of localised environments of the sites. Also, retention of a broad-spectrum subsistence economy with agriculture may have overridden some of these changes that were seen in other parts of the world. Khok Phanom Di and the later sites were undergoing major changes in their natural and cultural environment, which could have resulted in an increase of infectious disease. These health results are consistent with suggestions that Khok Phanom Di was a distinct genetic population from those at the Northeast Thai sites. This biocultural interpretation emphasises the importance of understanding the environmental context in which these people lived.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Southeast Asia</field><field name="subject">children</field><field name="subject">health</field><field name="subject">hygiene</field><field name="subject">diseases</field><field name="subject">paleopathology</field><field name="subject">prehistoric</field><field name="subject">history</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070621.161132</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Generating sporadic association rules</field><field name="creator">Koh, Yun Sing</field><field name="description">Association rule mining is an essential part of data mining, which tries to discover associations, relationships, or correlations among sets of items. As it was initially proposed for market basket analysis, most of the previous research focuses on generating frequent patterns. This thesis focuses on finding infrequent patterns, which we call sporadic rules. They represent rare itemsets that are scattered sporadically throughout the database but with high confidence of occurring together. As sporadic rules have low support the minabssup (minimum absolute support) measure was proposed to filter out any rules with low support whose occurrence is indistinguishable from that of coincidence. There are two classes of sporadic rules: perfectly sporadic and imperfectly sporadic rules. Apriori-Inverse was then proposed for perfectly sporadic rule generation. It uses a maximum support threshold and user-defined minimum confidence threshold. This method is designed to find itemsets which consist only of items falling below a maximum support threshold. However imperfectly sporadic rules may contain items with a frequency of occurrence over the maximum support threshold. To look for these rules, variations of Apriori-Inverse, namely Fixed Threshold, Adaptive Threshold, and Hill Climbing, were proposed. However these extensions are heuristic. Thus the MIISR algorithm was proposed to find imperfectly sporadic rules using item constraints, which capture rules with a single-item consequent below the maximum support threshold. A comprehensive evaluation of sporadic rules and current interestingness measures was carried out. Our investigation suggests that current interestingness measures are not suitable for detecting sporadic rules.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">data mining</field><field name="subject">sporadic</field><field name="subject">groups</field><field name="subject">mathematics</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070711.115758</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effect of dietary phytoestrogens on male fertility</field><field name="creator">Glover, Amy</field><field name="description">Phytoestrogens are plant-derived compounds with oestrogenic activity. They are common in both human and animal diets, particularly through soy-based foods. This study assessed whether the reproductive function of male rats is affected by exposure to a high phytoestrogen diet during adulthood and examined possible mechanisms through which phytoestrogens may disrupt reproductive function. Experiments focused on the epididymis, a steroid-regulated organ responsible for the maturation, transport, and storage of sperm. 
 Adult male rats, bred and raised on a low phytoestrogen diet, were either transferred to a high phytoestrogen diet (experimental), or remained on the low phytoestrogen diet (control). Litter size is a measure of fecundity and after 3 days on the high phytoestrogen diet litter size was reduced. This effect on fecundity was transient as litter sizes returned to control levels by day 12. The reduced fecundity at day 3 could not be explained by changes in sperm concentration. Plasma gonadotrophin levels and testicular testosterone levels were not affected by phytoestrogen exposure, however, the expression of steroid hormone receptors in the epididymis was affected, coincidental with reduced fecundity. The gene expression of oestrogen receptor alpha and androgen receptor was increased in the initial segment of the epididymis and decreased in the cauda epididymis. Additionally, lipid peroxidation of epididymal sperm was significantly increased in rats fed the high phytoestrogen diet for 3 days. 
 It is concluded that acute exposure to the high phytoestrogen diet disrupts the steroid regulation of the epididymis, disrupting its normal function. This results in decreased sperm quality, thereby reducing fecundity.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">fertility</field><field name="subject">endocrine</field><field name="subject">phytoestrogens</field><field name="subject">human</field><field name="subject">fertility</field><field name="subject">men</field><field name="subject">physiology</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070711.140602</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluating the impact of a national hospital pharmaceutical strategy in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Tordoff, June Margaret</field><field name="description">Background: In September 2001, in addition to their existing management of primary care pharmaceutical expenditure, PHARMAC, the New Zealand government&#65533;s Pharmaceutical Management Agency, was authorized to manage pharmaceutical expenditure in public hospitals.[1] In February 2002 PHARMAC launched a three-part Strategy, the National Hospital Pharmaceutical Strategy (NHPS), for this purpose.[2] The Strategy focused on Price Management (PM), the Assessment of New Medicines (ANM), and promoting Quality in the Use of Medicines (QUM). Major initiatives planned were: for PM, to negotiate new, national (as opposed to current, local) contracts for frequently used pharmaceuticals; for ANM, to provide economic assessments of new hospital medicines; and for QUM, to coordinate activities in hospitals. 
 Aims: To assess the impact of each of the three parts of the National Hospital Pharmaceutical Strategy, and assess any impact of the Strategy&#65533;s new contracts on the availability of those medicines. 
 Methods: Price Management was assessed in 2003, 2004 and 2005 using data from eleven selected hospitals to estimate savings for all 29 major hospitals, and by tracking hospital pharmaceutical expenditure from 2000 to 2006. For other aspects, cross-sectional surveys were administered to chief pharmacists at all hospitals employing a pharmacist; 30 hospitals in 2002, 29 in 2004. Surveys were undertaken in 2002 and 2004 to examine ANM and QUM activity in hospitals before and after the Strategy. Surveys were undertaken in 2004 and 2005 to examine any changes in the availability of medicines on new contracts, in hospitals. In 2005 a survey was undertaken of opinions on PHARMAC&#65533;s specially-developed pharmacoeconomic (PE) assessments. 
 Results: PM results indicated that, by 2006, savings of $7.84-13.45m per annum (6-8%) had been made on hospital pharmaceutical expenditure, and growth in inpatient pharmaceutical expenditure appeared to slow for all types of hospitals in 2003/4. ANM surveys indicated that, by 2004, hospital new medicine assessment processes, predominantly formal, became more complex, more focused on cost-effectiveness, and the use of pharmacoeconomic information increased. The PE survey indicated that PHARMAC&#65533;s economic assessments of new medicines were mainly viewed favourably but were not sufficiently timely to be widely used in hospital formulary decisions. Availability surveys indicated that new contracts occasionally caused availability problems e.g. products that were "out of stock", or products considered inferior by respondents. Problems were usually resolved within weeks, but some took over a year. QUM activities showed little change between surveys, but during the period an independent organisation was formed by the District Health Boards of New Zealand, with representation from PHARMAC, to coordinate the Safe and Quality Use of Medicines in New Zealand. 
 Conclusion: The National Hospital Pharmaceutical Strategy has been moderately successful in New Zealand. Savings of NZ$7.84-13.45m per annum were made, and growth in inpatient pharmaceutical expenditure appeared to slow in the year following the Strategy&#65533;s launch. The study has indicated some important short-term effects from the Strategy, but further research is needed to ensure that favourable effects are sustained and unfavourable effects kept to a minimum. Similar, centralized, multifaceted, approaches to managing pharmaceutical expenditure may be worth considering in other countries.

We hypothesised that 9p21 deletion in childhood ALL may unmask predisposing genetic events that would allow us to determine the "nature" of initiating events in childhood ALL; whereas the inclusion, or exclusion, of random &#65533;N&#65533; nucleotides in normal immunoglobulin gene rearrangements from the developing fetus and the expression of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) in fetal lymphocytes may allow us to unmask the developmental window during which the first transforming leukaemic event occurs in a pre-leukaemic B cell. 
 The most frequent genetic abnormality in childhood ALL is deletion of chromosome 9p21, with the minimal region of deletion including the CDKN2-locus, making genes at this locus candidates for a predisposing genetic event in ALL. To determine whether genomic imprinting might be involved in ALL at the 9p21 locus we investigated the imprinting status of the candidate genes CDKN2A, CDKN2B and ARF. No evidence for genomic imprinting of ARF was found in this study. Because no expressed polymorphisms could be identified for CDKN2B, and CDKN2A expression was too low in normal tissues, the imprinting status of these genes could not be evaluated. Furthermore investigations in our laboratory have been unable to find genomic imprinting at any of these genes in mice. However, we have shown variation in allelic expression of ARF, which suggests a role for ARF haploinsufficiency in the onset of childhood ALL. 
 A key feature of early human fetal lymphoid development is the absence of random &#65533;N&#65533; nucleotides between the rearranged V[H], D[H] and J[H] gene segments. The addition of &#65533;N&#65533; nucleotides at these junctions requires the enzyme terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT). TdT is reported to not be expressed during early fetal lymphopoiesis but has been observed by the end of the first trimester, but data are sparse. 
 The reported absence of N nucleotides in the majority of childhood ALLs suggests an early fetal origin. By defining the window-in-time during which TdT-negative B cell development occurs, we will be able to refine the timing of the origin of the B cells that give rise to ALL. Therefore we have sequenced and analysed the V[H]-DJ[H] and D[H]-J[H] junctions from immunoglobulin rearrangements in developing B cells in normal human fetuses aged from 5.1 to 11 weeks gestation. 
 In this study 73 fetal IgH gene rearrangements were amplified from 21 different fetal liver samples. Only eight of the seventy-three rearrangements (11%) analysed in this study had no &#65533;N&#65533; nucleotides at the N1 (D[H]-J[H]) junction. This finding contrasts with the 24-28% of fetal rearrangements with no &#65533;N&#65533; nucleotides that have been reported in the literature. Furthermore, &#65533;N&#65533; nucleotides were shown to be present in the earliest sample, 5.1 weeks gestation. TdT expression was demonstrated by immunohistochemistry at 7.3 weeks and by RT-PCR at 8.3 weeks. B cell development in the fetal liver was detected as early as 6.5 weeks using flow cytometric analysis. 
 Then, IgH gene rearrangements from 99 cases of childhood ALL were analysed. In total, 134 clone-specific IgH gene rearrangements were examined in this study. No association was found between the number of &#65533;N&#65533; nucleotides from complete and incomplete rearrangements at either the N1 (D[H]-J[H]) or N2 (V[H]-DJ[H]) junctions. Nor was any association observed between ALLs from children [less than or equal to] 3 years of age and those &gt;3 years of age at diagnosis. These findings indicate that ALL IgH rearrangements do not have the paucity of &#65533;N&#65533; nucleotides that has been previously reported. 
 The findings in this thesis suggest that there is no TdT-negative timepoint during B cell development and that there is no paucity of &#65533;N&#65533; nucleotides at the N1 junction in either fetal or childhood ALL IgH gene rearrangements.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">leukemia</field><field name="subject">acute</field><field name="subject">children</field><field name="subject">lymphoblastic</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070719.131918</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Executive compensation in New Zealand : 1997-2002</field><field name="creator">Roberts, Helen</field><field name="description">This study investigates the relationship between CEO pay and firm performance, the asymmetric nature of pay-performance sensitivity, and the effect of CEO participation on the pay-setting process, for publicly-listed New Zealand firms during 1997 to 2002. The research is conducted using a unique hand-collected panel data set containing information about executive compensation, firm performance, ownership, firm governance and CEO participation in the pay-setting process. The sample covers the six-year period following the introduction of mandatory disclosure requirements that were imposed on executive and director compensation in 1997. 
 An initial descriptive analysis of the data reveals a large pay difference between worker and CEO pay. In addition, pay-performance indexes for the highest and lowest paid CEOs document differences between the change in pay relative to real shareholder returns. An examination of the sensitivity between growth in CEO pay, and contemporaneous and lagged firm performance using a firm fixed-effects model, shows that not only is pay significantly related to firm size and performance but also board size, compensation risk and director share ownership. 
 Models of the relationship between growth in CEO compensation and firm performance indicate the pay-performance sensitivity generated by cash and the change in the value of stock option holdings is reported to be three-times the magnitude of the sensitivity due to salary and bonus payments alone. In addition, growth in CEO compensation is asymmetrically related to changes in firm performance. CEO cash compensation is positively related to increases in firm value only. Total compensation is related to contemporaneous returns and positive lagged returns. Change in CEO wealth is positively related to contemporaneous returns but is more sensitive to losses. However, change in wealth also increases when lagged returns are positive and negative, implying that CEOs are able to extract pay in excess of that which is optimal under the contracting view of executive compensation. 
 Furthermore, firms in which CEOs demonstrate a low level of participation in the pay-setting process earn higher levels of pay, which also grows at significantly greater rates than their high-participation counterparts. In particular, growth in low-participation wealth is more sensitive to positive and negative contemporaneous returns as well as being negatively related to negative lagged excess returns. This finding is opposite to theoretical predictions and can be explained by the tightly held nature of the high-participation firms which typically have fewer directors, are exposed to higher return volatility and have greater director and CEO beneficial share ownership. 
 Consistent with the trickle-down effect, there is a positive relationship between growth in the non-performance related cash compensation awarded to CEOs and the growth in pay earned by their executive directors and employees. In addition, growth in non-CEO executive pay is not related to firm performance when there is an overpayment effect and CEOs exercise a high level of participation in the pay-setting process. Consistent with the contracting view, growth in non-CEO executive pay is positively related to firm performance with no benefits from CEO overpayments when stock option awards are included in the CEO pay contract.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">CEO</field><field name="subject">chief</field><field name="subject">executive</field><field name="subject">executives</field><field name="subject">officers</field><field name="subject">salaries</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">rating</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070803.113949</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Neuropsychological functioning of patients before and after undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery</field><field name="creator">Valentine, Sarah</field><field name="description">Cardiovascular disease (CVD) affects millions of people worldwide. Many of these people require treatment for their condition, and for roughly a million individuals each year, this treatment includes coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery - a procedure that aims to restore proper blood flow to the arteries of the heart. Although the physical impact of CVD and CABG surgery are well-known, their cognitive impact has not been clearly established. Recent studies suggest that both CVD and CABG surgery may have a detrimental effect on neuropsychological functioning. The first goal of the present study was to cognitively assess patients with severe, chronic CVD to determine the association of heart disease with neuroopsychological functioning. The second goal was to then continue monitoring these patients once they had undergone CABG surgery to establish what cogntive effect this treatment has. 
 CABG surgery has traditionally been performed with the aid of a cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) machine, but in the past decade, another technique, in which the heart remains beating, has been developed. Some have argued that this beating heart surgery (BHS) may be a superior alternative to the CPB procedure. Consequently, the third goal of the present study was to compare outcomes in patients undergoing these two surgical procedures. 
 The present study had a prospective, double blind design. Patients were randomly assigned to either CPB surgery (CPBS) or BHS. Sixty-three patients were recruited and underwent a comprehensive neuropsychological assessment preoperatively and 6 days, 6 weeks and 30 weeks postoperatively. 
 Despite including a higher risk group than previous comparative studies, there were virtually no differences between the CPBS and BHS groups. When the groups were combined and the sample was examined as a whole, the patients were cognitively impaired even before their surgery. Given that their premorbid abilities were estimated to be in the average range, their pre-surgery deficits were likely to be the result of a long-standing history of CVD. 
 Immediately after surgery (Day 6), the neuropsychological performance of the sample decreased further, but they had significantly improved by Week 6 and this improvement increased further by the Week 30 time-point (with many scores in the average range). This postoperative recovery suggests that the decline these patients exhibit preoperatively may be reversible and that rather than causing cognitive deficits, CABG surgery may ultimately improve both cardiac and cognitive health. 
 Psychologically, patients in the present sample reported the highest level of anxious and depressive symptoms, and the lowest quality of life, pre-surgically, but their psychological health gradually improved over the course of the postoperative period. Compared to other samples, however, the present sample were generally psychologically healthy.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">neuropsychological</field><field name="subject">tests</field><field name="subject">coronary</field><field name="subject">artery</field><field name="subject">bypass</field><field name="subject">patients</field><field name="subject">surgery</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070803.140127</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The relative importance of mainstream water velocity and physiology (nutrient demand) on the growth rate of Adamsiella chauvinii</field><field name="creator">Kregting, Louise Theodora</field><field name="description">A prevailing view exists in the literature which suggests that macroalgae growing in slow-flow environments (&lt;4 cm s&#8315;&#65533;) are less productive because of "mass-transfer" limitation compared to fast-flow environments. Macroalgae in slow-flow environments are thought to have thicker diffusion boundary-layers which limit the flux of essential molecules to and from the algal thallus. However nutrient demand of a macroalga can also influence nutrient flux. The main objective of this research was to determine the relative importance of physical (mainstream velocity) and physiological (nutrient demand) factors influencing the growth rate of Adamsiella chauvinii, a small (&lt;20 cm) red algal species, that grows within the benthic boundary-layer in a soft sediment habitat. To establish the influence of water velocity, the growth rate of A. chauvinii was measured in situ each month (March 2003 to March 2004) at three sites with varying degrees of water velocity (slow, intermediate and fast) at which all other environmental parameters (photon flux density, seawater temperature and nutrients) were similar. To determine the metabolic demand and nutrient uptake rate of A. chauvinii, the internal nutrient status (C:N, soluble tissue nitrate, ammonium and phosphate), uptake kinetics (V[max] and K[s]) and nutrient uptake rate at a range of mainstream velocities were also determined on a seasonal basis. The hydrodynamic environment around A. chauvinii canopies was characterised in situ and compared with controlled laboratory experiments. 
 Growth rates of Adamsiella chauvinii thalli at the slow-flow site were significantly lower in winter (June) to summer (February) than the intermediate- and fast-flow sites, while in autumn growth rates were similar between sites. However, A. chauvinii at the slow-flow site had similar or higher tissue N content compared to thalli at the other two sites during winter, spring and summer suggesting that growth rates of A. chauvinii were not mass-transfer limited. Nitrogen uptake rates of A. chauvinii were similar between sites in summer and winter, however uptake rates were lower in summer compared to winter even though thalli were nitrogen limited in summer. Water velocity had no effect on nitrate uptake in either summer or winter and uptake of ammonium increased with increasing water velocity during summer only. Two hydrodynamically different environments were distinguished over a canopy of A. chauvinii, with both the laboratory and field velocity profiles in good agreement with each other. In the top half of the canopy, the Turbulent Kinetic Energy (TKE) and Reynolds stresses were greatest while in the bottom half of the canopy flow rates were less than 90 % of mainstream velocity (&lt; 1 cm s&#8315;&#65533;). 
 When considered together, the influence of water velocity on the growth rates of A. chauvinii was not completely clear. Results suggest that mainstream velocity had little influence on nutrient availability to A. chauvinii because of the unique hydrodynamic environment created by the canopy. Nutrients, especially ammonium and phosphate, derived from the sediment and invertebrates, may provide enough nitrogen and phosphate to saturate the metabolic demand of Adamsiella chauvinii, consequently, A. chauvinii is well adapted to this soft-sediment environment.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Otago</field><field name="subject">ecology</field><field name="subject">algology</field><field name="subject">red algae</field><field name="subject">microalgae</field><field name="subject">growth</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070806.121216</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The privilege against self-incrimination in civil proceedings between private parties in Australia and New Zealand : is derivative use immunity the answer?</field><field name="creator">Cotton, John</field><field name="description">This thesis addresses the problem of the privilege against self-incrimination ("the privilege") in civil proceedings between private parties in Australia and New Zealand. This problem has been recognised by judges, law reform bodies and legislators in both countries for twenty years. However, the legislative response has been inadequate. 
 The privilege is easily confused with other related concepts, particularly the right to silence in criminal proceedings. The reasons for the privilege in civil proceedings are not necessarily the same as for the right to silence. Care is therefore taken to define the terminology and scope of the thesis. It sets out the modern law on the privilege in civil proceedings between private parties. It describes how the privilege causes particular problems in those proceedings. It surveys the literature, finding that most of it concerns the right to silence. 
 The thesis draws heavily on the history of the privilege. It argues that, although witness privilege came from the common law, the privilege in interlocutory civil proceedings had its origins in the discretionary remedies devised by the courts of equity. They were sensitive to abuse of their remedies. For the same reason, modern prosecutors should not be encouraged to rely excessively upon evidence acquired through compulsory powers. 
 Derivative use immunity is one of several substitutes suggested for the privilege. The thesis looks at the various substitutes. It concludes that derivative use immunity is the only satisfactory substitute for the privilege in civil proceedings. 
 Derivative use immunity originated in the United States. The thesis looks closely at the American experience. The history and scope of the Fifth Amendment are discussed in detail, particularly the supposed removal of its protection from documents. This will show that the removal of the privilege from documents is not as simple as law reform bodies in Australia and New Zealand suggest. 
 Exaggerated claims have been made by Australian prosecutors about the problems caused by derivative use immunity. The claims are examined in the light of American case-law. This shows that an impossible burden is not imposed on prosecutors. The same point emerges when the thesis examines the operation of derivative use immunity under Australian certification procedures since 1995. 
 Particular procedural and legislative difficulties need to be addressed, particularly when derivative use immunity replaces the privilege in interlocutory proceedings. However, certification by the court has an important advantage. The court&#65533;s exercise of its discretion provides the flexibility which automatic statutory immunity lacks. 
 The question in the title is therefore answered in the affirmative. Derivative use immunity under a statutory certification procedure can provide the answer. Cooperation between the Commonwealth and States may be needed to overcome constitutional difficulties, but most other problems can be overcome if derivative use immunity is given a sound statutory basis.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">self-incrimination</field><field name="subject">civil</field><field name="subject">procedure</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070815.094307</field></doc><doc><field name="title">UVR exposure of NZ schoolchildren</field><field name="creator">Wright, Caradee Yael</field><field name="description">Excess exposure to solar ultraviolet radiation (UVR) is the only readily modifiable skin cancer risk factor, and childhood exposure is implicated in melanoma aetiology. To assist the design and evaluation of child sun protection interventions in the school and community context, this first comprehensive study used electronic monitors to record time-stamped, second-by-second UVR exposure of 325 children (from 28 randomly selected New Zealand primary schools) who kept a diary record of concurrent activities and sun-protective practices and completed a sun-related knowledge, attitudes and usual behaviours questionnaire. School principals and Health promoters (HPs) were interviewed about school and community sun protection efforts. 
 Using the Haddon matrix and Ottawa Charter of Health Promotion to guide research, four potential domains of influence were identified: the physical and social environments, protective products, and host (child). Two key outcomes identified were child UVR exposure and sun-protective practices. A path model was developed where potential influences on these outcomes included school, community, host factors (demographics, skin type, sun-related attitudes, and sun-related knowledge), and pattern of concurrent outdoor activity. Seven specific hypotheses were defined to investigate the effects of host, school and community factors on UVR exposure, sun-protective practices, and sun-related knowledge, attitudes and behaviours. 
 To test for the effects of host factors, day of the week and activity on UVR exposure and sun-protective practices, linear mixed models containing these factors and interactions between Year level-sex, activity-Year level and activity-sex, accounting for clustering within schools and allowing for repeated measures, were applied. Logistic regression with a random school effect was used to assess differences in scored student questionnaire items. Structural equation modelling was implemented to consider associations between sun-related knowledge, attitudes and behaviours, and other explanatory factors for variations in UVR exposure and sun-protective practices. 
 Three of the seven specific hypotheses were supported. There were statistically significant differences in UVR exposure by sex, skin type, day of the week and activity, and sex-activity and Year level-activity interactions. Passive pursuits were associated with the highest UVR exposure rates compared to outdoor active, travel and unclassified pursuits. 
 There were statistically significant differences in sun-protective practices by sex, ethnicity and skin type, and sex-activity and Year level-activity interactions. Girls tended to have higher sun protection scores than boys, but were more likely to sunbathe and use sunscreen. Children identifying with Pacific Island ethnicities had higher scores than children with other ethnicities, and children with Fitzpatrick skin types I and II had higher scores than children with skin types III, IV and V. 
 School and community factors were not associated with UVR exposure, sun-protective practices, sun-related knowledge, attitudes and behaviours, but school and HPs&#65533; scores were relatively high, reflecting the significant time and effort spent promoting youth sun protection. 
 Trends for Year level indicated that whereas child sun-related knowledge increased with Year level, attitudes and behaviours supportive of sun protection declined. When considering sun-related knowledge, attitudes and behaviours simultaneously, knowledge was only significantly associated with behaviours when mediated by attitudes. The study findings have implications for child sun protection interventions.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">sunburn</field><field name="subject">skin</field><field name="subject">cancer</field><field name="subject">ultraviolet radiation</field><field name="subject">physiological</field><field name="subject">effect</field><field name="subject">school</field><field name="subject">children</field><field name="subject">health</field><field name="subject">services</field><field name="subject">hygiene</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070817.093312</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Theism and explanation : a defence of scientific naturalism</field><field name="creator">Dawes, Gregory W</field><field name="description">The modern sciences are characterised by a methodological atheism. Even though religions offer what appear to be explanations of various facts about the world, such proposed explanations are not taken seriously within the sciences. Even if no natural explanation were available, it would be assumed that one exists. Is this merely a sign of atheistic prejudice, as some critics suggest? Or are there good reasons to exclude from science explanations that invoke a supernatural agent? My answer to this question has two parts. On the one hand, I concede the bare possibility that talk of divine action could constitute a potential explanation of some state of affairs, while noting that the conditions under which this would be true are unlikely ever to be fulfilled. On the other hand, I argue that a proposed explanation of this kind would rate poorly, when measured against our usual standards of explanatory virtue. Even if it were the only proposed explanation on offer, we would have good reason to seek an alternative.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Theism</field><field name="subject">explanation</field><field name="subject">religion</field><field name="subject">science</field><field name="subject">skepticism</field><field name="subject">philosophy</field><field name="subject">naturalism</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070815.134617</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The relationship between the long posterior sacroiliac ligament and the posterior sacrococcygeal plexus</field><field name="creator">McGrath, Maurice Christopher John</field><field name="description">The burden of non-specific low back pain in the population is substantial. Putative sacroiliac joint pain or 'sacroiliac syndrome' is a significant subset of this condition. Localisable pain over the long posterior sacroiliac ligament (LPSL) is often described as both a clinical sign and symptom of this syndrome. The aim of this qualitative morphological investigation was to investigate a potential basis for a patho-anatomic relationship between the long posterior sacroiliac ligament (LPSL) and the posterior sacrococcygeal plexus (PSP). Twenty-two cadavers were available for study. Three methods were utilised: macro-dissection (n = 22 sides), small wax block histology (n = 3 sides), large wax block histology (n = 1 side), giant wax block histology (n = 4 sides) and a review of E12 sheet plastinated transverse and sagittal sections (n = 4 sides). 
 The LPSL was demonstrated to have a layered structure that was penetrated by the lateral branches of the dorsal sacral rami. A segmental relationship was observed between the lateral branches of the dorsal sacral rami and the LPSL. The posterior layer of the thoracolumbar fascia was not continuous with the superficial layer of the LPSL, deep to the fibres of gluteus maximus. The LPSL was shown to have three morphologically distinct regions, the proximal, mid and distal LPSL. A confluence of three layers was observed at the mid LPSL posterior to the sacroiliac joint (SIJ) namely the erectores spinae aponeurosis (ESA), the gluteal aponeurosis (GA) and the deep fascial layer from the second and third medial dorsal sacral foramina. A region of adipose and loose connective tissue was evident deep to the deep fascial layer in which lateral branches of the dorsal sacral rami were observed. In the region of the mid LPSL between the inferior PSIS and the third sacral transverse tubercle (ST), the attachment of the ESA to sacral bone was absent. This space was occupied by the continuous underlying region of adipose and loose connective tissue. At its greatest extent, this region was observed between the central sacral canal medially and the gluteal aponeurosis laterally. This study suggests that the LPSL may be better described as a retinaculum for the lateral branches of the dorsal sacral rami. 
 These morphological findings provide a basis for the existence of a potential patho-anatomical mechanism that may explain localised pain in the posterior sacroiliac region, usually interpreted as referred pain from the sacroiliac joint. The lateral branches of the dorsal sacral rami may have a potential vulnerability to trauma or ischaemic challenge in this region, which may account for SIJ related 'non-specific' low back pain or for pregnancy related peripartum pelvic pain. Furthermore, a morphological basis for the anatomical confounding of SIJ tests is shown.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sacroiliac joint</field><field name="subject">anatomy</field><field name="subject">lumbosacral region</field><field name="subject">Sacrococcygeal region</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070824.142033</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Electroluminescent and photoluminescent properties of metal-based compounds</field><field name="creator">Lundin, Natasha J</field><field name="description">Organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) are an emerging display technology with the advantages of being efficient, bright, portable and flexible.

 The ground and excited state properties of the ligands and complexes were investigated by a range of techniques, including electrochemistry, absorption and emission spectroscopy, spectroelectrochemistry and excited state lifetime studies. Complexes of dppz-based ligands typically show MOs which are segregated over either the bpy or phz region of the dppz backbone. The properties of the Ru(II) and Ir(III) complexes of the ligand series investigated in this work were consistent with this model, and the LUMOs of these complexes were assigned as the b&#8321;(phz) phz-localised MO. The Re(I) and Cu(I) complexes of the ligand series appeared to show MOs which were delocalised over the entire dppz ligand. 
 A modular complex containing an electron transport group, hole transport group and emitting centre was synthesised. The complex fac-tricarbonyl(trans-(E)-1-((2,2&#65533;:5&#65533;,2&#65533;&#65533;-terthiophen)-3&#65533;-yl)-2-(4&#65533;-pyridyl)-ethane)(2-(11-dipyrido[3,2-a:2&#65533;,3&#65533;-c]phenazine)-5-phenyl-1,3,4-oxadiazole)rhenium(I) hexafluorophosphate was oxidised and reduced readily, encouraging efficient transport of both holes and electrons. However, this resulted in the complex having a small band gap and hence a low quantum yield of emission. Emission from this complex appeared to be from more than one state. 
 The complexes containing the dppz-based ligand series show complicated excited state behaviour. Emission behaviour is consistent with input from more than one state for many of the Re(I), Cu(I) and Ir(III) complexes. The Ru(II) complexes of the ligand series emit from a &#65533;MLCT state between metal-based and bpy-based MOs located on the dppz ligands, as is usual for complexes of this type. All complexes containing 11-cyanodipyrido[3,2-a:2&#65533;,3&#65533;-c]phenazine showed extremely short excited state lifetimes consistent with extremely efficient non-radiative deactivation of the excited state. 
 Ligands and complexes were incorporated into OLEDs with the structure [ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PVK:BuPBD:dopant/BCP/Alq&#8323;/LiF/Al] to test their ability to behave as emissive dyes. Many of the compounds behaved poorly as dopants due to their low emission quantum yields, and poor alignment of HOMO and LUMO energy levels with those of the other compounds within the device. &#65533;MLCT-based emission was achieved through energy transfer from the PVK host for the devices containing chlorotricarbonylrhenium(I) complexes of the ligand series. The OLEDs containing Ru(II) and Ir(III) complexes also emitted from dopant-centred &#65533;MLCT states. In these devices, dopant excitation appeared to occur through direct charge trapping from the adjacent hole transport and electron transport layers.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Light emitting</field><field name="subject">diodes</field><field name="subject">ligands</field><field name="subject">photoluminescence</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070516.113739</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Image and imagination : perspectives on Athenian naval influence in the fifth century BC</field><field name="creator">Turner, Gordon R. B</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the Athenian navy in the fifth century BC from the standpoint of its image, in terms of perception and reputation, in comparison and contrast to its fact, in terms of actuality and truth. It investigates features of cultural history based around and arising from the contemporary state of mind about Athens&#65533; naval ships and sailors, from the points of view of Athenians and outsiders. Its hypothesis is that the supremacy of Athens&#65533; navy and the integrity of Athens&#65533; naval society in the fifth century were partly products of the Athenian imagination, and in turn gave rise to a reputation for Athens&#65533; navy and sailors that itself helped to fulfil Athens&#65533; naval and related tasks. Methodologically, the arguments of the thesis are developed 'from the inside out', as they are derived essentially from the primary sources, and then engage with secondary sources where appropriate. The approach is holistic, with source material derived principally from history, literature, art, architecture, and on-site analysis, with extensive illustrations. The thesis is expansive. It begins by examining the perception of Athens&#65533; naval supremacy and invincibility by Athenians and outsiders, and the impact that this had upon Athens&#65533; ability to achieve her naval and related objectives. It then looks inwardly upon Athens herself, in order to assess Athens&#65533; own social attitude towards her naval oarsmen and their base and home at the Piraeus. In this respect, the thesis investigates the development of artistic and literary depictions of the oarsmen of Athenian ships from the eighth to the fifth centuries, and the conclusions to be drawn from their visibility or its lack. It then considers the relationship between Athens and the Piraeus, beginning with the foundations of the image of unity before contrasting that image with the reality of naval division, in terms of Ionianism, autochthony, administration, politics, cult, and the deceit of Athenicity. The thesis then casts its net from the Piraeus across the Aegean Sea, by assessing the roles of Samos and Delos in the perception of naval Athens. Lastly, the thesis examines a topic that combines those of Athens&#65533; navy, the Piraeus, and overseas involvement. This topic is the importance of the reputations of Athens&#65533; navy and of the Piraeus in overseas trade with Athens&#65533; allies and particularly non-allies; and, including social and legal considerations, for influential Athenian citizens who wished to protect their investments in maritime loans for the transit of essential goods to Athens. The thesis concludes that the influence of the Athenian navy was indeed a product of image as much as of fact.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Athens</field><field name="subject">Greece</field><field name="subject">history</field><field name="subject">naval</field><field name="subject">triremes</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070814.155342</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Embryonic stem cell research and the metaphysics of identity</field><field name="creator">Copland, Paul S</field><field name="description">Embryonic stem cell research has the potential to revolutionise both the practice of medicine and our understanding of the human body. Although the usual technical and financial limitations of research apply, perhaps the greatest obstacle to the progress of this research at the present time is the ethical concerns surrounding the destruction of early human embryos. The established debate over the ethical significance of the early embryo has thus taken on renewed importance. 
 Within biology stem cell research has begun to overturn some long held assumptions about the roles of genes and cellular interaction in development. Building on recent advances in stem cell biology I develop a concept of Form that neatly captures what it is to be individuals like us in biological terms. Form not only defines a biological individual that exists across time regardless of changes in its physical constituents but also provides the biological foundation for our higher mental properties and our identity as persons. 
 At the heart of the embryo debate is confusion over what human individuals are and therefore when they began. Defining when we began as the ethically significant individuals that we are now is the key to the embryo debate. Our metaphysics of identity is thus crucial to understanding the moral significance of the embryo. 
 Compared to alternative understandings of identity within the debate surrounding the embryo Form provides compelling reasons why the very early embryo, at the stage that embryonic stem cells are derived, lacks any right to life or associated ethical significance. The derivation of embryonic stem cells is thus found to be ethically permissible.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Stem cells</field><field name="subject">embryonic</field><field name="subject">moral</field><field name="subject">ethical</field><field name="subject">identity</field><field name="subject">form</field><field name="subject">medical</field><field name="subject">ethics</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070914.141825</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Genetic contributors to high density lipoprotein cholesterol levels</field><field name="creator">Slatter, Tania Lee</field><field name="description">Reduced high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) concentrations are a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Intense interest recently has been in identifying the genetic factors that contribute to an aberrant HDL-C phenotype. Finding genetic factors associated with low HDL-C concentrations in New Zealanders was the major aim of this study, with a similar analysis aimed at finding factors associated with high HDL-C concentrations included. The study began with an investigation of a New Zealand family with HDL-C deficiency. The proband had virtually no HDL-C, and was homozygous for an R1068H mutation in the ABCA1 gene. Nineteen relatives were recruited into the study, and an analysis aimed at finding the underlying cause for the disparate HDL-C phenotypes amongst H1068 carriers initiated. 
 A further investigation into HDL-C levels aimed to find other genetic factors that contribute to HDL-C in New Zealanders. Subjects were selected from those taking part in the Otago Vascular Disease study, and placed into three groups based on their HDL-C lipid measurement: low (n=154), mid (n=105), and high (n=102) HDL-C. Mutations in ABCAI and the apolipoprotein AI gene (APOAI) were identified in subjects with low HDL-C. Polymorphisms in ABCA1 and APOAI were also investigated as contributors to HDL-C concentrations. Seventeen SNPs in functionally relevant regions were genotyped in the three HDL-C groups. Five single polymorphisms and one polymorphism haplotype showed a statistically significant association with HDL-C concentrations. 
 The final analysis investigated plasma lipoprotein compositions in individuals with low HDL-C to identify if other lipoprotein abnormalities concurred. Individuals with HDL-C below 0.65 mmol/L were almost invariably associated with triglyceride-rich VLDL and/or triglyceride-rich LDL. This finding may have relevance for an increased atherosclerotic risk for those with low HDL-C.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cholesterol</field><field name="subject">genetic</field><field name="subject">High density lipoproteins</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070914.143900</field></doc><doc><field name="title">For better or for worse ... : a case study analysis of social services partnerships in Aotearoa/New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Walker, Peter E</field><field name="description">Partnerships between organizations are seen as one of the building blocks of the &#65533;Third Way&#65533; approach to welfare provision both in Europe and in New Zealand. While there is much discussion of this emphasis on building social capital and working in partnerships these partnerships are usually perceived as being between government and community or private organizations as part of a new phase of neo-liberalism. Using qualitative research this thesis explores three partnership sites: Those within a Maori social service provider, Te Whanau Arohanui, and the local Hapu and State organisations; that between the Ngai Tahu Maori Law Centre (an indigenous organization) and the Dunedin Community Law Centre; and finally the State lead Strengthening Families partnership initiative. 
 This thesis is concerned with the development of citizen participation in public policy decision-making through partnerships. While contemporary studies of policy change have identified stakeholder and actor-network forms as dominant these often seem even less democratic, participatory, accountable and transparent than those they have supposedly replaced. I draw on ideas of deliberative governance to explore options for both the theory and practice of sustainable, permanent and participatory policy change in an age of diversity. I suggest that the practice of Community Development is needed to supplement descriptive and post-facto accounts of policy change and so create a usable practice theory of effective mechanisms for participatory input. 
 Using a series of case studies of partnerships, a tentative practice theory and strategy for change is proposed. This is set within an interactive framework that is able to confront levels of power to encourage diversity and participation in decision-making from bottom-up initiatives.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Public welfare</field><field name="subject">Dunedin</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">social services</field><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">people</field><field name="subject">social conditions</field><field name="subject">Te Whanau Arohanui Trust</field><field name="subject">Dunedin Community Law Centre</field><field name="subject">Ngai Tahu Maori Law Centre</field><field name="subject">Treaty of Waitangi</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070914.145613</field></doc><doc><field name="title">DDT residue degradation by soil bacteria</field><field name="creator">McDougal, Rebecca</field><field name="description">1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(4-chlorophenyl)-ethane (DDT) residues (DDTr) are widespread and persistent environmental contaminants, and have been classed as priority pollutants by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). DDTr are potent endocrine disrupting molecules, and have been associated with reproductive abnormalities in juvenile alligators and rats. Microorganisms that metabolise DDTr both aerobically and anaerobically have been isolated and characterised. Bacteria that degrade DDTr aerobically typically utilise a dioxygenase to initiate degradative reactions through ring-hydroxylation, and convert DDTr to 4-chlorobenzoate without further degradation. Terrabacter sp. strain DDE-1 was isolated from DDTr-contaminated soil from Canterbury, New Zealand, and aerobically degrades 1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis-(4-chlorophenyl)-ethylene (DDE) to 4-chlorobenzoate, when grown in the presence of biphenyl (BP). The intermediates of degradation were inferred to be the end products of dioxygenase activity. Sequencing of a large linear plasmid, pBPH-1, from strain DDE-1 identified a cluster of genes with high levels of sequence similarity to BP-degradation genes from Rhodococcus spp. and Pseudomonas spp. This plasmid is lost at high frequency producing the plasmid-cured strain MJ-2, which has lost the ability to degrade BP or DDE. The aim of this study was to confirm that DDE-degradation in strain DDE-1 is encoded by the bph operon located on pBPH-1. No genetic systems to study gene function in either DDE-1 or MJ-2 could be developed using an array of broad-host range vectors. However, heterologous expression of the bph genes in Rhodococcus erythropolis strain TA422 was successful, with the recombinant strain TA425, obtaining the ability to utilise BP and DDE as a sole source of carbon and energy. DDE-1 was shown to convert indole to indigo, but MJ-2 could not, indicating that the biphenyl dioxygenase located on pBPH-1 is responsible for this activity. The bph genes from strain DDE-1 also conferred the ability to produce indigo from indole on strain TA425, confirming successful expression of the functional biphenyl dioxygenase in this strain. Despite several attempts to show quantitative degradation in strain TA425 using gas chromatography, the results were inconclusive Further analysis is needed to provide unequivocal evidence of DDE-degradation by strain TA425. Attempts to express the bph genes in rhizosphere-colonising bacteria, such a Rhizobium spp. or Pseudomonas spp., were unsuccessful, as evidenced by the inability to produce indigo, hence the lack of a functional biphenyl dioxygenase. However, RT-PCR did indeed indicate that P. aeruginosa strain Fin1 produced a bphA1 transcript, indicating that an error is occurring post-transcriptionally in these strains, to prevent production of the functional enzyme. 
 New Zealand has recently been shown to contain hotspots of DDTr-contamination. The second aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of DDTr-degrading bacteria and to gain insight into the types of bacteria that inhabit sites contaminated with DDTr. To investigate this, culture-dependent and culture-independent techniques were employed. Enrichment for DDTr-degrading bacteria yielded species of Rhodococcus and Ralstonia using DDTr-overlayer plate assays. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) were used to amplify and analyse the 16S rDNA and 16S rRNA for the identification of dominant and active bacteria in soil samples. The results of this analysis identified bacteria such as Williamsia spp. and Gordonia spp. that degrade other types of pollutants. This analysis did not identify a predominance of Rhodococcus or Ralstonia spp., or other bacteria that have been shown to degrade DDTr. To identify ecologically relevant members of the bacterial communities in DDTr-contaminated soils, and potentially important metabolic pathways, identification of ring-hydroxylating dioxygenase (RHD) genes was performed. PCR and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis were employed together with phylogenetic analyses. The results showed that the RHD genes identified, clustered separately to those genes previously characterised from cultivated bacteria. Among these genes, one phylogenetic group was most closely related to the dioxygenase genes from Ralstonia eutropha H850, which is potent PCB-degrading bacterium that possesses a dioxygenase with a wide substrate range for many types of heavily chlorinated, PCB congeners. The identification of a predominance of genes with similarity to phenyl-propionate dioxygenases has been not been recognised previously in soil studies.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">DDT</field><field name="subject">insecticide</field><field name="subject">dichloroethylene</field><field name="subject">biodegradation</field><field name="subject">biphenyl compounds</field><field name="subject">trichloroethane</field><field name="subject">environmental</field><field name="subject">soil</field><field name="subject">pollution</field><field name="subject">microbiology</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070914.142931</field></doc><doc><field name="title">"He kura Maori, he kura hahi, he kura katorika, he kura motuhake mo te iwi." Hato Paora College : a model of Maori Catholic education</field><field name="creator">Matthews, Nathan W</field><field name="description">Church initiated and operated Maori secondary boarding schools have existed in Aotearoa in various forms since the arrival of the missionaries in the early 19th century. Since their inception, they have contributed significantly to the development of Maori society, particularly in the production of dynamic Maori leaders who have had a compelling influence on their communities, wider Maori society and in some instances on the nation state. This thesis will examine the Society of Mary&#65533;s establishment of Hato Paora College, Feilding, as an example of a Maori Catholic secondary boarding school. 
 The first part contains four general chapters that provide relevant background information to the establishment of Hato Paora. The first identifies key aspects of a Maori Catholic world view and Maori Catholicism. Chapter two traces the arrival, and subsequent development, of the Catholic Church in New Zealand as a mission to Maori. The next chapter looks more specifically at the history of the Society of Mary in New Zealand and the development of the Diocese of Wellington, particularly their Maori missions, under their authority. Finally, Chapter four chronicles the situation of Maori within the New Zealand education system since its inception. 
 Part two of this thesis contains eight chapters that present a detailed case study of Hato Paora. The exploration of the type of educational environment provided by Hato Paora College begins in Chapter six with the examination of its foundation. Chapters seven and eight look at the philosophies and administration of each of the six rectors. The two succeeding chapters describe the defining characteristics of the school, its Maori character and its Catholic character. Chapter eleven evaluates how this school has influenced the boys who attended, using interviews with a representative sampling of old boys. Chapter twelve concerns the relationships that the College early established with the Maori communities that it belongs to.

The concentration of nitric oxide in exhaled air (FENO) correlates with the degree of eosinophilic airway inflammation and has been proposed as a new breath test to assist in the management of asthma. 
 Key Aims: To determine the predictive accuracy of FENO compared with conventional testing in the diagnosis of asthma. 
 To assess the performance characteristics of FENO to predict steroid responsiveness compared with the conventional approach in patients presenting with non-specific respiratory symptoms. 
 To assess the role of FENO compared with conventional guidelines-based approach as a guide to adjusting inhaled corticosteroid therapy in patients with chronic persistent asthma. 
 Methods: Consecutive patients referred with chronic undiagnosed respiratory symptoms were enrolled. Comparisons were made between FENO, induced sputum analysis and other conventional tests (including peak flow variation, spirometry, response to oral steroid challenge) for predicting the presence of asthma in the first study, and for predicting response to four weeks inhaled fluticasone treatment in the second study. 
 In the third study, 110 subjects with chronic persistent asthma were enrolled into a single-blind placebo-controlled study during which subjects were randomly allocated to have their corticosteroid (fluticasone) dose adjusted on the basis of either FENO measurements or an algorithm based on conventional guidelines. The main outcomes were the frequency of asthma exacerbations and the mean daily dose of inhaled corticosteroid. 
 Results: In the first study, 17 of 47 consecutive patients were diagnosed with asthma. Sensitivities for the conventional tests (0-47%) were lower than for FENO (88%) and sputum eosinophils (86%), with overall significantly greater diagnostic accuracy for FENO and sputum eosinophils. 
 Fifty-two consecutive subjects completed the second study. When compared to the conventional tests, the predictive powers for FENO were consistently greater than for almost all other baseline measurements used to predict steroid responsiveness, with an optimum cut point of 47 ppb. 
 In the third study, the exacerbation rates were 0.49 (95% C.I. 0.20, 0.78) per patient per year in the FENO group and 0.90 (95% C.I. 0.31, 1.49) in the control group, representing a nonsignificant reduction of 45.6 percent (95% C.I. -78.5, 54.5%) in the FENO group. The final mean daily doses of fluticasone were significantly lower in for the FENO group compared with the conventional group (370 [mu]g/day (95% C.I. 263, 477) vs 641 [mu]g/day (95% C.I. 526, 756) respectively; p=0.003). There were no significant differences in other markers of asthma control, use of oral prednisone, pulmonary function, or levels of airway inflammation (sputum eosinophils). 
 Conclusions: FENO is comparable to induced sputum analysis and superior to the conventional methods currently used including peak flows and spirometry as a dignositic for asthma and as a predictor of steroid responsiveness in patients with chronic respiratory symptoms. FENO measurements as a guide to adjusting inhaled corticosteroid therapy compared to the conventional guidelines based approach results in significantly lower maintenance doses being achieved without compromising asthma control. The results of this thesis provide evidence to support the use of FENO measurements in routine clinical practice as a tool to improve the overall management and diagnosis of asthma.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Nitric oxide</field><field name="subject">respiration</field><field name="subject">asthma</field><field name="subject">diagnosis</field><field name="subject">measurement</field><field name="subject">treatment</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070924.133734</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modelling and spectroscopy of polypyridyl and porphyrin complexes for electroluminescence and solar cell applications</field><field name="creator">Walsh, Penelope Jane</field><field name="description">This thesis reports the spectroscopic and computational studies of two classes of compounds, which have applications in new optoelectronic materials technology. Substituted ligands of dipyrido-[3,2a:2&#65533;,3&#65533;c]phenazine (dppz), and their Cu(I), Re(I) and Ru(II) complexes have utility in organic electroluminescent devices. A series of Zn(II) tetraphenylporphyrins with conjugated functional groups at the &#946;-position have been used with success in liquid heterojunction dye-sensitized solar cells. The vibrational spectra and optoelectronic properties of the two classes were investigated using Raman, resonance Raman and transient resonance Raman spectroscopy, in conjunction with density functional theory methods. 
 Density functional theory frequency calculations were used to aid vibrational mode assignments for the dppz compounds, and show close agreement with the experimental non-resonance Raman spectra. The enhancement of modes which are localized on differing sections of the ligand was identified. The nature of the absorbing chromophores for the dppz ligands and complexes was established using resonance Raman spectroscopy in concert with vibrational assignments from calculations. Transient resonance Raman spectra of the ligands provided spectral signatures for the triplet ligand-centred state; these features were observed in the TR&#65533; spectra of the metal complexes, along with other features attributable to MLCT states. 
 Electroluminescent devices were fabricated using the dppz ligands and complexes as emissive dopants, and their properties investigated. The optoelectronic behaviour of the devices was found to be influenced by the mechanism of exciton formation on the dopant. The device properties were also dependent on the dopant concentration, the concentrations of other components and the driving voltage. 
 The electronic structure of the porphyrin compounds was investigated using time-dependent density functional theory methods. Comparison of calculated optical transitions with experimental data shows that the calculations predict trends in the optical absorption spectra with change of functional group and with increase in conjugation chain length. The calculations suggest that the electron-withdrawing substituent decreases the configuration interaction effect by breaking the degeneracy of the two lowest unoccupied MOs, and other configuration interaction effects come into play involving other frontier MOs. Interrupting the conjugation of the functional group is shown to mitigate the breakdown of the configuration interaction. 
 The perturbation of the normal electronic structure of the porphyrin by the substituent was also investigated using resonance Raman spectroscopy. Vibrational analysis identified bands due to the substituent, implying coupling between the porphyrin and substituent chromophores. Changes in frequency of porphyrin core modes due to the differing substituents and different metal centres were reproduced by density functional theory calculations. 
 This project has allowed the spectroscopic investigation of the active optical states in a number of polypyridyl and porphyrin compounds, and determined the efficacy of DFT and TDDFT calculations to predict the properties of these compounds.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Porphyrins</field><field name="subject">spectra</field><field name="subject">electroluminescence</field><field name="subject">solar cells</field><field name="subject">spectrum analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070927.151236</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A consumer-oriented view of quality : an exploratory study of quality in the context of marketing&#65533;s scholarly articles</field><field name="creator">Rosenstreich, Daniela</field><field name="description">Current models of quality in the marketing discipline tend to have a producer orientation. Influences on quality outside the control of the firm, such as consumer perceptions or needs, are only addressed in a rudimentary manner. While quality is acknowledged as being determined by the consumer and akin to an attitude, ironically, literature on quality is not well grounded in relevant theory from psychology and related disciplines. 
 This thesis presents an exploration of quality and its meaning within the context of assessing scholarly marketing articles. The objective of the study is to develop a new consumer- oriented model of quality to enhance understanding of the construct, enabling marketers to better influence consumers&#65533; assessment of quality. 
 The academic marketplace involves articulate and experienced producers, channel members and consumers. An investigation of quality within the context of marketing&#65533;s scholarly articles therefore provides rich material for refining the quality construct. The first stage of the research addressed two research questions related to scholarly articles: RQ1: What intrinsic factors (article attributes) influence quality assessments? RQ2: What extrinsic factors (external to the article) influence quality assessments? 
 The components of quality in scholarly articles were drawn from several sources: literature sources; journal editorial policies; key informant interviews; and analysis of the content and editorial boards of the top journals. Overall, results suggested a connection between consumers&#65533; assessments of quality and factors such as their belief structures, reference group norms, and consumption context. 
 The empirical findings led to further investigation through literature analysis. Theories from psychology helped to explain the interplay of beliefs, attitudes and perceptions in quality assessments and suggest consumer characteristics (such as the rigidity of mental sets, or novelty seeking behaviour) that influence that interplay. 
 On a theoretical level, the new quality model integrates theories of psychology with product-oriented aspects providing a multifaceted view of the quality construct. This is achieved by using the Theory of Planned Behaviour as the central framework, providing a robust depiction of quality assessment from a consumer perspective. Elements of quality from managerial models, such as product attributes and company image, are found to fit logically into the new structure. The new model also reveals connections with the philosophy and sociology of science and provides an enhanced understanding of the workings of academia and the dissemination of scholarly knowledge. 
 There has previously been no comprehensive study of quality in academic articles, therefore on a practical level the model of quality supports authors in producing improved manuscripts, thus enabling faster review and dissemination of research within the discipline. Further research to refine and test the model is recommended.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Quality</field><field name="subject">products</field><field name="subject">marketing</field><field name="subject">literature</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070928.160805</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Soft-sediment benthos of Aramoana and Blueskin Bay (Otago, New Zealand) and effects of dredge-spoil disposal</field><field name="creator">Paavo, Brian Lee</field><field name="description">Studies were conducted to broadly describe and understand the sediment benthos of a shallow-water coastal area (Aramoana Beach - Heyward Point - Blueskin Bay) near the entrance to Otago Harbour, a system largely representative for southeastern New Zealand. Benthic assemblages were examined in relation to gradients of wave exposure and disturbance, sediment type and bathymetry, and dredge-spoil disposal. 
 Sediment and macrofaunal surveys in autumn and spring 2003 found little change in sediment texture gradients from historical studies and a lack of vertical stratification. Macrobenthic samples from spring produced significantly higher abundances of three numerically dominant phyla (Arthropoda, Annelida, and Mollusca) and higher taxon richness compared to autumn. Within water depths of 6-30 m, abundance, richness, and diversity increased with depth. Multivariate analyses identified similar assemblages among deeper sites, despite sediment textural differences, whereas distinct assemblages were found in the shallow portions of the three areas. Meiofaunal abundance patterns did not reflect those of macrofauna, possibly indicating greater vertical penetration of sediments in these hydrodynamic environments. Several new kinorhynch taxa were found. 
 In a field manipulation, part of the Aramoana dredge-spoil dumpground was protected from spoil disposal for an extended period followed by experimental dumping of sandy and muddy spoil. Macrofaunal samples were collected before dumping and at nine sites &lt; 119 d after disposal. Water velocities at the sediment-water interface were compared to a local sediment disturbance model. Dumpground samples were depauperate in individuals and taxa compared to an area protected from dumping for &gt; 180 d. A drop in abundance and a dissimilar community coincided with muddy spoil, but fine sediments were dispersed within 26 d and macrofaunal assemblages recovered to the pre-existing state. Sandy spoil, while not altering native sediment textures, had a more prolonged impact due to transplantation of macrofauna from the dredged area that persisted for &lt; 41 d after disposal. Side-scan sonar mapping indicated that the disposal footprint model used approximated the extent of sandy spoil impacts well, while local conditions spread muddy sediments beyond the initial impact site. 
 A novel sediment profile imaging device was constructed that has many advantages over existing devices for spoil mound studies and habitat mapping: it is smaller, can be manually deployed from small boats, is cheaper, and can be modified to work in almost any soft sediment. 
 Studies of one dominant taxon, the gastropod Zethalia zelandica, showed it was better able to survive sand burial than mud burial, did not vary in overall activity through a range of 5-14&#65533; C, and contributed a large proportion of biomass of its community. 
 The spoil disposal strategy used does not appear as environmentally neutral as originally thought. Only muds are effectively dispersed whereas coarser sediments accumulate, affecting physical and biological benthic processes of a wider area. Two mitigation strategies were evaluated using a heuristic model. Reducing the disposal area and spreading mud disposal events over a longer time span may be an effective interim strategy. Overall, the studies will help guide management of the area.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Benthos</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Blueskin Bay</field><field name="subject">Aramoana</field><field name="subject">marine</field><field name="subject">ecology</field><field name="subject">Otago Harbour</field><field name="subject">dredging</field><field name="subject">spoil</field><field name="subject">environmental</field><field name="subject">waste</field><field name="subject">disposal</field><field name="subject">ocean</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070928.161657</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Power, control and accountability in a voluntary organisation : the implications for professional staff and service delivery</field><field name="creator">Favell, Margaret Elizabeth</field><field name="description">Over the last decade government policy has transformed many aspects of the welfare state and contracted out to private or voluntary non-government organisations many of the services previously provided by the state. Currently there is very little research on the benefits or disadvantages regarding standards of professional practice and delivery of these services when controlled by voluntary organisations and this research is a case study investigating these concerns. 
 By using the case study method it is possible to understand issues by incorporating concrete examples of practice within the context that it takes place, as it is only when seen in its proper setting that the general and conceptual significance of practice is understood. 
 This case study explores the relationships of power, control and accountability in one such non-governmental organisation, the Royal New Zealand Plunket Society and the implications these have for professional staff in the delivery of the service. The study uses the archaeology and genealogy methods suggested by Foucault. Archival material was gained from the Minutes of the meetings of the Plunket executive (1917-1984), constitution and rules. These serve to demonstrate the historical power relationships in the organisation, Plunket nurses&#65533; working conditions and how some nurses were treated. The dominant discourse in the archaeology contains two major themes, one being volunteers&#65533; autonomous 'ownership' of the organisation, and the other, the subordination of professionalism through the discipline and management of the nursing workforce. 
 Those same themes are also dominant in the contemporary data studied in the genealogy, which highlights the constraints imposed by volunteer 'ownership' in the contemporary period. It is a feature of the "path dependency" of the organisation that the belief that volunteers had a right to discipline and control the nursing workforce has remained largely unchanged in the contemporary period. 
 The practice and the context are personalised through interviews with some nurses so that their real-life experiences may give an in-depth understanding of the processes going on for them as professionals. This is one of multiple sources of evidence, including reports, reviews and research, used to triangulate the findings. Through the totality of these methods, insight into Plunket&#65533;s decision-making is made possible. 
 These serve to underline the continuing lack of accountability for service delivery of nonprofessional 'owners' of the voluntary organisation and the negative impact it can have on the delivery of professional services although the greater depth in the contemporary data also highlights two new subsidiary themes; the dominance of lay knowledge over both professional and managerial knowledge, and volunteers&#65533; motives for volunteering. 
 The contemporary interview data demonstrated how the historical culture of the organisation enabled this process to continue through poor workplace conditions, high staff attrition and, in some cases, severe personal pressure akin to workplace bullying. 
 This study exposes the significance of the culture of organisations, and reveals that the substance of apparent altruistic voluntary organisations may be much more complex and problematic than the ideology would lead us to believe. In a field such as this, where an NGO has sole national responsibility for such an important area and where the outcomes are so poor, change must be considered. While a path dependency explanation is pessimistic about change, it is argued that the only option for professional standards of service for this, and other NGOs, lies in much more accountability and democracy in stakeholder relationships. Recommendations are made in that direction.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Great Britain</field><field name="subject">voluntarism</field><field name="subject">management</field><field name="subject">community</field><field name="subject">health</field><field name="subject">services</field><field name="subject">children</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">corporate</field><field name="subject">culture</field><field name="subject">associations</field><field name="subject">institutions</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20071003.101609</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ovarian steroid hormone effects on prolactin secretion in the late pregnant rat</field><field name="creator">Steyn, Frederik Jacobus</field><field name="description">Under normal circumstances, prolactin regulates its own release via a short-loop negative feedback mechanism in which prolactin, secreted from lactotrophs situated within the anterior pituitary gland, stimulates dopaminergic neurons in the hypothalamus to release dopamine into portal blood circulation. Dopamine, in turn, inhibits lactotroph activity. A change in this regulation of prolactin secretion is seen during late pregnancy where tuberoinfundibular dopaminergic (TIDA) neurons no longer respond to elevated levels of placental lactogen (PL), a lactogen structurally and functionally similar to prolactin, allowing a prolonged elevation of prolactin secretion and the induction of an antepartum prolactin surge (Andrews et al., 2001). The mechanisms behind this loss of responsiveness have not yet been determined. 
 Prolactin acts by binding to its receptor on TIDA neurons and activating the signal transducer and activator of transcription 5b (STAT5b). During lactation, prolactin-induced activation of STAT5b is suppressed. This reduction in STAT5b signalling is consistent with a loss in TIDA responsiveness and is correlated with an increase in suppressor of cytokine signalling (SOCS) messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) expression within the arcuate nucleus. As SOCS proteins are known to disrupt prolactin signalling by interfering with STAT signalling in other systems, it is likely that the change in TIDA responsiveness to prolactin or PL during late pregnancy occurs at least partially in response to an increase in SOCS proteins at this time. Although prolactin can induce SOCS mRNA expression within the arcuate nucleus, the level of SOCS mRNA expression observed on day 20 of pregnancy is significantly lower to that observed on day 22. As PL is elevated on day 20 of pregnancy, some other factor or a combination of factors unique to the final 2 days of pregnancy induces the change in prolactin signalling. Late pregnancy is associated with elevated levels of estrogen while progesterone significantly declines. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that a fall in progesterone in the presence of elevated levels of estrogen during late pregnancy induces the increase in SOCS levels within TIDA neurons. This then results in a disruption of prolactin signalling, a decline in dopamine production and release, and the induction of the antepartum prolactin surge. 
 To determine if ovarian steroid hormones can act directly on TIDA neurons during late pregnancy, expression of progesterone receptors (PR) and estrogen receptors (ER) within TIDA neurons were examined during pregnancy and lactation. Using double-labelled immunohistochemistry, expression of both steroid receptors within arcuate dopaminergic neurons during pregnancy and lactation was confirmed. This is consistent with the hypothesis that changing levels of steroid hormones might directly regulate TIDA activity. Furthermore, as the level of steroid receptor expression within TIDA neurons did not change significantly during pregnancy and lactation, it is likely that changing levels of serum estrogen and progesterone may affect these neurons at this time. 
 To investigate the potential effects of steroid hormones on prolactin-induced and non prolactin-induced expression of SOCS mRNA, ovariectomised rats were treated with bromocriptine to suppress endogenous prolactin, and were then treated with a regime of chronic progesterone and/or estrogen in the presence and absence of an induced prolactin surge. SOCS mRNA expression within the arcuate nucleus was measured using real time quantitative RT-PCR. It was found that both estrogen and prolactin independently induced SOCS mRNA expression within the arcuate nucleus, but high levels of progesterone inhibited this effect. This supported the hypothesis that a change in SOCS mRNA expression within TIDA neurons might occur following the changes in steroid hormone levels observed during late pregnancy. 
 To specifically investigate the role of estrogen and progesterone in regulating SOCS expression during late pregnancy, an animal model was designed to experimentally alter estrogen and progesterone levels during late pregnancy, and then SOCS mRNA expression was examined. In this model, advancing the late pregnant decline in progesterone resulted in a significant advance in the timing of the antepartum prolactin surge and parturition, while delaying the decline in progesterone abolished the antepartum prolactin surge and delayed parturition. Furthermore, within this model, elevated levels of SOCS mRNA expression were always observed following the withdrawal of progesterone. This suggested that following the decline in progesterone during late pregnancy, elevated levels of estrogen (or PL) are able to induce SOCS mRNA expression within the arcuate nucleus. Given that SOCS proteins disrupt cytokine signalling in other systems, the induction of SOCS proteins during late pregnancy would then presumably mediate the change in TIDA responsiveness to prolactin. 
 To determine whether it was possible to change prolactin responses without affecting parturition, it was hoped to specifically alter progesterone and estrogen signalling in the brain. This was done by centrally administering progesterone to maintain progesterone levels during late pregnancy, and the ER antagonist ICI-182,780 (ICI) to block central estrogen levels. To determine the effectiveness of intracerebroventricular (icv) administration of ICI, two central estrogen mediated endpoints were evaluated: estrogen negative feedback on gonadotrophin releasing hormone (GnRH) pulse frequency (as measured by the frequency luteinizing hormone (LH) pulses) and the induction of PR within hypothalamic nuclei. Also, to confirm that central administration of ICI did not have a peripheral effect, estrogen induced uterine proliferation was measured. Although central ICI administration at the maximum possible dose affected estrogen-induced GnRH pulse frequency and partially reduced estrogen-induced PR expression within arcuate dopaminergic neurons, ICI did not affect the antepartum prolactin surge. Furthermore, cental administration of progesterone did not abolish the antepartum prolactin surge. This suggested that central administration of ICI and progesterone as a tool for researching central actions of ovarian steroids is likely to be limited to certain central endpoints, and was not suitable as a model to study central steroid effects on prolactin regulation. 
 Overall, the progression of the findings in this study led to the formulation of a key hypothesis: that during late pregnancy, elevated levels of estrogen and the withdrawal of progesterone allows for the prolactin-induced increase of SOCS proteins within TIDA neurons. Elevated levels of SOCS proteins may then disrupt normal prolactin signalling, mediated via the JAK/STAT pathway. This results in reduced dopamine synthesis and release and, the subsequent induction of the antepartum prolactin surge.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Prolactin</field><field name="subject">secretion</field><field name="subject">pregnancy</field><field name="subject">physiological</field><field name="subject">lactation</field><field name="subject">metabolism</field><field name="subject">rats</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20071008.115829</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Bayesian statistical models for predicting software effort using small datasets</field><field name="creator">Van Koten, Chikako</field><field name="description">The need of today&#65533;s society for new technology has resulted in the development of a growing number of software systems. Developing a software system is a complex endeavour that requires a large amount of time. This amount of time is referred to as software development effort. Software development effort is the sum of hours spent by all individuals involved. Therefore, it is not equal to the duration of the development. 
 Accurate prediction of the effort at an early stage of development is an important factor in the successful completion of a software system, since it enables the developing organization to allocate and manage their resource effectively. However, for many software systems, accurately predicting the effort is a challenge. Hence, a model that assists in the prediction is of active interest to software practitioners and researchers alike. 
 Software development effort varies depending on many variables that are specific to the system, its developmental environment and the organization in which it is being developed. An accurate model for predicting software development effort can often be built specifically for the target system and its developmental environment. A local dataset of similar systems to the target system, developed in a similar environment, is then used to calibrate the model. 
 However, such a dataset often consists of fewer than 10 software systems, causing a serious problem in the prediction, since predictive accuracy of existing models deteriorates as the size of the dataset decreases. 
 This research addressed this problem with a new approach using Bayesian statistics. This particular approach was chosen, since the predictive accuracy of a Bayesian statistical model is not so dependent on a large dataset as other models. As the size of the dataset decreases to fewer than 10 software systems, the accuracy deterioration of the model is expected to be less than that of existing models. The Bayesian statistical model can also provide additional information useful for predicting software development effort, because it is also capable of selecting important variables from multiple candidates. In addition, it is parametric and produces an uncertainty estimate. 
 This research developed new Bayesian statistical models for predicting software development effort. Their predictive accuracy was then evaluated in four case studies using different datasets, and compared with other models applicable to the same small dataset. 
 The results have confirmed that the best new models are not only accurate but also consistently more accurate than their regression counterpart, when calibrated with fewer than 10 systems. They can thus replace the regression model when using small datasets. Furthermore, one case study has shown that the best new models are more accurate than a simple model that predicts the effort by calculating the average value of the calibration data. Two case studies has also indicated that the best new models can be more accurate for some software systems than a case-based reasoning model. 
 Since the case studies provided sufficient empirical evidence that the new models are generally more accurate than existing models compared, in the case of small datasets, this research has produced a methodology for predicting software development effort using the new models.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bayesian statistical decision theory</field><field name="subject">computer</field><field name="subject">software</field><field name="subject">development</field><field name="subject">mathematical</field><field name="subject">models</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20071009.120134</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The development of an occupational health and safety surveillance tool for New Zealand workers</field><field name="creator">Lilley, Rebbecca Catherine</field><field name="description">World-wide, working life is undergoing major changes. Established market economies are increasingly characterised by demands for vastly greater market flexibility. New Zealand (NZ) has been no different with rapid changes occurring over the last 2 decades in the organisation of labour, of work and of the work environment. Recent international research suggests that work change significantly impacts upon worker health and safety. 
 Many OECD nations undertake routine cross-sectional surveys to monitor changes in working conditions and environments, assessing the health and safety impact of these changes. Similar monitoring is not undertaken in NZ, with the impact of the work environment on health and injury outcomes poorly understood. This lack of knowledge (monitoring) is considered to be a significant impediment to the progression of health and safety initiatives in NZ. 
 The aim of this thesis was to develop a tool (questionnaire) and methodology suitable for use in the surveillance of working conditions, work environments and health and injury outcomes using workers&#65533; surveys. The survey development was undertaken in 3 phases: i) development of tool through critical review; ii) empirical methodological testing and iii) an empirical validation study. 
 Questionnaire development was a stepwise process of content selection. Firstly key dimensional themes were identified via critical review of literature and existing international surveys leading to the establishment of a dimensional framework. Secondly a critical review of questions to measure key dimensions based upon selection criteria occurred. Finally the selected questions and design were pre-tested before piloting. A similar development process was undertaken for the development of a calendar collecting occupational histories. 
 A methodological study was undertaken piloting the questionnaire. Two methods of data collection were evaluated: face-to-face and telephone interviews, and two methods of occupational history collection: calendar and question set. Telephone interviewing was found to be the more efficient and effective data collection method while occupational history collection was found to be less time consuming by question set. Focus groups indicated questions were acceptable and suitable to NZ workers. 
 A validation study was undertaken with a cross-sectional study in distinctly different occupational groups: cleaners and clerical workers. Comparisons were made between the groups with cleaners expected to be identified as employed under more hazardous working conditions and be exposed to more hazards of a physical nature, while clerical workers were expected to be exposed to more psychological hazards of a psychological nature. Results indicated the questionnaire provides data capable of making valid comparisons, identifying work patterns of high risk and provides good predictive validity. 
 The final survey has the potential to generate population data on a wide range of work-related exposure and health variables relevant to contemporary working life. The survey results will contribute to understanding the range of working conditions and work environments NZ workers are currently exposed to and to assessing the health and safety impact of these exposures. Therefore it is recommended this tool initially be used in a national workforce survey to establish baseline surveillance data of working conditions, work environments and health and safety outcomes in NZ.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Industrial</field><field name="subject">safety</field><field name="subject">auditing</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">evaluation</field><field name="subject">work</field><field name="subject">environment</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20071011.112802</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Domoic acid-induced cardiac damage : an in vitro and in vivo investigation</field><field name="creator">Vranyac-Tramoundanas, Alexandra</field><field name="description">Cardiovascular pathology is seen in both animals and humans after domoic acid intoxication. Whether this damage is direct (i.e., cardiotoxic) or indirect (i.e., CNS/autonomic seizures) is not known. We have previously shown that acute in vitro domoic acid (0.05-0.25[mu]M; 10 min) treatment of isolated cardiac mitochondria compromises mitochondrial FADH and NAD&#8314;-linked respiratory control and mitochondrial energetics. Domoic acid was shown to traverse and bind the cellular membrane of H9c2 cardiac myoblasts. However it did not compromise cellular viability as assessed using cell quantification or lactate dehydrogenase leakage assays. Exposure of intact H9c2 cells to domoic acid only resulted in complex II-III activity impairment and assessment of reactive oxygen species (superoxide and hydrogen peroxide) production in both isolated cardiac mitochondria and H9c2 cardiomyocytes failed to show any significant differences following exposure to domoic acid. Acute ex vivo domoic acid treatment of an isolated myocardium in Langendorff perfusion mode failed to result in cardiac haemodynamic dysfunction, however there appeared to be small but significant decrease in mitochondrial oxygen utilization. The absence of any substantial damage to intact cardiomyocytes and isolated myocardium suggested that domoic acid does not have a direct toxicological effect on cardiac energetics. We therefore investigated the possibility that cardiovascular pathology is an indirect consequence of autonomic seizure activity. Domoic acid was administered intraperitoneally or intrahippocampally and the development of cardiac pathologies was assessed and compared. Sprague-Dawley rats receiving either i.p. or i.h. domoic acid were assessed behaviourally and shown to reach similar levels in their cumulative seizure scores. 
 Assessment of the cardiac haemodynamics (LVDP, dP/dt, heart rate and coronary flow) revealed a significant time-dependent decrease in function at 1, 3, 7 &amp; 14-days post-i.p. and 7 &amp; 14-days post-i.h. domoic acid administration. Measurement of ventricular mitochondrial oxygen utilization revealed a similar time-dependent decrease in respiratory control, which appeared to be associated with increased proton leakage, shown by an increase in state-4 respiration rate (P&lt;0.01). Assessment of the mitochondrial electron transport chain (complexes I-V) and the mitochondrial marker of integrity, citrate synthase, showed marked time-dependent impairment in both models of domoic acid -induced seizures. Oxidative stress did play a small role in the myocardial damage as indicated by the small decrease in aconitase activity (P&lt;0.05). Plasma IL-1&#945;, IL-1&#946; and TNF-&#945; levels were significantly increased from 3-days post seizures. Haematoxylin &amp; Eosin staining of ventricular sections revealed the formation of contraction bands, inflammation and oedema, confirming a structural pathology. Cardiac damage did not differ between i.p. and i.h. animals, suggesting cardiac damage following domoic acid results from CNS autonomic seizures and resultant sympathetic storm. 
 This thesis has demonstrated, for the first time, that the cardiac pathology seen following domoic acid exposure is most likely to be a result of CNS activation and resultant seizure episodes, and is not a consequence of the direct interaction between domoic acid and the myocardium. We have also demonstrated for the first time, that seizure episodes result in chronic cardiac dysfunction and a structural pathology which is similar, but not identical to that seen following isoprotenerol administration in vivo.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Domoic acid</field><field name="subject">toxicology</field><field name="subject">heart</field><field name="subject">diseases</field><field name="subject">etiology</field><field name="subject">convulsions</field><field name="subject">cardiovascular system</field><field name="subject">pathophysiology</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20071012.143651</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Maintenance of interventions in organisations</field><field name="creator">Mullen, Nadia</field><field name="description">Many successful interventions are not maintained after researchers leave an organisation at the conclusion of a study. This research was conducted to assess the magnitude of this problem and determine which variables affect intervention maintenance. Maintenance was examined in a review and analysis of 125 applicable studies published in the Journal of Organizational Behavior Management from 1977 - 1999. Where necessary, authors of studies were contacted to determine the maintenance status of their intervention. The analysis found the extent of this problem in published studies is substantial. Intervention maintenance was necessary to maintain the intervention&#65533;s effects in two thirds of studies with successful interventions. Of all studies where maintenance was necessary, approximately 40% failed to maintain the intervention. The maintenance procedures derived from the literature, researchers in the field, and journal analysis included planning for a wide range of positive outcomes, designing the intervention to be long-term, and communicating the benefits of the intervention to the organisation. For this thesis, three studies were conducted to examine the effectiveness of these maintenance procedures. The first two studies partially replicated studies where the interventions had been successful but not maintained, with the inclusion of maintenance procedures. Intervention maintenance occurred in a university cafeteria in Study 1, and in one of three supermarkets in Study 2. Study 3 improved on the design and procedure of Study 2, including a manipulation of the maintenance procedures. During intervention in the control supermarket, signs designed to increase customer donations to the supermarket foodbank bin were placed on shelves near discounted items. In the experimental supermarket, both maintenance procedures and signs were used. During 6 weeks of follow-up, the signs were maintained in both supermarkets. The researcher then ceased regular observations, returning only for 1 month, 2 month, and 1 year follow-ups. After researcher presence was withdrawn, maintenance of the signs continued only in the experimental supermarket. This study demonstrates that the maintenance procedures were effective, and necessary, for long-term maintenance to occur after the researcher left the organisation. It was concluded that the maintenance procedures were effective for encouraging intervention maintenance, and recommended that researchers incorporate the procedures into their studies when maintenance is desirable.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Organizational behavior</field><field name="subject">behavior modification</field><field name="subject">charity</field><field name="subject">evaluation</field><field name="subject">case studies</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20071015.160435</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Predictors of physical activity participation during adolescence and young adulthood</field><field name="creator">Richards, Rosalina</field><field name="description">Participation in physical activity is beneficial for multiple health outcomes, however, substantial work remains to improve understanding and promotion of this complex behaviour. Longitudinal studies offer unique insights into physical activity, as they allow examination of how participation, and the factors that are associated with participation, may change during the life-span. 
 This thesis was based on data from the Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health and Development Study (DMHDS). The DMHDS is a birth cohort of around 1000 individuals, born in Dunedin, New Zealand between April 1972 and March 1973. Included in the three studies presented here was information obtained during assessments at birth and ages 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 18,21 and 26 years. 
 Study 1 examined tracking of participation in club sport from childhood to adulthood (7, 9, 15, 18 and 21 years). Correlation coefficients revealed low tracking (r = 0.07-0.28) of club sport participation. Summary statistics, which utilised all the longitudinal data and controlled for the influence of covariates, differed slightly with random effect models finding low tracking (Intraclass correlation coefficient: 0.23) and generalized estimating equations suggesting moderate tracking (Stability coefficient: 0.59). These findings suggest that benefits accrue from early physical activity participation for later participation. However, as tracking is only at low to moderate levels, childhood participation in physical activity should not be considered an 'inoculation' against adult inactivity. 
 Study 2 examined associations between childhood factors (Family socioeconomic status, Family Active Recreation Orientation, Home activities, Childhood motor ability, Intelligence and Psychiatric disorder), contemporaneous factors (Parental health, Body Mass Index, VO&#8322;max, General health, Television watching, Tobacco smoking and Alcohol use) and patterns of Persistent Inactivity, Declining participation and Persistent Activity between ages 15 and 18 years (assessed using the Minnesota Leisure Time Physical Activity Questionnaire). Common childhood influences included Family socioeconomic status, Family Active Recreation Orientation, Home activities and Childhood motor ability. Contemporaneous measures that were associated with patterns of participation included Parental health, General health, VO&#8322;max and Television viewing. 
 Study 3 built on the the findings of Study 2 by investigating if factors associated with adolescent physical activity continued to influence physical activity in adulthood. With the exception of Parental health, all the factors that had been associated with adolescent patterns of physical activity were associated with non-participation in vigorous physical activity during at least one of the two adult assessments (age 21 and 26 years). Common influences for the two ages included participation in Home activities during childhood, Childhood motor ability and Persistent Inactivity during adolescence. 
 In conclusion, the series of studies presented here provides valuable insights into patterns of physical activity from childhood to adulthood and the factors that are associated with these patterns among the DMHDS cohort. Previous findings are extended through the use of a broad range of covariates and independent variables across childhood, adolescence and adulthood. Key findings include the exploration of different techniques to describe tracking across the lifespan and the identification of factors that can usefully be targeted in early intervention programmes to support later physical activity.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Teenagers</field><field name="subject">attitudes</field><field name="subject">youth</field><field name="subject">exercise</field><field name="subject">physical education</field><field name="subject">training</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20071019.133107</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Pheromones, prolactin and maternal behavior : (male pheromones initiate prolactin-induced neurogenesis, decrease anxiety and advance maternal behavior in virgin female mice)</field><field name="creator">Larsen, Caroline</field><field name="description">Maternal behavior in rodents is dependent, at least in part, on prolactin acting in the brain. Pheromones carried by male mouse major urinary proteins lower serum prolactin levels in female mice. Therefore, we hypothesized that virgin female C57BL/6J mice housed in split cages, where they had pheromonal but not physical contact with a male, would show suppressed maternal behavior. Contrary to our hypothesis, we found split-cage housed females were significantly faster to retrieve 3 foster pups on the first and second day of maternal behavior testing compared to mice housed in individual cages. The advancement in maternal behavior was replicated when virgin females were simply exposed to male mouse urine-soaked bedding. Ovariectomising the mice, to remove the influence of steroid hormones, prior to placement in the split cages, prevented the pheromonal advancement of maternal behavior. The data infer that an ovarian steroid-dependent action of male mouse pheromones primes virgin female mice to express maternal behavior more rapidly when mouse pups are introduced. 
 This effect required greater than 14 days exposure to male pheromones. Male mouse pheromones are reported to suppress prolactin secretion. However, serum prolactin levels in split-caged housed females, where they had pheromonal but not physical contact with a male, were only briefly lowered and became significantly elevated from 24 hours until 72 hours of pheromonal contact. Despite the early increases in prolactin after pheromone exposure, levels were significantly lower in the pheromone-exposed females when maternal behavior was tested after 21 days. It has been previously reported that prolactin is important in the onset of maternal behavior, but is not required for the ongoing maintenance of maternal behavior. We hypothesised that the hyperprolactinemia observed in the first 24-72 hours of pheromonai exposure had subsequently led to the enhanced maternal behavior. To test this we injected a group of individually-housed mice with slow release prolactin for 48 hours to simulate the period of hyperprolactinemia, and blocked prolactin secretion in a group of split-caged housed females with bromocriptine, and tested their maternal behavior 18 days later. The mice injected with prolactin had enhanced maternal behavior, compared to controls injected with a placebo. By contrast, bromocriptine inhibition of prolactin secretion completely prevented the pheromonal enhancement of maternal behavior. This suggests that the pheromonal advancement of maternal behavior is specifically mediated by a 48-hour period of sustained hyperprolactinemia. 
 It has been previously shown that pregnancy increases neurogenesis in the subventricular zone in a prolactin-dependent manner. Therefore, as the male pheromone-induced advancement of maternal behavior is prolactin-dependent and takes some time to occur, we hypothesized that long-term pheromonal contact initiates mitogenesis in the subventricular zone. Split-caged housed mice showed a significant increase in BrdU-labeled cells in the subventricular zone after 7 days of contact which reduced to baseline levels by 14 days of contact. The mice injected with BrdU on day 7 of contact and killed 21 days later showed a significant increase in labeled cells in the accessory olfactory bulb compared to controls. The data suggest that male mouse pheromones initiate mitogenesis in the subventricular zone of virgin C57B6 mice, in an exposure-dependent manner, and that these cells travel via the rostral migratory stream to the accessory olfactory bulb. As with the effect on maternal behavior, the pheromone-induced increase in neurogenesis was steroid- and prolactin-dependent. 
 During pregnancy and lactation in rodents, prolactin receptor expression is increased in the MPOA, an adaptive change, which could lead to an increased neuronal response to serum prolactin levels, which are high just prior to parturition, and consequently could underlie the enhanced maternal responses seen in late pregnancy and after parturition. It is known that systemic prolactin can access the brain, but it is also possible that there could be local synthesis of brain prolactin acting in an autocrine or paracrine manner. Therefore we hypothesized that the pheromonal-induced changes in maternal behavior are being mediated by altered prolactin receptor expression/sensitivity and/or increased production of brain prolactin. Using RT-PCR to measure levels of prolactin receptor and prolactin mRNA, we found changed expression of the 3 short forms and the long form of prolactin receptor mRNA in the arcuate nucleus, paraventricular nucleus, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, and MPOA with either exposure to male pheromones or pups. We also found changes in prolactin mRNA in the MPOA and paraventricular nucleus after exposure to pups or male pheromones. The data suggest that altered levels of expression of the receptor, coupled with local production of brain prolactin acting in an autocrine or paracrine manner, may cause a net change in prolactin cell signaling, which leads to adaptive responses which ensure reproductive success. 
 There is extensive evidence that dopamine is a key neurotransmitter mediating maternal behavior. In addition, there is some evidence that serotonin may also be involved in regulating maternal behavior. Therefore, we hypothesised that the pheromonal-induced changes in maternal behavior would be associated with increased dopaminergic and/or serotonergic neuronal activity in the MPOA and other areas of the brain implicated in maternal behavior expression. Using HPLC to measure levels of dopamine and serotonin and their respective metabolites, we found a significant increase in serotonergic and dopaminergic neuronal activity in the MPOA of virgin female C57BL/6J mice after 24 hours of pheromonal contact. The neuronal activity returned to basal levels after exposure to pups. The data suggest that male mouse pheromones increase serotonergic and dopaminergic neuronal activity in the MPOA, but that dopamine and serotonin levels are tightly regulated within strict parameters dependent on what physical stimuli the female is receiving. 
 Changes in prolactin levels are associated with altered responses to anxiety. There is an increased risk of anxiety and depression with sustained periods of hyperprolactinemia, and in the postpartum period, where there are fluctuations in prolactin levels, there is an increased risk of mood disorders. As pheromones change both serum and brain prolactin levels and prolactin modulates anxiety, we hypothesised that female mice exposed to pheromones would show altered behavioral responses to a standardized test of anxiety. We found that male pheromone-exposed mice showed decreased levels of anxiety on an elevated plus maze compared to individually housed controls. Female mice exposed to female pheromones displayed 2 disparate responses to the plus maze. One female from each cage showed increased anxiety, while her cage-mate showed decreased anxiety, yet both groups of female mice showed impaired maternal behavior. We infer, that in this model, male pheromones decrease anxiety, but anxiety and expression of maternal behavior are not directly correlated. 
 The major signal transduction pathway activated by prolactin binding to its receptors in the brain is the JAK/STAT signalling pathway, and in some neurons, in particular, the STAT5B pathway. The expression of prolactin and its receptor affect maternal behavior in mice. Therefore, we hypothesised that if the JAK/STAT STAT5B pathway is involved in maternal behavior, then STAT5B-deficient mice would have altered maternal behavior. We found that there were no significant differences in expression of full maternal behavior between the STAT5B-deficient mice and wild-type controls. The data suggest that STAT5B is not required for normal expression of maternal behavior. 
 We propose that the prolactin-mediated pheromonal increase in neurogenesis, alteration in monoamine synthesis, and alteration of prolactin and prolactin receptor mRNA levels facilitate expression of enhanced maternal behavior. We further propose that the pheromonal decrease in anxiety does not mediate enhanced maternal behavior. In addition, we propose that prolactin does not mediate maternal behavior through STAT5B. While pheromones have previously been reported to exert powerful actions on the reproductive system, these results demonstrate for the first time that male pheromones potentially complement the prolactin-mediated establishment of maternal behavior.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Pheromones</field><field name="subject">prolactin</field><field name="subject">developmental</field><field name="subject">neurobiology</field><field name="subject">parental behavior</field><field name="subject">animals</field><field name="subject">rodents</field><field name="subject">physiology</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20071019.134553</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The doctrine of salvation in the first letter of Peter : a theological-critical study</field><field name="creator">Williams, Martin</field><field name="description">The importance and richness of 1 Peter&#65533;s soteriological language is generally acknowledged by commentators. However, apart from a few scattered and sporadic remarks in commentaries and in articles no full-scale study of 1 Peter&#65533;s soteriology has been carried out. This thesis seeks to fill that gap by conducting a detailed theological-critical study of the concept of salvation in the first letter of Peter. 
 Part one of this thesis outlines the presuppositions and approach to theological-critical exegesis taken here. Basic to a theological exegesis of Scripture, it will be noted, is the recognition of its dual authorship as a divine and human communicative action embodied in written discourse. This means that the interpreter must be oriented primarily toward the subject matter of the biblical text and be committed to discerning the meaning placed there by the divine and human authors. This is another way of saying that the theological interpreter must take seriously the literal sense of the text. To do this, I will suggest, involves three things (each of which will be discussed): (1) literal sense exegesis; (2) intercanonical conversation; (2) intercatholic conversation. 
 Part two contains a detailed theological-critical analysis of those passages in 1 Peter that treat the topic of salvation: 1:1-2; 2:4-10 (election); 1:18-21; 2:21-25; 3:18 (atonement); 1:3, 23-25 (regeneration); 1:3-12; 3:18-4:6 (eschatological salvation). We will see that 1 Peter&#65533;s soteriological outlook exhibits a salvation-historical framework which locates the initiative for salvation in God&#65533;s eternal, sovereign and gracious electing purpose (1:1-2; 2:4-19), decisively inaugurated in the death (1:10-12, 18-21; 2:21-25; 3:18) and subsequent resurrection, ascension, exaltation and vindication of Christ (1:3, 11, 21; 2:4d, 7d; 3:18e, 19, 21d-22; 4:13; 5:1, 4, 10), existentially realized through the proclamation of the message of salvation (1:12, 23) and the experience of the new birth (1:3, 23), and finally consummated at the return of Christ when suffering and death will give way to life, victory and vindication (1:3-12; 3:18-4:6). Peter&#65533;s unique presentation of the believers&#65533; eschatological salvation in terms of future victory and vindication is designed to engender hope amongst a small minority of believers facing the onslaught of a hostile world against their faith. 
 In part three I seek to bring the results of my exegesis into dialogue with a variety of theological traditions (e.g., Reformed, Neo-orthodox, Lutheran, Arminian, Pelagian, Wesleyan) in order to allow 1 Peter to make its own distinctive contribution to the ongoing discussion (both between the traditions and between the bible and theology) but also to allow that dialogue to shape and sharpen our own understanding of salvation in 1 Peter. Because of the confines of space the discussion here is limited to the doctrines of election, atonement and regeneration. While at a conceptual level this thesis is an investigation of the concepts and presentation of salvation in the first letter of Peter, at a methodological level it further seeks to overcome the present and unfortunate segregation of biblical studies and theological studies and hopes further to open up the way for a more fruitful dialogue between the two.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bible</field><field name="subject">Biblical</field><field name="subject">New Testament</field><field name="subject">salvation</field><field name="subject">Christianity</field><field name="subject">doctrines</field><field name="subject">Peter</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20071120.160505</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Weeds, people and contested places : selected themes from the history of New Zealanders and their weeds 1770-1940</field><field name="creator">Clayton, Neil</field><field name="description">This study examines three basic questions. Why did so many familiar floral species with which agricultural people have more or less successfully contested places for some 10,000 years apparently become highly problematic in New Zealand? How did those in whom the developing contest aroused considerable anxiety try to solve the problems they saw emerging? And what were the outcomes of their chosen courses of action? This study is organised around three main themes, science, the law and agricultural practices. Within each theme I take into consideration the ways New Zealanders used particular aspects of these broad disciplines to try to identify, understand and solve the problems they perceived to have been caused by their weedy biota. I also consider the extent to which recourse to these means has helped or hindered the ends they sought. 
 The methodology adopted for this study is a variation of an 'organisational approach', advocated by the German environmental historian Frank Uekoetter. It focuses on the ways responses to perceived environmental problems are organised within a society. From my use of Uekoetter&#65533;s model I conclude that, despite a number of setbacks during the mid to late 19th century, by 1939 New Zealanders had developed highly dynamic processes within their weed science, extending into the wider farming community, by which they could feel their way with some confidence into a future where they might better manage the contest with their weeds, if not actually eradicate them.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">weeds</field><field name="subject">history</field><field name="subject">control</field><field name="subject">environmental</field><field name="subject">protection</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20071129.105550</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Pastoralism and the transformation of the rangelands of the South Island of New Zealand 1841 to 1912 : Mt Peel Station, a case study</field><field name="creator">Peden, Robert L</field><field name="description">The transformation of the rangelands of the South Island of New Zealand during the pastoral era fits into the wider international context of European expansion into the 'new' world. European settlers displaced native peoples, introduced 'old' world animals and plants, and imposed a capitalist system that converted local resources into international commodities. In New Zealand the orthodox explanation of the pastoral impact on the rangelands claims that pastoralists introduced an unsustainable system of land use to the region. The pastoralists&#65533; indiscriminate burning practices and overstocking with sheep opened up the country to invasion by rabbits. Burning and overgrazing by sheep and rabbits stripped the natural fertility of the soils and left the country depleted, eroded, and overwhelmed by pests and weeds. 
 This thesis sets out to test those claims. It explores burning, the stocking of the rangelands with sheep and the impact of rabbits in detail. It also examines other land management practices, as well as sheep breeding, to see what impact they had on the landscape. The timeframe is set between 1841, when formal British settlement was established in the South Island, and 1912, by which time most of the great estates and stations had been broken up into smaller runs and farms. 
 The thesis uses station diaries, memoirs, contemporary newspapers and farming journals to assess what happened on the ground during the pastoral era. In particular, the thesis uses Mt Peel Station as a case study to examine the intensification in land use that took place between 1841 and 1912, in order to explain the transformation of the landscape and to answer the questions: what happened, how did it happened and why did it happened as it did? 
 These sources illustrate that the pastoral era was characterised by innovation. Pastoralists had access to technical and scientific information from around the world. Some conducted their own experiments to improve the productivity of the land and their stock. There was also a learning process involved in adapting their methods to fit the local rangeland environments. They were not simply rapacious capitalists out to strip the wealth from the land for their own personal gain; indeed, many pastoralists set out to establish viable and sustainable enterprises. 
 The thesis argues that the rangelands consisted of a variety of landscapes and climates. Differences in resource endowments had a considerable influence in shaping the environmental outcomes on different stations. Aridity and rabbits were two key factors in the depletion of the vegetation and the degradation of the landscape in the rangelands. Runs in semi-arid districts that were overwhelmed by rabbits suffered long-term damage. In districts where rainfall was more reliable stations that had been overrun by rabbits recovered remarkably quickly. Stations like Mt Peel, that were largely unaffected by the first rabbit plague, were able to maintain and even increase their productivity up to the time they were subdivided. The orthodox analysis of the transformation of the rangelands in the pastoral era does not account for these differences in outcomes.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">sheep ranches</field><field name="subject">South Island</field><field name="subject">history</field><field name="subject">land tenure</field><field name="subject">right of pasture</field><field name="subject">pastoral systems</field><field name="subject">Timaru district</field><field name="subject">Mount Peel Station</field><field name="subject">Mt Peel</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20071204.155512</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dr Edward Shortland and the politics of ethnography</field><field name="creator">Lousberg, Marjan</field><field name="description">In 1840 Captain William Hobson established the colony of New Zealand under an umbrella of humanitarianism and with an agenda for the protection of Maori rights. This thesis examines this project through the work of Dr Edward Shortland (1812-1893). Although Shortland&#65533;s reports and publications have been frequently cited, there has been no detailed historical analysis of his work. 
 Shortland arrived in New Zealand in 1841 as the private secretary of Governor Hobson. In 1842 he was appointed Protector of Aborigines for the Eastern Districts. One of his tasks was to study Maori language and customs in order to mediate between Maori and government. He was one of the earliest European experts on Maori traditions, customary practices, religious attitudes and relationships with land. After his return to England in 1846, he lobbied the British government on behalf of Maori and published two books on New Zealand, in which he addressed prospective colonists and disputed some of the propaganda of colonising companies. Shortland came back to New Zealand in the 1860s, 1870s and 1880s, during which periods he worked as Civil Commissioner in the Hauraki area, as Native Secretary, and as adviser to the government on Native affairs. 
 Shortland was part of a network of concerned Christian humanitarians who were intent on bringing government and law and order to New Zealand in a manner that facilitated peaceful European settlement, without serious injury to the Maori population. Humanitarians were not opposed to colonisation or settlement and in this respect may be seen as part of the imperial enterprise. In the framework of political and philosophical thought in the nineteenth century, humanitarians expected no more than to mitigate the effects of colonisation. This study explores these issues in the context of Shortland&#65533;s interaction with and ethnography about Maori over a period of forty years. 
 I begin by placing the concept of aboriginal protection in context. The core of this thesis is an examination of Shortland&#65533;s work as Protector of Aborigines. He had three tasks: to mediate in disputes between Europeans and Maori; to accustom Maori to English law; and to protect Maori land rights against claims from settlers. The first of these tasks proved the most straightforward. Shortland&#65533;s attempts to fulfil the second task highlighted the complex relationship between religion and law and the role of Christianity. The land question proved the most complicated, as a result of the tension between government attempts to protect Maori land rights, the pressure from settlers for land, and European lack of understanding of Maori customs. Maori desire to sell land to attract settlers further complicated relationships. Shortland&#65533;s contribution to our understanding of these issues and of Maori traditions of land tenure is considerable. While the course of colonisation may have been inevitable, I suggest that Shortland and likeminded contemporaries laid the foundation for later recognition of Maori rights, as exemplified today by the work of the Waitangi Tribunal.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Edward Shortland</field><field name="subject">ethnology</field><field name="subject">ethnologists</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">history</field><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">people</field><field name="subject">19th century</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20071204.160209</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Personal risk management in pilots</field><field name="creator">Pauley, Keryn A</field><field name="description">Risk management is a key component of aeronautical decision-making and one of the possible causes of pilot error (e.g., Jensen, Guilke, &amp; Hunter, 1997). Risk management encompasses risk perception and risk tolerance. Risk perception involves the detection of risks associated with a situation, whereas risk tolerance is the willingness to accept a given degree of risk (Hunter, 2002). Previous studies using flight simulators have found that risk perception and risk tolerance differs between pilots who fly into adverse weather and those who do not (e.g., O&#65533;Hare, Owen, Jorgensen, Wiegmann, Hunter, &amp; Mullen, 2007). The aim of this research was to assess risk perception and risk tolerance using scenario-based measures. The measure of risk perception was developed over three studies. Since risk perception is a skill which expert pilots exercise (Jensen et al., 1997), I used the Cochran-Weiss-Shanteau (CWS, Weiss &amp; Shanteau, 2003) index to measure how good pilots were at perceiving aeronautical risks. Weiss and Shanteau assumed that an expert should be able to discriminate between two relevant stimuli, and do so consistently. Participants were presented with flight scenarios and rated the risk involved in each scenario from 0 (low risk) to 100 (high risk). If a valid measure of expertise in risk perception, those with experience in aeronautical decision-making should have been better at this task. In study one the qualified pilots had higher and more variable CWS scores than the non-pilots, suggesting that some pilots were expert at this task, whereas most non-pilots were poor at this task. The focus of study two was shifted to weather-related decision-making (WRDM). Geography students, student pilots, and qualified pilots did not differ in their mean CWS scores, although the qualified pilots were most discriminating, and the geography students were most consistent. To decrease the reliance of the task on memory, study three included a blocking task in between each scenario. While only a small scale study, the results suggested that the blocking task improved the qualified pilots&#65533; performance while the geography students&#65533; performance deteriorated. In study four, I used Lopes&#65533;s (1987) theory to measure risk tolerance in pilots. According to Lopes (1987), risk tolerant individuals are motivated by opportunity, or what they can gain from taking risks, whereas risk averse individuals are motivated by threat, or what they can lose from taking risks. Qualified pilots were presented with 36 flight scenarios, varying in the level of threat and opportunity. The pilots rated the likelihood of going on the flights. Multiple regression equations were calculated, measuring the influence of threat and opportunity on each pilot&#65533;s ratings. Pilots were largely risk averse, as their ratings were influenced by threat. The two pilots whose ratings were influenced by opportunity had experienced more aviation incidents compared to the pilots who were not influenced by opportunity. The aim of study five was to assess the relationship between risk management and in-flight WRDM. Qualified pilots completed a simulated flight into adverse weather, and four-computer based measures: the expertise in risk perception measure developed in study three, the risk tolerance measure developed in study four, and two implicit association tests assessing implicit risk perception and anxiousness towards adverse weather. Twelve pilots continued beyond the critical decision point, 18 pilots diverted, and 2 pilots crashed. There was no relationship between in-flight WRDM and expertise in weather-related risk perception. However, the pilots who diverted gave higher ratings of risk during the CWS task compared to the pilots who crashed. The pilots who diverted also tended to be more risk averse and implicitly perceived more risk in adverse weather, compared to the pilots who continued, suggesting a relationship between risk management and decision-making in a simulated flight into adverse weather. These five studies further highlight the role of risk management in pilot decision-making. The tools developed in these studies have potential for measuring risk management in pilots.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">aeronautics</field><field name="subject">risk management</field><field name="subject">decision making</field><field name="subject">air pilots</field><field name="subject">flight</field><field name="subject">weather</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20071010.090032</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effects of a Clark Twin Block appliance on mandibular motion</field><field name="creator">O'Shea, Catherine Laurance</field><field name="description">The mandible is able to move in a complex fashion, with variable combinations of both translation and rotation in three dimensions (six degrees of freedom), at any given time during function. 
 Research into the process of accurately capturing three-dimensional functional movement of the mandible has many broad clinical applications in dentistry and medicine alike. Anatomical kinematics of the craniofacial skeleton that includes motion analysis has potential scope for clinicians in the areas of diagnostics, treatment planning and treatment outcome assessment. 
 The aims of this study were to describe mandibular motion during opening-closing tasks of two adult subjects and one growing subject with a Class II malocclusion, undergoing growth modification with a Clark Twin Block appliance. Motion analysis recordings were taken with the use of a twelve-camera motion analysis system (Motion Analysis Corporation). The values of the kinematic variables (translation [millimeters] and rotation [degrees]) of mandibular opening-closing that were obtained were consistent and repeatable for both adult subjects throughout this study. In contrast, those values obtained from the subject who wore a functional appliance show noticeable changes in the motion patterning during the initial stages (recordings taken at four and at eight weeks) of appliance wear. These are most apparent in the translation data recorded along the anterior-posterior axis. Mandibular motion however, seemed to return to near pre-treatment patterning in this individual following one year following the initiation of the appliance wear. These observations were seen in one experimental individual. Further research is needed to elucidate whether such changes in motion patterning are seen normally in the growing individual, or, are accountable due to the clinical intervention with an orthodontic appliance. 
 This study piloted the use of two different splint designs for the purposes of recording mandibular motion in the two adult subjects. There were no significant differences in the recording of mandibular motion between the two different splint designs. One design has been recommended for future studies due to its overall ease of fabrication and intra-oral comfort for the subjects.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">mandible</field><field name="subject">mechanical</field><field name="subject">properties</field><field name="subject">malocclusion</field><field name="subject">orthodontic</field><field name="subject">appliances</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20071205.160408</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A comparison of osseointegration in conventionally versus immediately restored implants in a sheep model</field><field name="creator">Kim, James H</field><field name="description">Objectives: To compare the osseointegration of conventionally and immediately restored tapered implants in a split-mouth animal model, and to compare different methods of analysis for measuring osseointegration. 
 Materials &amp; Methods: Twenty tapered implants were placed in the posterior mandibles of ten sheep, three months after premolar extractions. Ten control implants were placed and were restored after three months submerged healing. Ten test implants were placed on the contralateral side at this time and immediately restored. Animals were sacrificed after a further three months healing. Resonance frequency analysis (Implant Stability Quotient, ISQ), and standardized radiographs were taken at all stages. Alveolar bone height relative to the implant shoulder was measured on digitized radiographs. Histomorphometric and micro-Computed Tomograph ([mu]CT) morphometric analysis for Bone-to-Implant Contact (BIC) and Bone Density (BD) were performed. Radiographic, stability and morphometric measurements were compared statistically. 
 Results: Only three (30%) of conventionally restored and two (20%) immediately restored implants survived (p = 0.74). Mean crestal bone level after three months loading differed significantly (control 5.3 &#65533; 0.9 mm versus test 0.9 &#65533; 1.3 mm; p = 0.02). Control implants lost more crestal bone over three months than test implants but this was not statistically significant (3.5 &#65533; 1.0 mm versus 0.7 &#65533; 1.0 mm; p = 0.06). The test group showed a higher mean ISQ value (85.4 &#65533; 6.9) compared to the control group (72 &#65533; 14.4; p = 0.349). Both groups showed a slightly reduced stability during the loaded period. This was more marked for the test group but not statistically significant (-0.5 &#65533; 3.8 ISQ versus -4.35 &#65533; 6.6 ISQ; p = 0.8). A statistically significant negative correlation was found between the loss of crestal bone and ISQ with loading (Pearson&#65533;s coefficient of correlation r = -0.473 p = 0.026). Both groups showed a statistically significant difference in BIC for both histomorphometric analaysis (HMA); p = 0.039 and [mu]CT morphometric analysis; p = 0.013. When the two forms of morphometric analysis were compared, HMA and [mu]CT morphometric analysis differed significantly for both BIC (p = 0.05) and BD (p = 0.048). However, a statistically significant correlation was found between the two measuring techniques, for both BIC (r = 0.335 p = 0.013) and BD (r = 0.439 p = 0.01). 
 Conclusions: The placement of wide-bodied 3i Osseotite NT[TM] tapered implants into sheep mandible resulted in high failure rate regardless of the loading protocol. The sheep mandibular model may be inappropriate as a model for evaluation of immediate loading, and to test implants which are designed for soft bone. Further investigations are needed to look into the variations in bone microstructure along with their impact on the mechanics of implant-bone union. Although a statistically significant difference was found between the two measurement techniques, a positive correlation was found between HMA and [mu]CT morphometric analysis suggesting non-invasive methods may have a potential in assessing osseointegration. Further research is required to optimize the variables in [mu]CT analysis, such as, voltage, filters, and thresholding to minimize artifacts and to maximize bone contrast when titanium implants are present.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">osseointegrated dental implants</field><field name="subject">osseointegration</field><field name="subject">measurement</field><field name="subject">alveolar process</field><field name="subject">sheep</field><field name="subject">physiology</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20071206.162016</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An international comparison of postgraduate orthodontic students and programmes</field><field name="creator">Anning, Ross J</field><field name="description">Objectives. Although there have been some studies of the characteristics of orthodontic students and orthodontic programmes in the US, there has been little investigation of those in the Commonwealth. This study will attempt to identify the demographic characteristics of postgraduate orthodontic students, and the curriculum and organisation of orthodontic programmes in the English-speaking world, with the hope that this information may be used to aid in the planning of orthodontic training and future treatment provision. 
 Materials and Methods. An on-line survey was used to question postgraduate orthodontic students studying in the 93 programmes worldwide in countries where the first language is English. The questionnaire itself was built using the online survey tool www.surveymonkey.com and was accessible to respondents for two months (January 2007 through March 2007). Statistical analysis was then carried out using the SPSS statistical program. 
 Results. Of the 301 respondents, 55% were male and 45% female; 57.8% were from US programmes and 42.2% from the Commonwealth. The mean age of respondents was 29.8 years. The mean programme duration was 31.0 months in the US and 37.1 months in the Commonwealth, with the mean total patient loads being 84 and 106 respectively. A wide variety of treatment modalities were used in both groups. The mean annual tuition fee was considerably higher in the US (US$23,200) than in the Commonwealth (US$16,500); however, a higher proportion (47.2%) of US respondents received scholarships or stipends than Commonwealth respondents (29.1%). The overall mean debt upon graduation was US$118,200 and the mean expected income five years after graduation was US$283,200. Private practice was the most popular career path (90.3%), with fewer than one-third of respondents indicating that they would consider an academic career. 
 Conclusions. The current study indicates that the demographic characteristics of orthodontic students are very similar to those most recently reported. Certain trends have continued, such as the increasing proportion of female students, and the increase in programme duration in the US. Data presented in the clinical and financial sections of this represent the greatest areas of change. Total patient case-load is increasing, and the types of treatment being carried out by students show marked differences from previous studies. The continuing increase in tuition fees is reported, along with increased levels of debt upon graduation, and this is seen to be having an effect on the expected career paths of orthodontic students, with fewer students looking to enter an academic career. This situation may need to be addressed to ensure the continued development and strength of orthodontic faculty members, and, hence, that of orthodontic training programmes.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">United States</field><field name="subject">orthodontics</field><field name="subject">graduate</field><field name="subject">study</field><field name="subject">teaching</field><field name="subject">commonwealth</field><field name="subject">universities</field><field name="subject">colleges</field><field name="subject">dental schools</field><field name="subject">students</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20071207.110304</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The molecular basis of orthodontic tooth movement : cytokine signaling by PDL cells in tension an in vitro study</field><field name="creator">Pinkerton, Mark Neil</field><field name="description">The pressure-tension hypothesis is the governing dogma of orthodontic tooth movement. This theory proposes that the application of loads to the crown of a tooth during orthodontic mechano-therapy results in differential site-specific reactionary strains in the para-dental tissues. Briefly, following the application of orthodontic load the bone and periodontal ligament (PDL) on one side of the tooth is placed in compression favoring bone resorption, while on the other side of the tooth they are placed in tension favoring osteogenesis The present in vitro model provides a surrogate for the PDL on the tension side of the tooth during orthodontic tooth movement and aims to identify mechanically induced changes in the expression of osteo-regulatory cytokines in human PDL cell cultures in response to tensile mechanical strain. 
 Materials and Methods: PDL explants were obtained from pathology free bicuspids of two human subjects following extraction of the teeth for orthodontic purposes. Following serial passage, cells were plated on Uniflex&#65533; plates and consigned to either the experimental or control groups. Experimental cells were exposed to a cyclic uniaxial tensile mechanical strain for 6,12 or 24 hours using the Flexercell FX 4000 strain unit. Total RNA was extracted using a two-step procedure and samples were analysed using real-time RT-PCR assays for a range of osteo-regulatory cytokines. 
 Results: Human PDL cells expressed mRNA for a range of cytokines of known significance to osteogenesis and osteoclastogenesis in response to mechanical stimulation. 
 Conclusions: The production of osteo-regulatory cytokines by PDL cells in response to mechanical strain suggests that these cells have the potential to contribute to the osseous modeling of orthodontic tooth movement. The presence of osteogenic signalling drive in response to tensile strain tends to support the basic assertions of the pressure-tension hypothesis.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">teeth</field><field name="subject">movements</field><field name="subject">molecular aspects</field><field name="subject">cytokines</field><field name="subject">mechanism</field><field name="subject">periodontal ligament</field><field name="subject">orthodontics</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20071207.161056</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effect of intermittent tensile strain on RANKL, OPG, M-CSF and IL-1&#946; expression by periodontal ligament fibroblasts in vitro</field><field name="creator">Gaffey, Benjamin James</field><field name="description">Mechanical stress has been shown to play a role in bone remodelling during orthodontic tooth movement. Receptor activator of nuclear factor k&#946; - ligand (RANKL), osteoprotegerin (OPG), monocyte colony stimulating factor (M-CSF) and interleukin 1-&#946; (IL-1&#946;) play key roles in the regulation of bone remodelling, but the role of these cytokines in orthodontic tooth movement is poorly understood. 
 Aim: The aim of this experiment was to examine the response of periodontal ligament (PDL) fibroblasts in monolayer culture to intermittent tensile stress as regards RANKL, OPG, M-CSF and IL-1&#946; production. 
 Methods: Human PDL fibroblasts were dissected from premolars extracted for orthodontic purposes. Explants were seeded out in 1cm wells and grown to confluence in Dulbecco&#65533;s modification of Eagle&#65533;s medium, containing 10% foetal calf serum and antibiotics, at 37&#65533;C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO&#8322;/95% air. Upon reaching confluence, the cells were passaged into sequentially larger flasks. Fibroblasts were passaged 6 times. After reaching confluence in T175 flasks, the cells were detached and plated at a cell density of 10&#8309;/dish in 35mm Bioflex&#65533; Plates coated with type 1 collagen. The cells were placed under a continuous uni-axial strain of 12% for 6s of every 90s by a Flexercell FX 4000C[TM] for 0, 12, 24 and 48 hours. Cells were then detached and stored in RNAlater. Quantitative RT-PCR was used to determine the mRNA of the cytokines of interest. 
 Results: Tensile force led to the down regulation of mRNA expression for OPG and IL-1&#946; at 12 and 24 hours respectively, while M-CSF was up-regulated at 6 hours. RANKL was not detected at a significant level for quantification. 
 Conclusion: This osteoclastic-type response indicates the complexity of mechanotransduction in an in vitro setting.

The Live/Dead stain was used to determine the influence of haem availability on the resistance of P. gingivalis and P. intermedia to the reactive oxygen species (ROS) superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide and compare the sensitivities between the haem-requiring periodontal bacteria to ROS. Neutrophils use oxidative and non-oxidative killing mechanisms. During phagocytosis, neutrophils kill bacteria via a respiratory burst, producing ROS. P. gingivalis and P. intermedia are oxygen-tolerant gram-negative bacteria found in the gingival crevice. These bacteria express superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, which extends some protection against superoxide radicals. 
 Methods: Initially, experiments were performed to validate the reliability and accuracy of the fluorogenic Live/Dead stain using Escherichia coli ATCC 10798 (K-12), followed by experiments using P. gingivalis. The Live/Dead stain distinguishes viable:non-viable proportions of bacteria using mixtures of green (SYTO 9) and red (propidium iodide) fluorescent nucleic acid stains respectively. Bacterial cell viability was assessed with fluorescence microscopy and subsequently quantitative measurement using a fluorescence microplate reader (BMG Fluorostar plus Optima). P. gingivalis and P. intermedia colonies were subcultured from frozen cultures, in Tryptic soy broth (TSB) (Difco) and incubated anaerobically for approximately five days. They were further subcultured in pre-reduced TSB, supplemented with menadione 0.5[mu]g/ml (TSB-M) and either 5 [mu]g/ml haemin (Haem 5), 50 [mu]g/ml haemin (Haem 50) or without supplemental haemin (Haem 0). Cultures were grown anaerobically at 37&#65533;C to early stationary phase (approximately 48 hours). For experimental purposes, bacteria were harvested, washed and resuspended in 10 mM Tris-buffered saline (pH 7.5) containing peptone (TBS-P) (0.1 mg/ml), with a final adjustment to OD&#8325;&#8324;&#8320; [approximately equals] 2.0 (which corresponds to 1 x 10&#8313; bacteria/ml). Bacterial suspensions were diluted ([approximately equals] 10&#8312;/ml) into TBS-P containing the fluorogenic viability stain (BacLight, Molecular Probes). Either pyrogallol (0.02 - 2 mM) or hydrogen peroxide (0.01 - 100 mM) was added (except to control tubes); tubes were vortexed for ten seconds and incubated at 37&#65533;C. Viability was monitored fluorimetrically for three hours. 
 Results: For both P. gingivalis and P. intermedia, a pyrogallol concentration of 0.2 mM resulted in 80 to 90% cell death; and a hydrogen peroxide concentration of 10 mM killed approximately 80 to 90% of cells. Irrespective of the haem status, no significant difference was determined between the overall maximum rate of killing of P. gingivalis and P. intermedia, in their response to either superoxide or hydrogen peroxide; with the exception that the P. intermedia Haem 0 group was significantly less susceptible to hydrogen peroxide than the P. gingivalis Haem 0 group. For the majority of the experiments, there was no significant difference between final bacterial cell viability in the Haem 0 and Haem 5 cells for both species, after 3 hours exposure to various concentrations of ROS. However, the Haem 50 cells showed a significant increased susceptibility (albeit, a small difference) to both hydrogen peroxide and superoxide. 
 Conclusions: The Live/Dead bacterial viability stain provided a valuable method to monitor "real-time" killing, avoiding the difficulties associated with culture-based methods for assessing viability. Haem availability had no clear influence on the resistance to ROS of either P. gingivalis or P. intermedia Haem 0 and Haem 5 cells. The Haem 50 cells showed a very slight increase in susceptibility to hydrogen peroxide and superoxide. Although P. intermedia may be isolated in significant numbers from healthy gingivae, as well as from periodontally diseased sites, it was no more resistant to ROS than was P. gingivalis, which is associated with periodontal lesions and difficult to cultivate from relatively healthy (more oxygenated) sites. This suggests that resistance to ROS does not contribute to the ecological distinction between these two species. The finding that haem availability did not influence sensitivity implies that these bacteria do not accumulate haem for the purpose of protection from ROS.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">porphyromonas gingivalis</field><field name="subject">prevotella intermedia</field><field name="subject">active oxygen</field><field name="subject">superoxide</field><field name="subject">hydrogen peroxide</field><field name="subject">bacterial</field><field name="subject">cell surfaces</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20071211.104926</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Thailand and leisure oriented cross-border mobility : constraints and permeability</field><field name="creator">Jittithavorn, Chompunuch</field><field name="description">Studies of tourism statistics have revealed that tourism movements worldwide are based on intraregional tourism, which includes cross-border mobility, rather than long-haul tourism. Although there have been studies on borders carried out in the past for various purposes, there remains a distinct lack of research into cross-border leisure-oriented mobility, particularly in Southeast Asia. As a result, examining constraints and permeability on leisure-oriented cross-border mobility may well help to overcome the tourist behaviour and cross-border mobility divide in literature, thus the subject of this thesis. The aims of this thesis are to investigate an identifiable sector of the population (i.e. Thai university students) and to analyze the motivations that drive, and constraints that limit their ability to travel to the neighbouring countries of Cambodia, Laos, Malaysia, and Myanmar. 
 Using a self-administered closed-questionnaire, data was collected from 750 students in seven universities in three provinces: Assumption, Kasetsart, and Thammasart Universities in Bangkok, Naresuan, and Pibunsongkram Rajabhat Universities, in Phitsanulok, and Mae Fah Luang and Chiang Rai Rajabhat Universities in Chiang Rai. The data was collected from October to December 2005. A response rate of approximately fifty percent was achieved. 
 Analysis of the data showed that Thai university students were motivated by visiting heritage and historical sites to cross borders to Cambodia, Laos, and Myanmar; whereas, the driving force for visits to Malaysia was to see new things and places. Interestingly, fear emerged as the constraint which most limited the students from travelling over the border to each of Thailand&#65533;s neighbouring countries. Psychological constraints were reported as having more influence on the respondents&#65533; border crossings than physical constraints. Distance from the borders also influenced cross-border ability. The study showed that cross-border travel behaviour was related to gender and income, but unrelated to the respondents&#65533; age. The research revealed that the respondents felt the easiest way to overcome their constraints to travel was to gain more travel experience and search for more information on their destination of choice. 
 Interviews were gathered from fifteen key persons employed in five different fields of the travel industry and whose work related either directly and indirectly to cross-border mobility. The interviews took place during November 2005 to February 2006 at informants&#65533; workplaces in Bangkok and Chiang Rai. It was revealed that tourism development in border areas is regarded by society as having substantial social and economic benefits to the local people and their communities. It also revealed that borders do not have any direct physical effects toward people&#65533;s movement. 
 It was found that the tenets of people&#65533;s leisure-oriented cross-border mobility were formed by both motivations and constraints; therefore, individuals must find a way to negotiate or overcome constraints before achieving the actual action. The uniqueness of the study was to illustrate the dynamic and simultaneous treatment of the fundamentals contributing to cross border mobility. 
 This thesis has broken new ground in analyzing the theories developed predominantly in Western contexts of travel motivations and leisure constraints in an Asian setting, particularly in the context of Thai studies. It was found that the Thai tourist behaviour especially the university students, who are an important and significant and separate population, are difference from those students in the Western society in that Thai university students more concern in cross-border travelling to gain knowledge than to enjoy nightlife (sex, alcohol, and drugs).</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Thailand</field><field name="subject">Southeast Asia</field><field name="subject">boundaries</field><field name="subject">tourism</field><field name="subject">travelers</field><field name="subject">college students</field><field name="subject">attitudes</field><field name="subject">leisure</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20071018.114257</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Espiritu de subversion : la construccion del discurso de la mujer en la narrativa posmoderna hispanoamericana</field><field name="creator">Regoczy, Lucia Graciela</field><field name="description">This thesis offers a typology of Postmodern women&#65533;s discourse from a sociological perspective. By focusing on the reading of Gioconda Belli&#65533;s Sofia de los presagios, Isabel Allende&#65533;s Paula, and Anacristina Rossi&#65533;s La loca de Gandoca, it examines how each writer achieves, thanks to the process of dialogism and the carnivalesque, a critique of social and aesthetic values, associated with Eurocentric discourse. 
 Thanks to these two processes, the values associated with the marginalized position of women in Latin America, are brought to the surface, offering a better understanding of the relation that exists between women&#65533;s literary production and the cultural environment. 
 Chapter one offers an overview of the concepts associated with Posmodernism, and its relevance in the Latin American context. This chapter also outlines the key concepts associated with dialogism and the carnivalesque. 
 Chapter two examines the use of the carnivalesque in two plays by Sor Juana Ines de la Cruz, Los empenos de una casa and Amor es mas laberinto as antecedents of subversive writing in Spanish American women&#65533;s writing. It discusses how Sor Juana through appropriation and inversion, transforms her texts into a critique of marginalized social groups. This chapter proposes that Sor Juana sets the model for the subversive nature of Spanish American women&#65533;s writing. 
 Chapter three offers a reading of Cristina Peri Rossi&#65533;s El libro de mis primos as an example of radical feminist discourse produced in the 60&#65533;s, focusing on the use of parody and irony as means of transgressing patriarchal discourse. 
 Chapter four examines Gioconda Belli&#65533;s Sofia de los presagios, and the incorporation of ancestral and modern myths, to accentuate women&#65533;s marginality and the conflicting and contradictory nature of Nicaraguan society. 
 Chapter five focuses on a reading of Isabel Allende&#65533;s Paula in which the techniques of magical realism and the carnivalesque are brought together to criticize social and cultural practices that marginalize women. 
 Chapter six examines Anacristina Rossi&#65533;s La loca de Gandoca. It focuses on the way Rossi makes use of popular music, romantic literature, poetry, and bureaucratic discourse, to denounce the exploitation and destruction of Costa Rica&#65533;s natural resources through ecotourism.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Spanish</field><field name="subject">American</field><field name="subject">Latin America</field><field name="subject">fiction</field><field name="subject">literature</field><field name="subject">women</field><field name="subject">authors</field><field name="subject">feminism</field><field name="subject">postmodernism</field><field name="subject">carnival</field><field name="subject">history</field><field name="subject">criticism</field><field name="subject">interpretation</field><field name="subject">20th century</field><field name="subject">Sister Juana Ines de la Cruz (1651-1695)</field><field name="subject">Cristina Peri Rossi (1941-)</field><field name="subject">Gioconda  Belli (1948-)</field><field name="subject">Isabel Allende</field><field name="subject">Anacristina Rossi</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070927.141659</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The influence of the commercialisation of the economy on maritime policy in Ming China</field><field name="creator">Li, Kangying</field><field name="description">The Ming maritime prohibition policy (1371-1568) reversed the maritime policies of the preceeding Tang, Song and Yuan dynasties. It was maintained for two centuries at considerable costs, but in 1568 was eventually abolished. There has not yet been a satisfactory analysis of this policy, which addresses the issues of why it was introduced, why it was maintained for so long, and why, eventually, it was overturned. This thesis takes a new approach to understanding these issues. Instead of focusing solely on external factors, such as the need for defence against Japanese piracy, it focuses on the internal situation of Ming society, and instead of focusing on the policy as an epiphenomenon it considers the social foundation for Ming foreign trade policy. 
 In this thesis, the maritime policy is treated as a product of the social, economic and political configurations of Ming China. It argues that the establishment of the policy, its maintenance and abolition reflect two different socio-economic structures, hence two different political bases. The suppression of commerce during the early Ming reflected the interests of the political elite that came to power with the establishment of the new dynasty. The abolition of the maritime prohibition reflected the way the commercialisation of the socio-economic landscape brought a new political e&#769;lite to power, in which many more officials with merchant-family backgrounds participated in the policymaking process. Commercialisation drove the social re-configuration and reshaped the political landscape, and this resulted in the late Ming years in an overturn of many of the policies that had been introduced at the beginning of the dynasty. Such a structural approach allows us to gain a richer understanding of the maritime prohibition policy.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">China</field><field name="subject">marine</field><field name="subject">merchants</field><field name="subject">history</field><field name="subject">economic policy</field><field name="subject">Ming dynasty</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20071001.155057</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Punishment and human signal detection</field><field name="creator">Lie, Celia</field><field name="description">Detection and choice research have largely focused on the effects of relative reinforcer frequencies or magnitudes. The effects of punishment have received much less attention. This thesis investigated the effects of punishment on human signal-detection performance using a number of different procedures. These included punisher frequency and magnitude variations, different types of punishers (point loss &amp; time-outs), variations in stimulus disparity, and different detection tasks (judgments of stimulus arrays containing either more blue or red objects, or judgments of statements that were either true or false). It examined whether punishers have similar, but opposite, effects to reinforcers on detection performance, and whether the effects of punishment were successfully captured by existing models of punishment and choice. 
 Experiment 1 varied the relative frequency or magnitude of time-out punishers for errors using the blue/red task. Participants were systematically biased away from the response alternative associated with the higher rate or magnitude of time-out punishers in two of three procedures. Experiment 2 varied the relative frequency of point-loss punishers using the blue/red task and the true/false task. Participants were systematically biased away from the alternative associated with the higher rate of point-loss punishers for the true/false task. 
 Experiment 3 examined the effects of punishment on response bias from a psychophysical perspective. Previous detection research which varied stimulus discriminability while holding reinforcers ratios constant and unequal (Johnstone &amp; Alsop, 2000; McCarthy &amp; Davison, 1984) found that a criterion location measure (e.g., c, Green &amp; Swets, 1966) was a better descriptor of isobias functions compared to a likelihood ratio measure (e.g., log &#946;[G], Green &amp; Swets, 1966). Experiment 3 varied stimulus discriminability while holding punisher ratios constant and unequal. Like previous research, isobias functions were consistent with a criterion location measure. 
 Experiments 4, 5, 6, and 7 examined contemporary models of choice and punishment. Experiments 4, 5, and 6 varied the relative reinforcer ratio in detection tasks, both with and without the inclusion of an equal rate of punishment. Experiment 7 held the reinforcer ratio constant and unequal, and varied the durations of time-out punishers. Increases in preference (for the richer alternative) from reinforcer-only conditions to reinforcer + punisher conditions would support a subtractive model of punishment, while decreases in preference would support an additive model of punishment. 
 Experiment 4 was a between-groups study using time-out punishers. It supported the predictions of an additive model. Experiment 5 used three different procedures in a preliminary within-subjects design, evaluating which procedure was best suited for a larger within-subjects experiment (Experiment 6). In Experiment 6, participants sat four reinforcer-only and four reinforcer + punisher conditions where reinforcers were point-gains and punishers were point-losses. The results from Experiment 6 were mixed - some participants showed increased preference while others showed little change or a slight decrease. This appeared related to the order in which participants received the reinforcer-only and reinforcer + punisher conditions. Experiment 7 also found no consistent change in preference with increases in time-out durations. Instead, there was a slow increase in bias on the richer alternative across the eight sessions. 
 Overall, punishers had similar, but opposite, effects to reinforcers in detection procedures (Experiments 1, 2, &amp; 3). These effects were successfully captured by Davison and Tustin&#65533;s (1978) model of detection. The later experiments did not provide support for a subtractive model punishment model of choice, which had provided the best descriptor in corresponding concurrent-schedule research. Instead, Experiment 4 supported an additive model, and Experiments 5, 6, and 7 provided no evidence for either model - limitations and implications of these studies are discussed. However, the present thesis illustrates that the signal detection procedure is promising for studying the combined effects of reinforcement and punishment, and may offer a worthwhile complement to standard concurrent-schedule choice procedures.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">punishment</field><field name="subject">signal</field><field name="subject">detection</field><field name="subject">psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20071004.134135</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Coordination and its acquisition in a lower limb multi-articular interceptive task</field><field name="creator">Chow, Jia Yi</field><field name="description">The complexity in human movement has provided a theoretical challenge for movement scientists to comprehend the underlying processes controlling joint movements in a functional and goal-directed manner. Although there has been an increase in research on examining coordination in multi-articular actions, it is still in its infancy. The aim of this thesis was to examine the acquisition of coordination of a discrete multi-articular movement action from the theoretical perspective of Dynamical Systems Theory. Specifically, four different studies examined key research questions raised about understanding the coordination and control of a lower limb multi-articular interceptive action. The thesis concludes with a brief discussion on the key findings and the implications for practitioners in physical education pedagogy relating to a games teaching approach. 
 A discrete multi-articular kicking action with specific task constraints (kicking over a height barrier and to different target positions) was utilised as a research vehicle to examine differences in coordination between three groups of participants: skilled, intermediates and novices. From group analysis, it was determined that skilled and intermediate groups demonstrated a functional coordination mode involving a restricted range of motion at the proximal joints and a larger range of motion at distal joints, mimicking a 'chip-like action' in soccer. In contrast, large range of joint motions throughout the kicking limb were seen for the novice participants who demonstrated a 'driving-like action'. Analysis of ball trajectory data confirmed that novice participants were not able to successfully project the ball over the height barrier. Findings from this study suggested that the observed range of motion is dependent on skill level and task constraints. Functional foot speed at ball contact to various target positions demonstrated by skilled and intermediate players further highlighted the possibility of using a model of learning focusing on coordination to examine progression through the different stages of learning. A multiple single-participant design was further used to investigate coordination of skilled players to determine if refined differences could be present at the skilled level of performance. Although global similarities in terms of the use of a chipping action in projecting the ball was found, differences in foot position for the non-kicking foot and centre of mass displacement near ball contact emphasised that even skilled individuals can demonstrate different coordination solutions to meet the same task goal. Such an observation highlights the concept of degeneracy in the control and coordination of human movement and also provides the impetus to further examine coordination changes in novice learners as a function of practice using multiple single-participant analysis. From the study, individual learners demonstrated different progression trends in terms of joint motion changes while achieving the same task goal. Intra-participant analysis showed how the ball can be projected accurately across the height barrier with both a 'scooping' and a 'chipping' action. When referenced to a model of learning (Newell, 1985), foot speed at ball contact was functionally manipulated by the novice participants to target positions with varying height and accuracy constraints by later stages of learning. It was further suggested that the dynamics of the learner prior to practicing the task could influence the eventual kicking action that emerged. To further investigate learning from a dynamical systems perspective, key features like transitions between preferred movement patterns and role of movement patterns variability in effecting such transitions, were examined. It was determined through the use of cluster analysis procedures that increased movement pattern variability was not a pre-requisite for a transition between preferred movement patterns across participants. Informational and intentional constraints can have a role to play in effecting the search for pathways of change in movement patterns especially in discrete trial-based multi-articular actions. 
 This thesis has contributed novel knowledge regarding examining coordination changes for a selected discrete multi-articular lower limb action. Focusing on investigating changes in coordination has enabled a detailed examination on the process of change with practice and referencing these changes to a model of learning based on concepts in dynamical systems theory. Specifically, a greater understanding of the role of movement pattern variability and transitions between preferred movement patterns using refined cluster analysis procedures was an advancement of previous work in this area of study. In addition, the empirical findings provided theoretical support for a pedagogical approach, Nonlinear Pedagogy, based on key concepts in dynamical systems theory. Future studies should continue to examine coordination in multi-articular actions to provide theoretical, experimental and practical implications for understanding human movement.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">leg</field><field name="subject">movements</field><field name="subject">human</field><field name="subject">locomotion</field><field name="subject">sports</field><field name="subject">physiological</field><field name="subject">physical</field><field name="subject">education</field><field name="subject">training</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20071008.130732</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physical and chemical processes affecting the formation of alluvial gold deposits in Central Otago, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Youngson, John Hughan</field><field name="description">Alluvial gold placers in Otago and northern Southland occur at several stratigraphic horizons within the Late Cretaceous - Recent sedimentary sequence. The gold is derived ultimately from primary sources in the Otago Schist. Poor correlation between the distribution of placers and that of the known primary deposits reflects repeated recycling of gold in the present drainage network and two precursor networks, each with substantially different architecture. The previous drainage networks were inundated and buried during marine or lacustrine transgression. There has been local addition of first cycle gold and immature detritus during each recycling phase. 
 Most of the placer deposits are fluvial in origin but colluvial placers occur locally along the margins of several Central Otago ranges. Aeolian placers and marine placers are rare. Most of the gold in placers north of the Caples/Torlesse Terrane boundary is Au-Ag alloy, except in vicinity of the Hyde-Macraes Shear Zone, where &#945;-Au-Ag-Hg alloy is also present. Conversely, &#945;-Au-Ag-Hg alloy dominates in placers south of the Caples/Torlesse Terrane boundary, except those whose headwaters lie, or lay, in the Torlesse Terrane. These systems that cross the terrane boundary contain Au-Ag and Au-Ag-Hg alloys in the reach downstream of the boundary, and placers with their source in Aspiring Lithologic Association also contain both alloys. Textural and compositional maturity of the placer host generally increase with decreasing age, reach maxima at the Waipounamu Erosion Surface, and generally decrease in tandem with age above this surface. Exceptions occur in northern Southland, where quartz pebble conglomerate placers are actively forming. 
 Fluvial quartz pebble conglomerate placers have not formed in a single sedimentary cycle. Instead, they have formed from precursor sediment where a high water table drives alteration of the labile component, and when uplift and erosion rates, topography and stream gradients are all sufficiently low to drive sedimentary recycling without significant input of low-grade basement detritus. The maturity of pre-marine examples (Taratu, Papakaio and Hogburn Formations) was enhanced by wave-reworking before final inundation during marine transgression. Colluvial placers in alluvial fans at the margins of Quaternary schist antiforms are repeatedly recycled into younger fan sediments during range growth. These ranges grow in width, as well as length and height, at the expense of the intervening basins, which become progressively narrower. The colluvial placers are ultimately reworked into a fluvial placer in an axial river between two ranges, which concentrates all of the colluvial gold into an incised channel once the widening ranges meet. Aeolian placers have formed from fluvial precursors in the semi-arid parts of the rain shadow east of the Southern Alps, particularly on the lower slope of ranges exposed to westerly winds. Silcrete and less common greywacke ventifacts are commonly associated with these placers. 
 Progressive changes in gold particle shape by flattening during transport in fluvial systems has been the most important process in the concentration of gold in placers. Flattening changes the hydrodynamic behaviour of gold particles by increasing their surface area to volume ratio, thereby making them easier to entrain and enabling transport to lower energy parts of the fluvial system. Gold particle flatness determines whether transport or concentration occurs and there is a predictable relationship between particle flatness and transport distance. This relationship explains the typical occurrence of placers immediately downstream of terminal moraines, the confluence with steeper tributary streams and the mouth of incised gorges. In each case, gold with sub-critical flatness is deposited from a higher energy system or reach into a lower energy system or reach, and must be flattened to a critical state before further transport can occur. 
 Chemical mobility of gold in groundwater occurs during uplift, commonly in association with sedimentary recycling. Secondary gold overgrowths are common in some placers and stitch or overgrow transport-induced features such as folds and abrasion marks. Chemical mobilisation and re-precipitation of gold is of minor importance, however, and results in volumetrically insignificant amounts of secondary gold. Increases in gold grain size upward through the section on both the local and the regional scale does not result from gold 'growth', but instead from preservation of progressively more proximal reaches of the host placers with decreasing age.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Otago</field><field name="subject">alluvium</field><field name="subject">gold</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20071108.160736</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigation of cerebellar cell death after ethanol exposure during development</field><field name="creator">Idrus, Nirelia</field><field name="description">Binge-like ethanol exposure of the rat during the developmental period, equivalent to the human third trimester, results in a permanent loss of cerebellar Purkinje and granule cells. This study presents data that defines the temporal and lobular windows of acute cell death in specific layers of the developing cerebellar vermis following a single ethanol binge. Any resulting permanent effects on Purkinje cell number following ethanol exposure prior to postnatal day (PD) 4 are also presented. 
 Sprague-Dawley pups were randomly assigned to either alcohol-exposed (AE) (4.5g/kg/day; two feedings via intragastric intubation) or sham-intubation control (IC) groups, and treated on a single day during PD0-10. 10-12 hours after treatment, active caspase-3 immunohistochemistry detected cells that had entered the apoptotic cell death pathway. The total number of caspase-3-positive cells in the developing layers of the vermis (Purkinje cells [Pcells]; external granular [eGL]; internal granular [iGL]) were counted using the physical disector/fractionator method. Ethanol induced significantly more cell death - its acute neurotoxic effect was observed on Pcells from PD0-8; on eGL cells on PD0-3, PD7 and PD9; and on cells in the iGL on PD3 and PD6-10. Regional variability was also demonstrated on a lobular basis in each cell population. 
 A second cohort of pups was treated on either PD0, PD2 or PD4. The total number of Pcells in the adult vermis, Lobule III and Lobule IX were determined using the optical disector/Cavalieri technique. Significantly fewer Pcells were counted in the vermis of PD4-treated AE animals, and a significant deficit in Pcells within Lobule III was observed in PD2-treated AE animals. Ethanol exposure on PD2 or PD4 showed a tendency towards there being a significant deficit in Pcell number within Lobule IX, but a 10-20% Pcell loss is certainly biologically and clinically relevant. 
 No significant differences in Pcell numbers were observed in the adult rat following ethanol treatment on PD0, either on a vermal or lobular basis, despite the significant acute cell death observed. Whether the rate of naturally occurring cell death decreased following early ethanol exposure on PD0 was subsequently investigated. 
 This thesis is the first to demonstrate acute apoptosis induced by ethanol prior to PD4, which may result in permanent Pcell loss. Activated caspase-3 was detected in cells throughout the developing cerebellar cortex, indicating many cell types are acutely vulnerable to ethanol over longer timeperiods than previously recognised. This thesis also showed significant cell loss could occur in discrete cerebellar sub-regions, which may have consequences for cerebellar function. This is important to the human condition, as a single ethanol episode is all that is required to delete neurons rapidly and permanently from the developing brain.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">brain</field><field name="subject">cell</field><field name="subject">death</field><field name="subject">alcohol</field><field name="subject">physiological</field><field name="subject">effect</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20071127.162052</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Aspects of the population biology of the southern arrow squid, Nototodarus sloanii, in southern New Zealand</field><field name="creator">McKinnon, Jean Fiona</field><field name="description">Nototodarus sloanii is an important component of the Southern Ocean fauna, and the basis of a large commercial fishery. Despite this, much is unknown about the biology of this species. This study examines some aspects of the biology of N. sloanii. 
 Stomach contents analysis identified no significant differences in diet between male and female squid. Sixteen putative species, including 12 identifiable teleosts, 2 crustaceans, and 2 cephalopods were identified in the diet of this species. The euphausid, Nyctiphanes australis was the most important prey item, Lanternfish, Lampanyctodes hectoris, and Pearlside, Maurolicus muelleri, were of secondary importance. 
 Squid were aged using counts of statolith micro-increments and back-calculation from the date of capture showed that hatching occurred between August and February, with a peak in the austral winter/spring and another smaller peak in the austral summer. Growth rate for male squid differed depending on whether squid were hatched in the winter/spring or summer. Growth rates were more variable in the winter/spring-hatched individuals, and they attained larger size than summer-hatched squid. This was not the case for female squid. Mean age for immature winter/spring-hatched squid was significantly higher than for summer-hatched squid, although there was no significant difference in mean mantle length or body mass. No significant differences between mean age, mantle length, or body mass for same-gender mature squid, regardless of hatch season, were apparent. However, mature female squid hatched in the winter/spring season were significantly longer (ML) than mature male squid hatched in winter/spring. No squid was found to be older than 211 days. All squid had started to mature by 91-120 days old and all were fully mature at 180 days. 
 Validation experiments run on juvenile squid using calcein markers were inconclusive, however the increments in the statoliths were very similar to those found in other validated species of ommastrephid squid, thus for the purposes of this study they were assumed to be of daily periodicity. 
 Gladius increments identify a gender difference in growth rate, with female squid having a shorter initial slow growth phase than male squid. 
 Gonadosomatic indices (GSIs) were calculated for male and female squid. These were low (7.12%&#65533;0.3% for females and 1.9%&#65533;0.2% for males) suggesting that these squid are intermittent spawners. This is further supported by a histological examination, which found germinal cells of different stages present in the same gonad. Lack of mature individuals in this study means that these results are suggestive rather than definitive; more examination of the reproductive process of this squid is required. Histological examination was also used to validate the Lipinski maturity scale for use with this species, while some misidentification occurred the scale is useful to place squid into the broad categories of immature, maturing, or mature. New maturity scales were created for N. sloanii utilising these broad categories. Finer-scale identification is not possible using this scale, as maturation appears to be a continuous process. 
 Morphometric measurements were taken from both hard and soft tissues and were analysed using non-metric multidimensional scaling and analysis of similarity. Divisions were only apparent in the hard structure measurements. They did not appear to be age, dietary or reproductive differences.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">squids</field><field name="subject">nototodarus</field><field name="subject">aquatic</field><field name="subject">invertebrate</field><field name="subject">populations</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20071204.161531</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Structures of the pro-survival protein A1 in complex with BH3-domain peptides</field><field name="creator">Smits, Callum</field><field name="description">Protein:protein interactions are central to the regulation of the intrinsic programmed cell death (apoptosis) pathway. Opposing members of the Bcl-2 family of proteins, which have distinct sequence features, interact with each other on the outer mitochondrial membrane to regulate apoptosis. Pro-survival proteins such as Bcl-2, Bcl-x[L], Bcl-w, Mcl-1 and A1 protect cells from apoptosis and contain up to four regions of homology to Bcl-2 (Bcl-2 homology domains 1 - 4, BH1-4). Pro-apoptotic BH3-only proteins such as Bim, Puma, Noxa, Bad, Bmf, and Bid promote apoptosis by interacting with and inactivating pro-survival proteins, and contain just the BH3-domain. The pro-apoptotic proteins Bax and Bak are essential for apoptosis and contain three regions of homology to Bcl-2 (the BH1-, BH2- and BH3-domains). 
 In this study, two different sets of interactions involving pro-survival proteins were investigated. Initially, the pro-apoptotic protein Bnip3 was examined to determine if it was a mitochondrial anchor for the pro-survival protein Bcl-w. Secondly, to characterise the interactions between a pro-survival protein and different BH3-domains, structures were solved of the pro-survival protein A1 in complex with four different BH3-domains. 
 In the structure of Bcl-w, the hydrophobic C-terminus is bound to its own BH3-domain binding groove. This location of the C-terminus is consistent with the observation that Bcl-w is only loosely associated with the outer mitochondrial membrane in healthy cells. Upon interaction of Bcl-w with a BH3-domain, Bcl-w becomes tightly associated with the mitochondrial membrane, presumably due to displacement of the C-terminal residues by the BH3-only protein. In healthy cells it has been suggested that Bcl-w is associated with the membrane due to an interaction with an unidentified membrane protein, which preliminary experiments suggested may be Bnip3. Protein interaction experiments performed in vitro and in vivo did not reveal an interaction between Bnip3 and Bcl-w. 
 It was originally thought that each pro-apoptotic BH3-only protein could interact with all pro-survival proteins. However, it has recently become clear that there is selectivity within the pathway suggesting functional groupings. Bim and Puma behave as originally predicted and can interact with all pro-survival proteins and are potent killers. In contrast, Noxa and Bad interact with distinct subsets of pro-survival proteins. Noxa only binds Mcl-1 and A1, while Bad binds Bcl-2, Bcl-x[L] and Bcl-w. As a result, either Noxa or Bad acting alone is a weak killer, but together they are potent. Other BH3-only proteins bind tightly to some pro-survival proteins and weakly to others. 
 The diversity that exists between BH3-domain sequences precludes sequence-based identification of the determinants of specificity. In this study, crystal structures of A1:Puma BH3-domain, A1:Bmf BH3-domain, A1:Bak BH3-domain and A1:Bid BH3-domain complexes have been solved. Differences identified between these structures explain some of the variation in affinities observed in pro-survival protein:BH3-domain complexes. These observations, in combination with published data, suggest that BH3-domains bind weakly when the optimal interactions with conserved residues cannot be formed. Additionally, differences were observed in the A1:Bak BH3-domain structure that may be functionally important for the regulation of Bak.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">apoptosis</field><field name="subject">protein-protein interactions</field><field name="subject">proteins</field><field name="subject">metabolism</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20071218.131743</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Prognostic significance of a gene proliferation signature in colorectal cancer</field><field name="creator">Anjomshoaa, Ahmad</field><field name="description">Aberrant cell proliferation is a fundamental feature of cancer. It is thus not unexpected that many studies have been devoted to the exploration of tumour cell proliferation as a potential indicator of outcome. Indeed, in most malignancies, high expression of proliferation markers and more accurately, increased expression of proliferation-related genes have been strongly associated with poor outcome. In colorectal cancer (CRC), however, discordant results have been reported and the prognostic significance of cell proliferation has not been demonstrated in this type of cancer. As these results were mostly based on the subjective assessment of a single proliferation marker, this work set out to evaluate the association between the proliferative activity of CRCs and their malignant potential using an objective microarray-based multi-gene proliferation signature. 
 In the first step, a gene proliferation signature (GPS) was derived from analysis of a CRC cell line model. Ten CRC cell lines were harvested under semi- and fully-confluent conditions to obtain RNA from two stages that differed in their proliferative activity. Gene expression profiles of the two growth stages were analyzed on oligonucleotide arrays and a GPS was identified by gene ontology analysis of differentially expressed genes. In the second step, the performance of the signature to classify patients into prognostic groups was examined using two independent cohorts of primary CRC tumours (cohort A: 73 tumours in stages I-IV, cohort B: 55 tumours in stages I-II). Further, the signature was applied to a population of liver metastases to establish its association with the malignant potential of CRC. Finally, the capacity of the signature to detect clinically distinct CRC populations was compared with that of the proliferation marker Ki-67 in a classic immunohistochemical approach. 
 The GPS consisted of 38 mitotic cell cycle genes, which were over-expressed in actively cycling cells relative to growth-inhibited cells in vitro. Intriguingly, a reduced GPS expression was associated with (i) the presence of lymph node or distant metastasis in cohort A, (ii) an increased risk of recurrence, and (iii) shorter overall and recurrence-free survival in both cohorts of primary CRCs (p&lt;0.05). While the association between the GPS and clinical outcome was not independent of the disease stage in cohort A, reduced GPS expression was an independent predictor of outcome in cohort B. Importantly, adjuvant therapy had no impact on this association. Furthermore, GPS expression was reduced in CRC liver metastases, confirming that decreased proliferation is an indicator of the malignant potential in CRC. While reduced proliferation in liver metastases was also observed by Ki-67 immunostaining, the classic proliferation marker was not able to stratify primary CRCs into different prognostic groups. 
 To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to report an association between the reduced expression of a multi-gene proliferation signature and poor outcome in cancer. This finding contradicts the long-held belief that increased proliferation is an indicator of tumour malignancy. In contrast to many other cancers, reduced proliferation appears to be a significant component of a biological signature associated with malignant potential of CRC tumours. Investigating the reasons why CRC differs from other cancer types may provide insights into important underlying biological mechanisms. If this association can be verified in larger cohorts, the GPS may have important clinical implication for identification of high-risk early stage CRC patients.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">colon</field><field name="subject">rectum</field><field name="subject">cancer</field><field name="subject">cell proliferation</field><field name="subject">molecular</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20071218.134516</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression in Hepatitis B virus</field><field name="creator">Panjaworayan, Nattanan</field><field name="description">Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a major cause of hepatocellular carcinoma and liver cirrhosis worldwide. HBV vaccination can prevent new infections, but effective antiviral drugs are not available for a large number of HBV infected patients. To develop novel antiviral drugs, a better understanding of the regulation of HBV gene expression is vital. One important aspect is to understand how HBV hijacks the cellular machinery to export unspliced RNAs from the nucleus of a cell to the site of incorporation into new HBV particles. 
 The HBV post-transcriptional regulatory element (HBV PRE) is a cis acting RNA element found in all HBV transcripts. It has been reported to play an important role in the nuclear export of HBV mRNAs. Moreover, it has the ability to enhance expression of intronless as well as unspliced transcripts. Despite concerted investigations, the functional core element of HBV PRE remains unknown and the exact mechanism of how HBV PRE mediates nuclear export is unclear. 
 This project first produced a complete HBV genome with comprehensive annotation of both coding regions and regulatory signals, which was then used for comparative genomic analysis. The functional elements of the HBV PRE were first subjected to analysis in silico. The HBV PRE is highly conserved among HBVs. Based on this sequence conservation and prediction of conserved RNA secondary structure, potentially functional HBV PRE elements including the previously reported elements (HBV SL&#945; and HBV SL&#946;) were identified. 
 Experimental deletion analysis of the HBV PRE sequence showed that the effect of each of these elements on the intronless reporter gene&#65533;s expression was similar to that of the entire full length HBV PRE. Thus, the results suggested that overall HBV PRE function was not due to additive effects from the individual elements. Surprisingly, a specific sub-section of HBV PRE decreased the level of reporter gene expression. This sub-section has not been identified previously, thus it is a novel HBV PRE inhibitory element. Further analyses using specific reporter assays revealed that the HBV PRE enhanced expression of an unspliced reporter gene whereas the RNA nuclear export elements of retroviruses, CTE (in MPMV) and RRE (in HIV-1) were not able to. Therefore, these results indicate that HBV PRE is involved in inhibition of splicing and it utilizes a different mechanism from CTE and RRE. Interestingly, HBV PRE was observed to be unable to enhance the expression of an intronless luciferase gene. Therefore, HBV PRE is not able to enhance cytoplasmic expression of all intronless transcripts. 
 This project also addressed the idea that the RNA-binding protein, polypyrimidine tract binding protein (PTB) is a positive trans-acting factor for HBV PRE function. Transient expression of exogenous PTB in cultured cells showed no specific effect on constructs containing HBV PRE. Moreover, reduction of endogenous PTB by RNAi did not affect HBV PRE function. Therefore, the results presented in this project do not support the hypothesis that PTB plays a role in HBV PRE function. 
 Given that HBV PRE is highly conserved and present in all HBV transcripts, it makes a good target site for novel molecular therapeutic treatments such as siRNA. To identify potential siRNA target sites within HBV PRE, an RNAi study using a plasmid expressing shRNA against HBV PRE was done. The results from the RNAi study revealed that the expression of a reporter gene could be significantly reduced by siRNA targeted to the HBV PRE. 
 Overall, this project produced a highly annotated HBV genome that can be used as the reference sequence for comparative genomic analysis. Moreover, this work identified novel regulatory elements within HBV PRE that are likely to play an important role in HBV gene expression. Furthermore, the study also identified an excellent siRNA target site within HBV PRE that may inhibit HBV gene expression.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">hepatitis B</field><field name="subject">virus</field><field name="subject">genetic</field><field name="subject">regulation</field><field name="subject">transcription</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20071218.143835</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of a high throughput fluorescent screening assay for genetic recoding</field><field name="creator">Cardno, Tony Stuart</field><field name="description">The development of new drug therapies traditionally requires mass screening of thousands if not millions of substances to identify lead compounds. They are then further optimised to increase potency. The screening of the large pharmaceutical compound libraries can be incredibly expensive, with the industry responding by miniaturising the assays to smaller formats, enabling the compound screening to be automated and, importantly, eliminating assay reagents that are a major contributing cost for running large screens. 
 A potential target for such an approach is the genetic recoding site of viruses like HIV-1 and SARS. They use programmed recoding of the genetic code to regulate the translation of necessary proteins required for viable virus production. For example HIV-1 uses a -1 frameshift mechanism to regulate the ratio of the Gag to the Pol proteins, crucial for viable virus formation. 
 The study of recoding, including readthrough of premature termination codons have most recently used bicistronic reporters with different combinations of enzymes. The most widely used plasmid bicistronic reporter utilises a dual luciferase arrangement comprised of firefly luciferase and Renilla luciferase reporters flanking the DNA being studied. Both of the luciferase enzymatic reporters emit light in response to their respective substrates. The cost of these substrates is the major issue to using luciferase reporters for high throughput screening. 
 My study aimed at designing and developing a bicistronic assay suitable for genetic recoding that was amenable to high throughput screening. The luciferase reporters were replaced with Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) reporters that do not require the addition of substrates. The development of a dual GFP assay required the appropriate selection of GFP fluorophores, the best arrangement of the GFPs to maximise the ratio of relative fluorescence intensity signal to background, the optimisation of the cells and growth conditions, DNA transfection, plate reader selection, and optical filter sets. Cassettes encoding protein linkers were also incorporated into the design of the constructs to separate the fluorescent proteins spatially to facilitate unimpaired folding into their functional units within the fusion protein. The assay was further improved by moving from transient transfection to stably expressing cell lines. A viable assay was almost achieved for 96 (and 384) well plates with a Z&#65533; factor compatible with the assay being suitable for high throughput screening. 
 The assay was used to test a small collection of compounds known to interact with the ribosome and compounds known in the literature to affect frameshifting. This proof of concept was important, since it showed that the assay, with the various modifications, optimisations and miniaturisation steps, still retained the capability of correctly measuring the -1 frameshifting efficiency at the HIV-1 recoding site, and recording compound-induced modulations to the frameshifting efficiency. The compounds cycloheximide and anisomycin, for example, were shown to decrease -1 frameshifting albeit at some expense to overall protein synthesis. 
 The dual GFP assay was also shown to be able to measure accurately changes in the frameshift efficiency brought about by mutations to the frameshift element, and additionally, it would be suitable for the detection and study of compounds, like the recently reported PTC-124 (currently undergoing phase II clinical trial for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy and cystic fibrosis) that increases readthrough of a UGA premature stop codon mutation. 
 The dual GFP assay developed in this study is at most only 1/10th of the cost of a comparable dual luciferase assay, largely due to removal of assay substrates and transfection reagents. The assay has a robust Z&#65533; factor comparable to that of the dual luciferase assay, and would substantially decrease the costs of high throughput screening in situations where a bicistronic reporter is required. The HIV-1 frameshift element is such a site.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">genetic</field><field name="subject">code</field><field name="subject">fluorescent screens</field><field name="subject">drugs</field><field name="subject">research</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20071218.145806</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterisation of protein-phospholipid interactions in implantable delivery systems</field><field name="creator">Tantipolphan, Ruedeeporn</field><field name="description">Purpose: This thesis aimed to gain a better understanding of the effects of salts in modifying in vitro phase behaviour of lecithin and cholesterol solid implants and to obtain further information on in vitro protein release and stability. 
 Methods: Raman spectroscopy and partial least squares regression (PLSR) were used to investigate lecithin-cholesterol molecular interactions as a function of method of preparation. Lipid-salt interactions were studied by attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) and Raman spectroscopy using principal component analysis (PCA). In vitro release of bovine serum albumin (BSA), a model protein, from lecithin and lecithin:cholesterol implants comprising 10 and 30% NaCl and CaCl&#8322; were performed. Size exclusion (SE) HPLC was used for quantitative and qualitative analysis of the released BSA. On hydration, changes in phase behaviour and implant morphology were studied by ATR spectroscopy and light microscopy. SE-HPLC, ATR and fluorescence spectroscopy were used to evaluate the structure of unreleased BSA. Protein adsorption on lipid films was studied by flow through ATR spectroscopy. Increased amide II peak area upon recirculation of BSA in salt solutions over hydrated lecithin and lecithin:cholesterol films cast on ZnSe prisms was used to quantify the deposition of BSA onto the lipid surfaces. 
 Results: Shifts in the Raman spectra suggested the lecithin headgroup may be involved in lecithin-cholesterol interactions. Greater R&#65533; and root mean square error of cross validation in the calibration curves of physical mixing and heating (120&#65533;C) methods reflected poor mixing in these preparations. The mean absolute residue and mean Mahalanobis distance values from the physical mixing and granulation methods indicated their spectral similarity and comparable level of lecithin-cholesterol interactions. Calcium exhibited stronger affinity for phospholipids than sodium and it induced headgroup hydration and reorganisation upon binding. PCA of ATR spectra was sensitive to cholesterol addition, calcium binding and method of preparation whilst PCA of Raman spectra only differentiated the presence of cholesterol. In vitro release of BSA from implants produced from wet granulation mixtures of lecithin and lecithin:cholesterol in the absence of salt showed retention of a high monomer content and the release profiles were similar to the literature. Cholesterol increased the swelling, induced phase transformation of lecithin and, subsequently, reduced the BSA release. Salts only slightly modified the BSA release from the lecithin implants. In contrast, for lecithin:cholesterol matrices salts greatly enhanced implant swelling, induced the formation of hydrated lecithin of heterogeneous size and inhibited the in vitro BSA release. Analyses of the protein showed increased aggregation of BSA with a high retention of native structure while retained within the swollen matrices. ATR spectra suggested that salts promoted protein adsorption onto hydrated lecithin surfaces and the effects depend on salt types (NaCl &gt; CaCl&#8322;) and concentration (0.1 M &gt; 1.0 M) but not on lecithin:cholesterol surfaces. 
 Conclusion: PLSR and PCA can be used to investigate molecular interactions in the solid lipid matrices. In lecithin:cholesterol implants, salts modified the phase behaviour of lecithin which resulted in enhanced swelling, formation of hydrated lecithin of altered morphology and inhibition of in vitro BSA release.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Salt</field><field name="subject">body</field><field name="subject">metabolism</field><field name="subject">lecithin</field><field name="subject">cholesterol</field><field name="subject">proteins</field><field name="subject">Drug delivery devices</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20071218.162425</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Power and politics of organisational sustainable development : an analysis of organisational reporting discourse</field><field name="creator">Tregidga, Helen</field><field name="description">This research begins and ends with a concern for the environment, in particular with unease about current constitutions of the organisation/environment relationship. This thesis explores the discourse of organisational sustainable development examining organisational representations of sustainable development and 'sustainable organisations'. How a group of New Zealand organisations have come to (re)present sustainable development and how they have come to (re)present themselves in relation to sustainable development within a set of reports is analysed. The analysis aims to problematise the discourse and challenge such constitutions by opening out the debate surrounding the 'meaning' of sustainable development within this organisational context. The research considers the role of organisational reporting in creating and maintaining organisational legitimacy, something which is underplayed in the current literature. The thesis makes a contribution to both theoretical development and analytical method through elucidating sustainable development and sustainable development reporting from a discourse perspective. 
 Discourse (in particular the influences of Foucault and Laclau and Mouffe) both frames and informs the analysis. The discourse of organisational sustainable development is examined through an analysis of an archive of organisational reports and the context of which they are a part. The archive consists of 220 organisational reports (both annual and standalone) from member organisations of the New Zealand Business Council for Sustainable Development from 1992-2003. The texts which make up the archive were selected as they represent 'important texts' in the discursive debate surrounding organisational sustainable development. 
 Six themes employed in the discourse when representing sustainable development are identified. These themes are: 1) enlightened self-interest and the business case; 2) organisational sustainable development as a balancing act; 3) organisational sustainable development as necessary and important; 4) being sustainable: a responsibility and/or obligation; 5) the challenge and opportunity of organisational sustainable development; and 6) sustainable development: a new or old concept. Overall, 'organisational sustainable development' represents a reweaving of the discourse of organisations and accounting and the discourse of sustainable development. 'Organisational sustainable development' is shown to be organisationally focused, and generally does not challenge the traditional rational economic objectives of these organisations. 
 Representations of 'sustainable organisations' within the texts are analysed to show how organisational identities are constructed in relation to sustainable development. Five representations are recognised; 1) 'sustainable organisations' as providers; 2) organisations as leaders in sustainable development; 3) 'sustainable organisations' as responsible and committed; 4) 'sustainable organisations' as protectors; and 5) 'sustainable organisations' as accountable and transparent. How the process and practice of 'sustainability' reporting serves in constituting the identity of 'sustainable organisations' is underscored. 
 Potential effects of such discourse are acknowledged. The hegemonic potential of the discourse is recognised along with an identification of the ideologically-laden assumptions embedded within the texts. In reflecting on the discourse and its effects, the thesis concludes on a pessimistic note regarding the form of sustainable development articulated and the unchallenging nature of this form of sustainable development on the current structures of organisations and organising.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">environmental</field><field name="subject">reporting</field><field name="subject">discourse</field><field name="subject">analysis</field><field name="subject">sustainable</field><field name="subject">development</field><field name="subject">business</field><field name="subject">social</field><field name="subject">resposibility</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20071219.160116</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Aspects of a computational model inspired by immunological principles</field><field name="creator">Middlemiss, Melanie Jane</field><field name="description">Nature and biological systems have provided the basis for many computational models and systems, such as neural computing and evolutionary computation. This thesis examines the vertebrate immune system which formed the original basis for Artificial Immune Systems (AIS). The vertebrate immune system is highly complex and, for the most part, is successful at providing us with protection from harmful stimuli. Such a system is attractive as a model to inspire a computational system as it exhibits many desirable behaviours: adaptability, diversity, robustness, efficiency and multiple layers of detection. 
 There has been an increasing volume of research in the field of artificial immune systems. However, as the field has expanded, immunological analogies have been reduced at the expense of problem specific optimisation. Hence, this thesis takes a different approach and returns to the immune system which initially inspired research in this field. 
 In this thesis a set of key immunological properties based on immune system concepts and mechanisms are formalised in a model for an artificial immune system. This leads to an AIS framework that is more closely aligned with the immune system, and incorporates both innate and adaptive immune concepts. In particular, antigen presenting cells (APCs), major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules and T-cells are modelled within the framework. The differential signalling hypothesis is explored as a model for T-cell development, and provides a novel method for T-cell generation within an AIS. 
 Extensive empirical analysis is performed at an individual level to examine the behaviour of the AIS framework components. These results show that the artificial immune system components exhibit similar properties to the real immune components that inspired them. However, the MHC component of the AIS is found to be of limited value within an individual AIS. The AIS framework is subsequently extended to model a population of artificial immune systems. Further empirical analysis is performed at a population level, and MHC is found to improve the adaptability of an evolving population of artificial immune systems within a dynamic environment. 
 Such a model of immune system function is likely to be useful for immunologists, as it could provide a method of examining immune behaviour under various conditions in a cheaper and more rapid manner than in-vivo or in-vitro. Indeed, it may also provide a solution for examining properties that are unable to be tested using these traditional methods. Finally, the results of these empirical findings are discussed in terms of the relevance and applicability of immunological principles with regard to artificial immune systems for real world problems.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">immunocomputers</field><field name="subject">immune system</field><field name="subject">computer simulation</field><field name="subject">artificial intelligence.</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20071220.150157</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Detection of dentine tubule infection</field><field name="creator">Parmar, Dikesh</field><field name="description">Bacteria are implicated in endodontic infections. They not only infect the root canal lumen but also invade the dentinal tubules where they may remain untouched by contemporary chemomechanical preparation during root canal therapy. The contentious issue is whether the bacteria within these tubules contribute to secondary infections. Many studies have shown that clinicians fail to completely eradicate them during root canal therapy. At present there are no techniques available to detect the effectiveness of the current chemomechanical treatment regime within dentinal tubules. 
 It is difficult to detect bacteria within the dentinal tubules. Culturing techniques have been used routinely as they are versatile and easy to use. However, they are unable to show the distribution of the bacteria within the dentinal tubules. Scanning electron microscopy, on the other hand, shows detailed surface structure in association with bacteria. Histological examination of root dentine specimens under the light microscope also shows the distribution of bacteria within the specimen but not viability. 
 The dilemma posed by these existing techniques is that the results offer limited information; either demonstrating bacterial viability or bacterial distribution within specimens. No techniques able to show both the viability and the distribution of bacteria within the dentinal tubules have been reported to date. Fluorescent stains, in particular SYTO&#65533;9 and propidium iodide (LIVE/DEAD&#65533; Baclight[TM] viability kit, Molecular Probes Inc., Eugene, Oregon), have made it possible not only to stain bacteria but to differentiate live and dead bacteria. The combination of these two stains has yet to be applied to dental hard tissue in situ and they provide the basis for this investigation. 
 The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential of the LIVE/DEAD&#65533; Baclight[TM] stains in conjuction with confocal laser scanning microscopy in the development of a technique to evaluate the viability and distribution of bacteria within dentinal tubules. This was extended to demonstrate the application of this technique by examining three different means of root canal disinfection both qualitatively and quantitatively. 
 An important aspect of this study was to maintain bacterial viability, as well as to get maximum bacterial invasion into dentinal tubules. Results indicated that when the root canals were instrumented with Protaper&#65533; files and then irrigated with sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) and ethylene diaminetetraacetic acid with cetrimide (EDTAC), there was more bacterial invasion into the dentinal tubules than when the root canals were only irrigated with NaOCl and EDTAC. Daily replenishments of nutrients resulted in deeper bacterial invasion into the dentinal tubules. 
 Bacteria colonized the dentinal tubules up to a distance of 594 &#65533; 133 [mu]m from the canal. In the untreated tubules, 96 &#65533; 4 % of bacteria remained viable (green-fluorescent), whereas the Amoxicillin-treated tubules contained 94 &#65533; 6 % dead (red-fluorescent) bacteria. The calcium hydroxide-treated tubules resulted in 92 &#65533; 7 % bacterial death while the laser-treated tubules contained 81 &#65533; 12 % dead cells, frequently displaying an inner zone of dead cells surrounded by an outer zone of viable cells. 
 The application of the fluorescent stains combined with confocal microscopy offers a new method for assessing the in vitro efficacy of root canal disinfection regimens.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">dentin</field><field name="subject">infections</field><field name="subject">diagnosis</field><field name="subject">microtubules</field><field name="subject">oonfocal fluorescence microscopy</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20071221.115951</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Electric pulp testing of molar teeth</field><field name="creator">Lin, Jack Cheng-Wei</field><field name="description">Testing the vitality of teeth using electric pulp testers was reviewed. Two studies then investigated aspects of the application of electric pulp testing (EPT) to healthy first molar teeth. 
 Twenty volunteers with first molars free of restorations and caries were recruited. One molar from each arch was selected and rubber dam applied. The tester probe was coated with fluoride gel. Seven sites on each crown were EPT tested four times, and all threshold responses recorded. Data were analysed using one way ANOVA at the 0.01 level. The lowest response for both the maxillary and mandibular teeth was with the probe on the mesio-buccal cusp tip. Males responded at a lower level than females at the mesio-buccal cusp tip, but this did not reach statistical significance. 
 The relationship between pulp areas and dimensions on radiographs and the EPT results was investigated. Standardised bitewing radiographs of the tested molars were mounted and digitally scanned. Five measurements were taken using a computer program; crown width, the mesial and distal pulp horn heights, the area of the clinical crown, and the pulp area in the clinical crown. The four electrode placement sites with the lowest threshold from the pulp testing results were selected. Pearson correlations (2-tailed) were used to relate the measurements. There were no correlations between the coronal pulp size, pulp horn height and the probe placement site. The exception was an anomalous correlation between the distal horn height and mesio-buccal cuspal area of the maxillary molars.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">dental</field><field name="subject">pulp</field><field name="subject">molars</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20071221.140417</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mandibular two-implant overdentures : prosthodontic maintenance using different matrices with different loading strategies</field><field name="creator">Mackie, Andrew</field><field name="description">Objective: To determine the long-term prosthodontic maintenance requirements of mandibular unsplinted, two-implant overdentures, using different attachment systems and loading protocols. 
 Materials and Methods: An original total of 106 participants were randomly allocated to one of four different implant systems (Bra&#778;nemark, Steri-Oss, Straumann and Southern Implant systems). Three different loading strategies were used (2-weeks, 6-weeks and 12-weeks). A total of six different unsplinted attachment systems for mandibular two-implant overdentures were used with the four implant systems. These attachment systems included; the Bra&#778;nemark gold matrix, Straumann gold matrix, Straumann titanium matrix, Southern Implants plastic matrix, Southern Implants palladium matrix and the Steri-Oss rubber matrix. Each matrix group was allocated to one or more loading strategies and data related to prosthodontic maintenance events was collected prospectively from overdenture insertion (baseline) to year eight, according to predefined categories. Data were analysed using SPSS, and levels of statistical significance were set at P &lt; 0.05. To test for significance between multiple groups, ANOVA was used. Where a statistically significant difference existed, a one way ANOVA with Post Hoc tests was performed. 
 Results: A total of 90 participants from all matrix groups were followed for six-years and loading comparisons could only be made up to this time. The Southern palladium matrix was followed for only six-years therefore it could not be included in the eight year analysis. A total of 69 participants remained in the randomised controlled trial after eight years. Mandibular two-implant overdentures fitted with the Steri-Oss rubber matrix displayed the highest mean number of maintenance events at 32.2 (SD 14.5) followed by the Bra&#778;nemark matrix group at 28.8 (SD 12.6), the Straumann titanium matrix group at 24.9 (SD 10.7) and the Straumann gold matrix group at 12.8 (SD 8.2), over an eight year period. The Southern plastic matrix group had the lowest average number of maintenance events (8.7 SD 4.2) over the eight-year period and this was significant compared with all other groups (P &lt; 0.05). Over six years, there were no significant differences found between the number of prosthodontic maintenance events and the loading strategy used. On average, the Straumann gold matrix lasted for 3.9 (SD 2.1) years which was significantly longer than all other matrices (P &lt; 0.05) over six years. The Southern palladium (3.1 SD 1.7), Bra&#778;nemark gold (2.7 SD 1.5) and Southern plastic (2.5 SD 1.4) matrices all lasted significantly longer than the Straumann titanium (1.7 SD 0.8) and the Steri-Oss rubber (1.4 SD 0.7) matrices over six years. 
 Conclusions: Mandibular two-implant overdentures using the Southern Implants plastic cap required significantly less prosthodontic maintenance events compared with all other matrix groups. The Straumann gold matrix required significantly less prosthodontic maintenance compared with the Steri-Oss rubber matrix (P&lt;0.05). The Straumann gold matrix also demonstrated the greatest longevity compared with all other matrices (P&lt;0.05). There was no significant difference in the number of prosthodontic maintenance events of two-implant overdentures when loaded at 2, 6 or 12-weeks after implant placement. The prosthodontic maintenance requirements of unsplinted mandibular two-implant overdentures are dependant upon the attachment system chosen.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">dental</field><field name="subject">implants</field><field name="subject">mechanical</field><field name="subject">properties</field><field name="subject">prosthodontics</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20071221.142609</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Theory and practice of resecting and managing root ends</field><field name="creator">Roy, Rajneesh</field><field name="description">Contemporary methods of resection and management of the root end during apical surgery were reviewed. Two studies are reported here, one on the amount of peripheral root structure remaining after root-end cavity preparation in maxillary central incisors and canines, and the other on the effect of the dimensions of the cut root face on the size of the root-end cavities cut by experienced endodontists. 
 To investigate the amount of peripheral root structure remaining after root-end cavity preparation, three senior endodontic graduate students were asked to prepare conservative root-end cavities in thirty root-treated maxillary central incisors and thirty canines. Not a single tooth had the recommended 2 mm circumferential root dentine after 3 mm resection. Sixty two percent of the central incisors did not have a 2 mm dentine periphery around the root-end cavity preparations after 6 mm resection. 
 To investigate the effect of the dimensions of the cut root face on the size of root-end cavities, five practicing endodontic specialists prepared conservative root-end cavities in thirty single-rooted teeth each after resection of the apical 3 mm. The endodontists prepared larger cavities in larger root faces. More precisely, the cavity sizes suggested that the endodontists were suffering from the effects of a visual illusion, the Delboeuf illusion. 
 There are two major conclusions. First, the theory concerning the amount of circumferential dentine in a resected root face needs revision. Second, endodontists need to be aware of how the appearance of a cut root face can influence the size of cavities they cut.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">teeths</field><field name="subject">roots</field><field name="subject">surgery</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20071221.144604</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Acid-base and Cd&#65533;&#8314; adsorption properties of two thermophilic bacteria</field><field name="creator">Heinrich, Hannah Tabea Monika</field><field name="description">The release of toxic metal species is of concern due to their detrimental effects on the environment and human health. Industrial effluents are a major source of mobilised metal species. Suitable technologies are needed to sequester toxic metal species at the point of source. Biosorption, which is based on the passive adsorption of contaminants onto biological materials, promises to offer an effective alternative or complementary step to existing treatment methods. However, to date there has been no widespread commercialisation of the technique. This is partly due to an insufficient understanding of the complex underlying mechanisms which makes it difficult to select suitable biomass for specific remediation problems and to predict process performance. 
 This study characterised two gram-positive, thermophilic bacteria, Anoxybacillus flavithermus (BF) and Geobacillus stearothermophilus (BS), harvested at two different growth times, with regard to their acid-base and Cd&#65533;&#8314; adsorption behaviour. The aim was to investigate the metal cation adsorption properties of thermophilic bacteria which has not been studied previously, and to gain a better understanding of the interactions responsible for bacterial metal cation adsorption. Experimental techniques employed in this study included microscopy to establish cell and cell wall morphology, batch acid-base and Cd&#65533;&#8314; adsorption experiments to quantify proton active surface functional groups and Cd&#65533;&#8314; adsorption, electrophoretic mobility measurements to assess the overall surface charge of the bacteria and in situ attenuated total reflection infrared (ATR-IR) spectroscopy to reveal the chemical identities of functional groups. Chemical equilibrium models based on batch acid-base titration and electrophoretic mobility data were developed to quantitatively describe proton active surface functional groups. These groups can also interact with metal cations. 
 It was found that growth time was an important factor in all experiments with the differences between growth times often being more pronounced than the differences between the two bacterial strains. Microscopy revealed a gram-positive cell wall structure with different widths and staining behaviour for exponential phase cells of BF and BS. Stationary / death phase cells showed disintegrating cell walls. Acid-base titrations indicated that all cells possessed buffering capacity over the whole investigated pH range (pH 2 - 10). From electrophoretic mobility measurements, isoelectric points of ~ 3.2 for BF and &lt; 1.8 and ~ 4.2 for exponential and stationary / death phase cells of BS respectively were estimated. Chemical equilibrium models including a Donnan electrostatic model were derived which described both the batch acid-base titration data and the electrophoretic mobility data reasonably well, although a comparison with IR data suggested room for further improvement. In situ ATR-IR spectroscopy of hydrated bacterial cells at various pH values revealed amide and carboxyl groups and a contribution from phosphate / polysaccharide moieties. Group specific interactions with Cd&#65533;&#8314; were not detected, however, a partially reversible absorbance increase of all peaks suggested conformational changes in the presence of Cd&#65533;&#8314;. BF and BS adsorbed ~ 70 [mu]mol Cd&#65533;&#8314; (g dry bacterial)&#8315;&#65533; at pH 5 in 0.01 M NaNO&#8323;. Release of major cations occurred concomitantly with Cd&#65533;&#8314; adsorption. 
 The buffering and Cd&#65533;&#8314;-binding capacities of BF and BS were found to be comparable to those of mesophilic bacteria and ion exchange was identified as an important adsorption mechanism.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">acid-base</field><field name="subject">chemistry</field><field name="subject">thermophilic</field><field name="subject">bacteria</field><field name="subject">absorption</field><field name="subject">adsorption</field><field name="subject">heavy metals</field><field name="subject">environmental aspects</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080107.095128</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Determination of character-impact odorants in hop essential oils using hyphenated techniques in gas chromatography</field><field name="creator">Eyres, Graham Terence</field><field name="description">Hops (Humulus lupulus L.) are an indispensable component of beer, with the essential oil responsible for imparting distinctive odour and aroma characteristics to beer. However, not all character-impact odorants in hop essential oil have been identified and hop aroma in beer is still not completely understood. The composition of hop essential oil is very complex with 485 compounds currently identified in the literature, and recent research suggests that up to 1000 compounds may actually be present. Only a certain number will be present at concentrations above threshold and make a direct contribution to the odour of the oil. In addition, many important odorants are only present at trace concentrations. Gas chromatography-olfactometry (GC-O) using human assessors is the best way to locate potent odorants and facilitate their identification. 
 A novel methodology was developed to identify the character-impact odorants in hop essential oil samples using hyphenated techniques in gas chromatography. GC-O was used to locate odour active compounds and determine relative importance using CharmAnalysis[TM] according to the odour potency principle. Due to the chemical complexity of the samples, considerable co-elution of peaks occurs during single column gas chromatography (1DGC), making the detection and identification of character-impact odorants challenging. Therefore, comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography (GCxGC) combined with time-of-flight mass spectrometry (TOFMS) was used to resolve and identify compounds eluting in the odour active regions. 
 The methodology was developed in a case study on coriander (Coriandrum sativum) and wild coriander (Eryngium foetidum) leaf essential oils. During GC-O analysis of these samples it was recognised that odour active regions frequently coincide with several co-eluting compounds. To address this, a heart-cut multidimensional gas chromatography-olfactometry (MDGC-O) instrument was developed to resolve these 'co-eluting odour clusters' and determine the compound(s) responsible for the odour perception. 
 The 'spicy' character of hops is considered to be a desirable attribute in beer associated with 'noble hop aroma'. However, the compounds responsible have yet to be adequately elucidated. This character was investigated using a commercial 'Spicy' fraction of hop essential oil, selectively enriched for monoterpene and sesquiterpene alcohols. The odour active compounds in (i) the spicy fractions and (ii) the whole essential oils of four different hop varieties were compared using the presented methodology. 
 A compound with an intense 'woody, cedarwood' odour was determined to be a potent, character-impact odorant in all samples. This odour coincided with a complex region of the chromatogram where up to thirteen compounds were co-eluting. The peak responsible for this odour was determined by (i) correlation of peak areas with odour potency (Charm) values and (ii) MDGC-O. The compound was tentatively identified by GCxGC-TOFMS as 14-hydroxy-&#946;-caryophyllene, which has not previously been reported as an odorant in hop essential oil. It was concluded that this compound and other 'woody, cedarwood' odorants contributed to the 'spicy' character of the investigated hop samples. Compounds previously associated with noble hop aroma, notably caryophyllene oxide, humulene epoxides I and II, and humulenol II, did not contribute to the odour character of the hop samples. 
 Other potent odorants that were identified in the whole essential oil and spicy fractions of hops were: geraniol, linalool, &#946;-ionone, eugenol, isovaleric acid, and &#946;-damascenone. While myrcene was a moderately potent odorant in the whole hop essential oil samples, the abundant sesquiterpene hydrocarbons &#945;-humulene, &#946;-caryophyllene and &#946;-farnesene did not significantly contribute to the odour character.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">hops</field><field name="subject">beer</field><field name="subject">flavor</field><field name="subject">odor</field><field name="subject">odors</field><field name="subject">essences</field><field name="subject">essential oils</field><field name="subject">analysis</field><field name="subject">gas chromatography</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080125.143442</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Contribution of the perirhinal cortex to the firing properties of hippocampal pyramidal neurons</field><field name="creator">Lu, Xiaodong</field><field name="description">The hippocampus appears to carry out spatial memory processing and navigation. As one of the inputs to the hippocampus originates in the perirhinal cortex and the spatial behaviour is affected by lesion of the perirhinal cortex, this structure may be critical for the functioning of hippocampal place cells. To investigate this hypothesis, the firing properties of hippocampal place cells were compared between control rats and rats with perirhinal cortex lesions. 
 Rats were randomly assigned to control and lesion groups. Animals from both groups received recording electrode implantation and the lesion group rats received bilateral perirhinal cortex lesions. In experiment 1, the control and lesioned rats moved freely in an open field. In experiment 2, the control and lesion rats ran for reward in a linear track with either horizontal or vertical grating pattern stimulation along both sidewalls. These two experiments examined the spatial firing and movement-related firing properties of the control and lesion groups; and the theta-related firing properties of the two groups. In addition, experiment 2 investigated the influence of optic flow on these properties between the two groups. In experiment 3, the control and lesion rats were passively moved in the linear track with either a horizontal or vertical grating pattern on both sidewalls. This experiment examined the spatial firing and movement-related firing properties and also investigated the influences of optic flow, motor efferent and proprioceptive information on the firing properties of the control and lesion groups&#65533; place cells. 
 The perirhinal cortex lesion affected the spatial firing properties of hippocampal place cells. The place field size in the lesion group was significantly reduced compared to the control group in both open field and linear track experiments. The lesion also altered the movement-related firing properties. The positive relationship between the animal&#65533;s movement speed and place cell&#65533;s firing rate was disrupted by the perirhinal cortex lesion whether the animals freely ran in the open field or in the linear track. In the open field study, the perirhinal cortex lesion altered the theta-related firing pattern, and the lesion disrupted phase precession in the linear track experiment. Phase precession is that when a rat passes through the place field, the firing of the cell advances progressively and systematically across the phase of the theta cycle from a late to an early phase of the cycle. The lesion also induced poorer theta "quality" of the EEG recorded at the hippocampal fissure. Optic flow affected the spatial firing of hippocampal place cells. The place field size was smaller in both the control and lesion group when the animals received vertical grating pattern stimulation compared to the horizontal grating condition. Change in the levels of optic flow stimulation did not, however, influence the relationship between the animal&#65533;s movement speed and place cell&#65533;s firing rate in the control group. When the animals were passively moved in a linear track, many of the place cells of both the groups stopped firing. The remaining cells from the control and lesion groups still displayed a place field. The cells in the control group lost the positive relationship between the animal&#65533;s movement speed and place cell&#65533;s firing rate. 
 The perirhinal cortex lesion affected the spatial, movement- related and theta-related firing properties of hippocampal place cells. Change of optic flow had a subtle effect on the movement-related firing properties of the place cells. The PrhC lesion therefore disrupted motor efferent and proprioceptive input to the HPC rather than visual sensory information. Motor efferent / proprioceptive or vibrissae information may be conveyed from related cortex to the perirhinal cortex. This information may then project from the perirhinal cortex to the hippocampus directly or indirectly via the entorhinal cortex. Future studies could investigate the relationship between whisker stimulation and hippocampal place cell firing properties and further examine the possible role of motor efferent / proprioceptive signals in the firing of these cells.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">memory</field><field name="subject">cerebral cortex</field><field name="subject">physiology</field><field name="subject">Hippocampus</field><field name="subject">brain</field><field name="subject">rats</field><field name="subject">physiology</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080128.154906</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Luminance and contrast as depth cues</field><field name="creator">Govan, Donovan G</field><field name="description">It has long been held that luminance acts as a cue for depth perception. But varying the luminance of a stimulus inevitably alters its contrast with its background. Recent research shows that contrast is a depth cue. I have distinguished two kinds of contrast, external contrast, the contrast of a stimulus with its background, and internal contrast, the contrast within the stimulus. I compared the relative apparent depth of two stimuli (both directly and indirectly; stimuli were either sine-wave filled hemifields, sine-wave filled squares, or plain squares), as their luminances and internal contrasts were varied along with the luminance of their background. I found internal and external contrast to be additive effects, whereby the stimulus with either a higher internal or external contrast appeared nearer. When the internal and external contrasts of the stimuli were equated, luminance acted as an ambiguous cue, with the lighter square appearing nearer for the majority of observers, and farther for a minority. Luminance may act as a depth cues from our experience with artificial lighting (artificial light varies ambiguously with depth). Contrast may act as a depth cue from its usual association with the reduction of contrast of objects with distance through the atmosphere. I conclude that luminance and contrast are independent depth-cues that are caused by two different mechanisms.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">depth perception</field><field name="subject">brightness perception</field><field name="subject">contrast sensitivity</field><field name="subject">vision</field><field name="subject">light</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080129.112322</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Determining optimal approaches for successful maintenance of weight loss</field><field name="creator">Dale, Kelly S</field><field name="description">Objective: Since short-term weight loss is often achievable in overweight individuals but long-term weight maintenance is generally poor, this thesis examines the effect of the nature of support programmes and macronutrient composition on weight maintenance following weight loss. 
 Research design and methods: A 2x2 multifactorial design was used to compare two support programmes and two diets differing in macronutrient composition on maintenance of weight loss over a 2-year period. Two hundred women who had recently lost at least 5% of initial body weight were randomised into one of two support programmes. One provided intensive expert, health professional support with regular circuit training classes. The other provided brief and frequent &#65533;weigh-ins&#65533; and support facilitated by a nurse. Participants were also randomised with regard to recommended diet composition. One eating plan was high in carbohydrate and dietary fibre, emphasising low glycemic index foods. The second eating plan was relatively high in monounsaturated fat and protein and had a low overall glycaemic load. At baseline, 1 and 2-years, weight, waist circumference and blood pressure were measured and body composition was estimated using bioelectrical impedance. Three-day weighed diet records were collected to estimate dietary intake. A fasting blood sample was used to measure glucose, insulin and lipids. 
 Results: At 2-years weight was measured for 87% of participants. On average those randomised to the Expert Support Programme reduced weight by 2.5kg while those on the Nurse Support Programme reduced weight by 3.6kg (difference between support programmes, P=0.976). On the High Carbohydrate Diet average weight loss was 2.4kg compared with a loss of 3.8kg on the High Monounsaturated fat Diet (difference between diets, P=0.419). 
 At follow-up, there were no signficant differences between the support programmes with regards to body composition, systolic and diastolic blood pressures, blood lipid levels, glucose, insulin, and predicted insulin sensitivity. From a health system perspective and relative to the Nurse Support Programme, the Expert Support Programme cost $NZ 928, 970 per QALY gained (or $9, 290 per person). 
 At follow-up, there were no signficant differences between the dietary prescriptions with regard to body composition, systolic and diastolic blood pressures, triglycerides, HDL-cholesterol, glucose, insulin and predicted insulin sensitivity. However, total and LDL cholesterol were significantly lower on the High Carbohydrate Diet compared with the High Monounsaturated fat Diet (total cholesterol 0.2mmol/l, P=0.044, LDL cholesterol 0.2mmol/l, P=0.042). At follow-up those on the High Monounsaturated fat Diet reported significantly higher intakes of saturated fat (1.5%TE), total fat (5%TE), monounsaturated fat (2.4%), and a significantly lower intake of carbohydrate (-5%TE) than those on the High Carbohydrate Diet. 
 Conclusion: A relatively inexpensive nurse led programme appears to be as effective as a more costly expert health professional led programme in achieving weight maintenance over a 2-year period. This inexpensive and successful weight maintenance programme offers a feasible option for implementation in primary health care in New Zealand. Similarly, both dietary approaches produced comparable beneficial effects in terms of weight loss maintenance. However the High Carbohydrate Diet was associated with lower levels of total and LDL cholesterol, possibly due to a lower intake of saturated fat.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">weight loss</field><field name="subject">health aspects</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080129.122806</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Approaches to identify candidate genes for resistance to facial eczema disease in sheep</field><field name="creator">Duncan, Elizabeth Jenness</field><field name="description">Facial eczema disease (FE) is a secondary photosensitisation disease of ruminants caused by exposure to the mycotoxin sporidesmin. Resistance to FE has a significant genetic component and previous research has included a whole genome scan and investigation of candidate genes. The aim of this study was to use multiple approaches to identify genes associated with resistance to FE. 
 ABC transporters have been considered as putative candidate genes for FE since the yeast ABC transporter, PDR5, was found to modulate sensitivity to sporidesmin in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. A previous study had shown that hepatic expression of the ovine ABC transporter, ABCB1, was induced following exposure to sporidesmin but only in resistant animals (Longley (1998) PhD Thesis, University of Otago). In the present study, using qRT-PCR, a difference in the expression of ABCB1 between resistant and susceptible animals was not confirmed. It is concluded that ABCB1 is not likely to be a candidate gene for FE. 
 As the full genome sequences for several mammalian species are now available, phylogenetic analyses were used to identify the most likely mammalian ortholog of the yeast PDR5 protein. This analysis found that the yeast PDR5 protein was most closely related to the mammalian ABCG sub-family. The human ABCG sub-family has five members one of which, ABCG2, is a known xenobiotic transporter. Comparative mapping of ABCG2 indicated that it co-localised to a region of the sheep genome weakly associated with resistance to FE. The full-length sequence of ovine ABCG2 was determined and two synonymous polymorphisms were found. These two polymorphisms, together with an intronic SNP were genotyped across a panel of selection-line animals. The allele frequencies of the intronic SNP were found to be significantly different between the selection lines, providing evidence for the association of ABCG2 with resistance to FE. The hepatic expression of ABCG2 was examined but no differential expression between the selection-lines was observed. 
 Global gene expression profiling via microarray analysis was undertaken as a novel approach to identify candidate genes. Differences in gene expression were examined between nai&#776;ve and sporidesmin-dosed resistant and susceptible animals using a bovine cDNA microarray. A small number of differentially expressed genes were identified. Follow-up studies found that there were a relatively high number of errors in EST identity. Eight differentially expressed genes were selected for confirmation by Northern analysis. Six of these genes were shown to be differentially expressed, but neither the patterns nor the magnitude of the differential expression reflected that observed on the microarray. One of the six genes identified as differentially expressed was catalase, which has previously been implicated in resistance to FE. This finding validates the approach taken using gene expression profiling to identify candidate genes. 
 The final approach used in this study necessitated the development and characterisation of an in vitro system for studying sporidesmin toxicity. The system chosen was a human hepatoma cell line, HepG2. To date the only effective treatment for FE is the prophylactic administration of high levels of zinc sulphate. The mechanism of protection by zinc is unknown, but zinc is known to be a potent modulator of gene expression. Conceptually, any genes modulated by zinc are possible candidates for resistance to FE. It was shown that zinc pre-treatment could protect HepG2 cells against sporidesmin-induced cytotoxicity. Equivalent protection was provided by the addition of zinc in the presence of the transcriptional inhibitor actinomycin D, suggesting that the mechanism of zinc protection is independent of de novo gene transcription. 
 Overall, the goal of this project was to find genes to assist selection of sheep resistant to FE. Toward this goal, this research has identified several new candidate genes and avenues for investigation.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Pithomyces chartarum</field><field name="subject">sheep</field><field name="subject">diseases</field><field name="subject">genetic aspects</field><field name="subject">eczema</field><field name="subject">prevention</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080129.154845</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fine-scale ecology of alpine patterned ground, Old Man Range, Central Otago, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Scott, Matthew B</field><field name="description">This study is an interdisciplinary ecological study addressing the fine-scale relationships between plants, invertebrates and the environment in an alpine ecosystem. Alpine environments are marked by steep environmental gradients and complex habitat mosaics at various spatial scales. Regular forming periglacial patterned ground landforms on the Old Man Range, Central Otago, South Island, New Zealand present an ideal medium for studying plant-invertebrate-environment relationships due to their partitioning of the landscape into discrete units of contrasting environmental conditions, and the existence of some baseline knowledge of the soil, microclimate, vegetation and flora. 
 The study was conducted in three types of patterned ground (hummocks, stripes and solifluction terraces) on the Old Man Range. Each component of the study was sampled at the same spatial scale for comparison. Temperature was recorded in the soil and ground surface from April 2001 to March 2004 in microtopographic subunits (microsites) of each patterned ground landform. Plant species cover was sampled within each microsite; invertebrates were sampled from soil cores taken from the same locations as plant samples in April 2001 and September 2001. The two sampling occasions coincided with autumn before the soil freezes, and winter when maximum freezing was expected. 
 Fine-scale changes in the topographic relief of the patterned ground led to notable differences in the timing and duration of snow. The steepest environmental gradients existed during periods of uneven snow distribution. The soil in exposed or south-facing microsites froze first, beginning in May, and typically froze to more than 40cm depth. Least exposed microsites rarely froze. Within the microtopography, patterns of freezing at specific locations were consistent between years with only minor differences in the timing or depths of freezing; however, notable variation in freezing existed between similar microsites. 
 Within the microtopography, different assemblages of organisms were associated with different microsites. In total, 84 plant and lichen species were recorded, grouping into six community types. Species composition was best explained by growing degree-days, freeze-thaw cycles, time frozen and snow-free days; species diversity and richness increased with increasing environmental stress as indicated by freeze-thaw cycles, time frozen and exposure. 
 In total 20,494 invertebrates, representing four Phyla, 12 Classes, 23 Orders and 295 morpho-taxa were collected from 0.17m&#65533; of soil. Acari, Collembola and Pseudococcidae were the most abundant invertebrates. Over 95% of the invertebrates were found in the plant material and first 10cm depth of soil. Few significant relationships were found between diversity, richness or abundance of invertebrate taxa and the microsites; however, multivariate analyses identified distinct invertebrate assemblages based on abundance. Invertebrate composition was best explained by recent low temperature and moisture, particularly in winter; however, plant composition also explained invertebrate composition, but more so in autumn. 
 This research has shown that organisms in the alpine environment of the Old Man Range are sensitive to fine-scale changes in their environment. These results have implications as to how historical changes to the ecosystem may have had long-lasting influences on the biota, as well as how a currently changing climate may have further impacts on the composition and distribution of organisms.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Central Otago District</field><field name="subject">mountain</field><field name="subject">ecology</field><field name="subject">natural areas</field><field name="subject">mountain plants</field><field name="subject">invertebrates</field><field name="subject">plant-snow relationships</field><field name="subject">ecological surveys</field><field name="subject">Old Man Range (N.Z.)</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080130.093120</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Exploring relationships between parent companies and their subsidiaries : the case of Japanese mulitinationals</field><field name="creator">Strach, Pavel</field><field name="description">Japanese-style management and Japanese companies have been popular targets of management studies since the 1970s. Many studies have been devoted to the examination of Japanese companies in Japan. By comparison, less understanding has been achieved about how Japanese companies conduct business in their international operations and how famous Japanese management has been transferred to Japanese subsidiaries. This thesis contributes to an ongoing academic debate about the internationalization processes within Japanese multinational companies. 
 The processes involved in interaction between the parent company and subsidiaries address the research question of how subsidiaries of Japanese multinational firms perceive the relationship with their parent companies. The parent-subsidiary relationship is conceptualized within the boundaries of communication and information exchange theory. The conceptual framework creates a tool for research inquiry into the parent-subsidiary relationship. The framework conceptualizes the relationship between facilitating factors and perceived parental influence. Access to the parent company, motivation to engage with the parent company, and ability to engage with the parent company are conceptualized as factors facilitating the parent-subsidiary relationship. National/country and organizational/industry characteristics are identified as attributes moderating the relationship. Information outflow, inflow, and intraflow are derived components of the parental influence. 
 The study presented here is exploratory with findings based on two sequential comparative research stages. The Czech Republic and New Zealand, although different in terms of national and country characteristics, are argued as a suitable comparable base for conducting research within subsidiaries ofJapanese firms. In stage one, 18 Czech and 17 New Zealand subsidiaries of Japanese companies participated in a questionnaire survey. In stage two, 26 semi-structured interviews were conducted for case studies within Czech and New Zealand subsidiaries of six Japanese parent companies. The case studies provided further insights into the subsidiary-parent relationship. 
 This research seeks contribution to the internationalization literature by offering a new useful framework for the examination of the parent-subsidiary link. The self-identity of Japanese subsidiaries was found to give meaning to the parental relationship as perceived by the subsidiary. This relationship was influenced by the subsidiary&#65533;s country location, the industry in which the subsidiary operates, and the presence of expatriate management in the subsidiary. This research also found significant commonalities among the perceptions of parental influence in all Japanese subsidiaries involved in the study. The observed commonalities indicate that Japanese companies might have moved away from the internationalization processes ascribed to them by previous academic research. The change triggered by collapse of stock markets in mid-1990s has resulted to a recent reduction of expatriate staff reported little parental guidance, independence, and the strong self-identification of subsidiaries with their local environment.

The main objective of this study is to test the Enemy Release Hypothesis (ERH) by investigating the identity, prevalence and intensity of parasites in two marine species introduced to New Zealand - the recently introduced but spatially restricted Asian portunid crab, Charybdis japonica, and the longer-established Asian nesting mussel, Musculista senhousia. Host choice of a native generalist parasite presented with the non-native and native mussels, and prey selection by a native predator presented with these bivalves will be examined. This is the first study of its kind in New Zealand. 
 The parasite fauna of the only established New Zealand population of C. japonica (Waitemata Harbour, Auckland), was compared to that from (a) a population of C. japonica from its native region (Japan) and (b) to multiple populations of the native New Zealand crab Ovalipes catharus, a native New Zealand portunid. Results showed the introduced crab harboured only one species of endoparasite (a nematode), and two types of melanised lesions. Neither the parasite nor the lesions were present in the native crab populations. The native crab was host to only one parasite species, which occurred at very low prevalence, and was present in only one of the six populations examined from throughout New Zealand. Carapace width in the introduced crab was no larger than that reported in literature from its native are, but was larger than carapace widths of the Japanese sample. 
 M. senhousia was examined from five sites within New Zealand. Parasites in M. senhousia were compared with a sympatric native bivalve, Austrovenus stutchburyi, two native mytilids, (Perna canaliculus and Xenostrobus pulex) and with samples of M. senhousia from Italy and the USA where it is introduced, and Japan where it is native. Two native generalist parasites, the pea crab Pinnotheres novaezelandiae, and a copepod, were found within M. senhousia in New Zealand, but only at low prevalence. A greater array of organisms was associated with the native bivalves. No parasites were recovered from any of the overseas samples of M. senhousia, including the Japanese samples. This may be caused by the preservation medium used, but could be a true reflection of the parasite fauna in these populations. 
 The site where the two native parasites were exploiting M. senhousia was the only site sampled where two native mussels, P. canaliculus and X. pulex, also occurred. Consequently, effects of these two generalist parasites on the three mussel species were examined. In P. canaliculus, presence of native pea crabs was associated with lower tissue dry weight and greater shell depth. Shell width and depth were both greater in the presence of copepods. However, the prevalence of pea crabs and copepods was much lower in M. senhousia compared to the two native mussels, indicating some release from the effects of these parasites for the non-native species. Experimental choice tests showed that the pea crab, P. novaezelandiae, does not actively select M. senhousia as a host, preferring the larger native mussel, P. canaliculus. Rates of infection of M. senhousia are, therefore, likely to remain low in natural habitats where there are large numbers of native hosts. In addition, a generalist predator, the crab O. catharus, showed no preference when foraging on the three mussel species under experimental conditions. Thus, some predation pressure may be exerted on M. senhousia by this native crab in the natural environment. 
 Investigation of multiple populations of both native and non-native species has shown large variation in parasite prevalence and intensity among populations of each species. After examining C. japonica and the comparable native O. catharus, evidence to support the ERH was found to be weak. As the native crab was relatively free of parasites, it seems unlikely that parasite infection is important within native populations and therefore, the success of C. japonica is unlikely to be caused by comparatively greater freedom from parasites (a central tenet of the ERH). There was also no evidence for host-switching by native parasites into the introduced C. japonica population. In contrast, native parasites were present at very low prevalence in the non-native mussel M. senhousia. Length of time since introduction can be an important factor in host switching between native and introduced hosts, but unless prevalence of these parasites is high, the introduced species still escapes from enemies that could control a population. Therefore every non-native species needs to be examined using multiple populations to investigate variation in parasite fauna, prevalence and intensity, as the same species, if introduced numerous times, could potentially show contrasting results for the ERH unless multiple populations are examined.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">crabs</field><field name="subject">parasites</field><field name="subject">bivalves</field><field name="subject">size</field><field name="subject">parasitism</field><field name="subject">introducted</field><field name="subject">animals</field><field name="subject">marine</field><field name="subject">invertebrate</field><field name="subject">populations</field><field name="subject">shellfish</field><field name="subject">Charybdis japonica</field><field name="subject">Musculista senhousia</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080131.092837</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Health risk assessment and health risk management with special reference to sodium monofluoroacetate (1080) for Possum control in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Foronda, Natalia</field><field name="description">The principal use of sodium monofluoroacetate (1080) in New Zealand is to control brushtail possums (Trichosurus vulpecula). Aerial application of baits containing 1080 is the most common method used for large-scale control of possums. 
 The use of 1080 attracts a great deal of controversy, in particular the effects on the environmental, non-target species, and the potential chronic effects in humans associated with environmental exposures. Although the nature of the acute toxicity of 1080 has been known for more than fifty years, little is known of its effects on humans, in particular its chronic effects to environmental exposures. 
 A benchmark dose (BMD) as an alternative to a no-observed-adverse-effect-level (NOAEL) approach was investigated as a means to improve current health risk assessment values of 1080. Both approaches were investigated for three critical toxicological end points, namely cardiomyopathy, testicular toxicity and teratogenic effects identified from the few available critical studies. The calculated BMDs and lower-bound confidence limits (BMDLs) for the three end points were estimated using the Weibull, probit and quanntal linear models. A benchmark response (BMR) of 10% (extra risk) was chosen and the Akaike&#65533;s information criterion (AIC) was used in selecting the appropriate model. The BMDL estimates derived were generally slightly higher but comparable to the corresponding NOAEL for those same endpoints. The computed BMD&#8321;&#8320; and BMDL&#8321;&#8320; for cardiomyopathy and testicular effects were 0.21 mg kg&#8315;&#65533;bw&#8315;&#65533; and 0.10 mg kg&#8315;&#65533;bw&#8315;&#65533;, respectively. Tolerable Daily Intakes (TDIs) were derived using the NOAEL approach and the BMD methodology and applying an uncertainty factor of 3000. The resulting TDI using the BMDL were generally consistently slightly higher than those derived using the NOAEL approach. Based on the best fit of modelled dose-response data, a TDI of 0.03 [mu]g kg&#8315;&#65533;bw&#8315;&#65533;day&#8315;&#65533; is proposed for human health risk assessment. 
 Two sets of Provisional Maximum Acceptable Values (PMAV) were derived using the highest concentration of 4.0 [mu]g L&#8315;&#65533; 1080 found in water (N=1450), and using the maximum allowable concentration of 2.0 [mu]g L&#8315;&#65533; of 1080 in water for adults (0.58 [mu]g L&#8315;&#65533; and 0.94 [mu]g L&#8315;&#65533;, respectively) and children (0.23 [mu]g L&#8315;&#65533; and 0.4 [mu]g L&#8315;&#65533;, respectively). Parameters used in the derivation of PMAVs were average weight, average quantity of water consumed, and proportion of total intake allocated to drinking water. The derived adult PMAV of 0.60 [mu]g L&#8315;&#65533; is proposed in revising the PMAV for 1080 in the Drinking Water Standards New Zealand. This value is 6-fold lower than the current PMAV of 3.5 [mu]g L&#8315;&#65533;. Additional toxicology studies are recommended to meet the definition of a "complete database" and therefore estimating a more defensible TDI, and consequently a PMAV for 1080. 
 Risk management approaches are consistent with the Ministry of Health&#65533;s current precautionary approach. A PMAV of 0.60 [mu]gL&#8315;&#65533; in drinking water is recommended to consider it suitable for human consumption and that continuous monitoring be carried if the level of 1080 exceeds 50% of the proposed PMAV as a requirement for Priority 2 determinands in the Drinking Water Standards. Precautionary approach appears to be warranted and this was supported by information provided by the Public Health Units (PHU) where 1080 was permitted to be dropped onto drinking water catchments. The PHUs exercised precautionary measures by imposing appropriate conditions to suit local circumstances. As 1080 may likely remain an essential tool to contain tuberculosis spread by possums and to reduce possum damage to forests and crops until better methods of control are developed, a number of recommendations were proposed to protect public health.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Trichosurus vulpecula</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">sodium fluoroacetate</field><field name="subject">health</field><field name="subject">risk</field><field name="subject">assessment</field><field name="subject">management</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080131.145423</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Vaccine peptide delivery by virus particles</field><field name="creator">Wilson, Sarah</field><field name="description">Vaccination with immunogenic peptides offers a safe and specific way of inducing protection against pathogens, however as of yet there are no peptide-based vaccines available. The limitations on the therapeutic use of peptides are due to their poor immunogenicity and short life span in vivo. Peptide delivery systems act to circumvent these issues. The aims of this research were to investigate the ability of virus-like particles (VLP) from Rabbit haemmorhagic disease virus (RHDV) to deliver immunogenic peptides, to characterize the immune response to these particles, and to investigate whether baculovirus could also act as a delivery system. The vaccine peptides HAT (representing a T helper cell epitope) and HAB (representing the major B cell epitope) derived from the haemagglutinin antigen of influenza virus A/PR/8/34 were used as a model to investigate the ability of these virus particles to act as delivery vehicles to the immune system. 
 A scheme for the production and purification of RHDV VLP was established. Expression of the capsid protein from RHDV in a serum-free recombinant baculovirus system using suspension cultures of up to 200 ml, and separation by isopycnic centrifugation on cesium chloride gradients led to high yields of purified RHDV VLP. Up to 20 mg of pure VLP could be obtained from an 800 ml culture of insect cells infected with recombinant baculovirus. 
 In vitro testing revealed that RHDV VLP carrying the peptide HAT as a genetic fusion were processed by dendritic cells (DC), and that this peptide could be presented to induce activation of T cells. However, the purified RHDV VLP alone were not able to induce significant upregulation of cell activation markers CD40, CD86, and CD80. 
 A preliminary in vivo study revealed that when RHDV VLP carrying the HAT peptide were delivered by an intraperitoneal injection in the absence of adjuvant, the immune response to the peptide was weak, therefore the route of delivery and the use of immune adjuvants with the VLP were optimised. 
 Five different routes of delivery and two different immune adjuvants were compared. VLP were delivered through subcutaneous, intraperitoneal, transcutaneous, intramuscular and intranasal routes. Delivery of the VLP through each of these routes resulted in potent serum antibody responses. However, the strongest antibody responses were elicited when the VLP were delivered through the intraperitoneal or intranasal routes. Of these two routes, intranasal delivery gave the best mucosal responses at the lung surface, and was therefore chosen as the route of delivery for subsequent trials. 
 CpG DNA and the wild-type baculovirus Autographa californica nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV) were tested as adjuvants for the RHDV VLP. These two adjuvants gave similar results, both acting to enhance a T[H]1 type response against the VLP, characterized by significantly increased levels of serum IgG2a and enhanced IFN-&#947; production. Two approaches were then tested: using the RHDV VLP as a peptide carrier with a CpG adjuvant, and using baculovirus particles directly as self-adjuvanting carriers for vaccine peptides. 
 HAT and HAB peptides were chemically coupled to RHDV VLP. Mice that were vaccinated with these VLP mixed with a CpG adjuvant were able to raise low levels of specific antibody in the serum against influenza, and specific IgA against influenza was detected in the lung. These results indicated that, though the immune responses raised were modest, the RHDV VLP was able to deliver the vaccine peptides to the immune system. 
 HAT and HAB peptides were chemically coupled to baculovirus particles. When mice were immunized with the baculovirus carrying the vaccine peptides, they raised significant levels of IgG1 (p&lt;0.001) and IgG2a (p&lt;0.05) against influenza in the serum, when compared to peptide delivered alone. A significant level of influenza-specific IgA was also detected in the lung at 10 ng/ml in the mice that received the baculovirus coupled with peptide. Analysis of splenocyte cytokines showed that these mice also responded to restimulation with IFN-&#947; production at around 100 pg/ml. 
 This research revealed that RHDV VLP are able to act as carriers for vaccine peptides, however there are some limitations to their use with the HAT and HAB model peptides. It also showed that baculovirus can be rapidly modified to carry vaccine peptides by chemical conjugation, and that these peptides can be delivered to induce specific systemic and mucosal immunity, raising both B cell and cell mediated responses. Both virus particles have potential as components for new strategies for vaccination.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">vaccines</field><field name="subject">vaccination</field><field name="subject">immunology</field><field name="subject">microbial peptides</field><field name="subject">viral</field><field name="subject">peptide</field><field name="subject">drugs</field><field name="subject">dosage</field><field name="subject">forms</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080131.161222</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Translational control mechanisms used by the human Hepatitis B virus : an upstream open reading frame modulates expression of the pregenomic RNA</field><field name="creator">Chen, Augustine</field><field name="description">The human hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a small hepatotropic virus, which affects approximately 350 million chronic sufferers worldwide. It has a compact 3.2 kbp dsDNA genome encoding four major overlapping genes namely core, polymerase, surface and X required for its replication. The virus synthesises a pregenomic RNA (pgRNA) which functions both as an RNA intermediate for reverse transcription into the DNA genome and as the mRNA for the translation of the core (C) and polymerase (P) proteins. The core overlaps the polymerase gene and is translated at a 10 to 1 ratio. The polymerase gene translated from the P AUG codon is preceded by at least 4 upstream AUG codons (uAUGs), namely C AUG, C1 AUG, J AUG and C2 AUG. Various mechanisms have been implicated in the synthesis of the polymerase protein. This led to the currently accepted model which involves leaky scanning and a reinitiation mechanism in polymerase synthesis. 
 However, multiple sequence alignment of the pgRNA revealed a short upstream open reading frame (uORF) highly conserved at the nucleotide level in all HBV subtypes and mammalian hepadnaviruses. This previously unreported uORF, designated as C0 ORF in this study is also conserved in its position and length. Past studies have either omitted this uORF in their test constructs or ignored its potential role. The C0 ORF has a conserved weak initiation context and is located within the epsilon structure within the 5' leader of the pgRNA, required for viral encapsidation. Importantly, the C0 ORF precedes and overlaps the core ORF, which may suggest an alternative model in which the core and polymerase may be translated and coordinately regulated. 
 Fusion of the C0 ORF to luciferase showed for the first time that this uORF is translated through the detection of reporter activity (~20% of C) and also visualisation of the fusion protein via western analysis using anti-C0 and anti-luciferase antibodies. Subsequent removal of the C0 ORF implicated a role in repressing downstream core fusion protein synthesis in HepG2 cells. A similar repression was observed on J expression. 
 To study the effect of C0 on downstream polymerase translation, a pgRNA-like DNA construct was made and subsequent mutations introduced. Mutation of the C0 AUG led to an increase in initiation at the downstream P AUG. Alteration of the existing weak initiation context to an optimal context which favours stronger initiation consistently showed a potential role for C0 ORF in facilitating reinitiation at certain downstream initiation codons including P AUG. Mutations of other uAUGs preceding the P AUG were also done to better understand their roles in regulating polymerase synthesis. The removal of the C AUG markedly increased expression from the P AUG. This study revealed other internal uAUGs in-frame to the C AUG, namely the C1 and C2 AUGs are also effectively translated, further reducing availability of translating ribosomes to downstream P AUG. Indeed the removal of the C1 and C2 AUGs led to a corresponding increase in initiation from the P AUG. Initiation at the internal J AUG was also reported and its removal showed a significant decrease in expression from the P AUG, consistent with the previous model implicating reinitiation at the P initiation site after translation of the short J ORF. The inhibitory role of the 5 uAUGs prior to the P AUG were confirmed when all were removed, giving rise to translation almost equal to that at C AUG. 
 Taken together, these results suggest a new model in which the HBV C0 ORF plays a key role in controlling core and polymerase synthesis by repressing core translation and making available more ribosomes to downstream AUGs possibly facilitating translation reinitiation. In addition, the translation of the C0 ORF across the [epsilon] region may also preclude encapsidation, potentially acting as a switch discriminating the pgRNA template between encapsidation and translation. Therefore, the highly conserved [epsilon] region and C0 ORF present an excellent target for molecular based antiviral drugs (antisense oligonucleotides, aptamers, ribozymes) potentially providing new anti HBV drugs.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Hepatitis B</field><field name="subject">virus</field><field name="subject">RNA</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080130.123000</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Unexpected microfungal diversity : woody decay Lasiosphaeriaceae, Chaetosphaeriaceae and Helminthosphaeriaceae of New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Atkinson, Toni June</field><field name="description">New Zealand&#65533;s lignicolous pyrenomycete flora has been little studied. The cosmopolitan Lasiosphaeriaceae, largest and least studied family in the Sordariales, has long been noted for its morphological diversity and the artificiality of its grouping. This first systematic study of lignicolous Lasiosphaeriaceae in New Zealand uses morphology and phylogenetics to elucidate relationships within the New Zealand mycota and facilitate comparisons with relatives worldwide. Collection areas spanned New Zealand&#65533;s 13 degrees of latitude and included a range of native forest types. The novel application of recently-available molecular biology techniques allowed sequencing from single pyrenomycete fruitbodies. 
 Two new genera and 15 new species or species complexes are proposed in total. A new genus is proposed within the Lasiosphaeriaceae to accommodate an interesting new collection. Seven new species are described in the known genera Lasiosphacria and Lasiosphaeris and the polyphyly of certain Lasiosphacria taxa is discussed. Five new taxa are described within the Chaetosphaeriaceae, including a pair with surprisingly unique morphology. All are currently placed within Chaetosphaeria, but comprise part of a recently recognised long-spored clade that is sister to that which includes the type genus. Within the Helminthosphaeriaceae one new genus is proposed to accommodate an unusual new collection; and a new species described within Hilberina, but its transference to a new genus predicted as knowledge of this recent family grows. Phylogenetic results support the separation of the Chaetosphaeriaceae and Helminthosphaeriaceae from the Lasiosphaeriaceae where many of these taxa were previously. 
 The traditional morphological character of ascospore shape is shown to have little use in the delimitation of genera. More recently emphasised characters such as peridial wall structure may have more value, however the fruitbody wall of some New Zealand taxa could not be more different from their phylogenetic relatives. New Zealand taxa are noted for their frequently unprecedented morphology and/or unique genetics in comparison with other known taxa, which are predominantly from the northern hemisphere. The high levels of morphological and genetic divergence among New Zealand taxa appear to reflect extensive microfungal endemism on these relatively isolated islands; but surveys of diversity in other parts of Gondwana are desperately needed.

In bacteria, the enzyme is used to synthesize ATP when the electrochemical gradient of protons ([Delta][mu]H&#8314;) or sodium ions ([Delta][mu]Na&#8314;) is high, and the phosphorylation potential is low inside the cell. Conversely, the enzyme hydrolyses ATP to generate a [Delta][mu]H&#8314; or [Delta][mu]Na&#8314; when these gradients are low, and the phosphorylation potential is high inside the cell. This is coupled to intracellular pH homeostasis in some fermentative bacteria. The aim of this project was to determine the role(s) of the F[1]F[O]-ATP synthase in the physiology of two anaerobic extremophiles: Clostridium paradoxum, a thermoalkaliphilic bacterium that grows over the pH range 7.5 to 10, and Thermotoga maritima, a hyperthermophilic bacterium that thrives at neutral to acidic pH. These bacteria represent good models to study membrane-bound energetic processes as a function of pH and temperature. 
 The energetics of C. paradoxum growth was investigated in batch culture. Growth of C. paradoxum was inhibited by the F-type ATP synthase inhibitor N,N&#65533;-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCD) and monensin, suggesting an important role for an F-type ATP synthase and a chemical gradient of sodium ([Delta]pNa&#8314;) in the growth of this bacterium. Protonophores had no effect on the growth of C. paradoxum. Inverted membrane vesicles contained DCCD-sensitive ATPase activity and this activity was extracted using the detergent Triton X-100. The solubilized enzyme was purified 30-fold by polyethylene glycol-6000 precipitation. The purified enzyme displayed the typical subunit pattern for an F[1]F[O]-ATP synthase, but also included the presence of a stable oligomeric c-ring that could be dissociated by trichloroacetic acid treatment into its monomeric c subunits. The c-ring was purified, crystallized in 2D, and the projection map indicated that C. paradoxum contains an undecameric c-ring. The purified ATPase was stimulated by Na&#8314; ions, and sodium provided protection against inhibition by DCCD that was pH-dependent. ATP synthesis in inverted membrane vesicles was driven by an artificially imposed [Delta]pNa&#8314; in the presence of a transmembrane electrical potential ([Delta][phi]) and was sensitive to monensin. Cloning and sequencing of the atp operon revealed the presence of a sodium-binding motif in the membrane-bound c subunit (viz., Q&#65533;&#8312;, E&#8310;&#65533;, and S&#8310;&#65533;). On the basis of these properties, the ATPase is a sodium-translocating enzyme that generates a [Delta][mu]Na&#8314; that could be used to drive other membrane-bound bioenergetic processes (e.g., solute transport or flagellar rotation). In support of this proposal are the low rates of ATP synthesis catalyzed by the enzyme and the lack of the C-terminal region of the [epsilon] subunit that has been shown to be essential for coupled ATP synthesis. To facilitate future work on this enzyme at a molecular level, we developed a heterologous over-expression/production system to produce the ATPase in E. coli DK8 ([Delta]unc) in the presence of the helper plasmid pLysRARE. In future studies, this system will be used for the purification of mutant enzyme complexes. 
 Thermotoga maritima is an anaerobic hyperthermophilic bacterium that grows at 80&#65533;C and pH 7.0. Growth is sensitive to DCCD and monensin, but resistant to protonophores. These data suggest a [Delta]pNa&#8314; is indispensable for growth and a F-type ATP synthase plays an important role under these conditions. The ATPase activity was extracted from inverted membrane vesicles using the detergent n-dodecyl &#946;-D-maltoside. To investigate the role of the ATPase, the enzyme complex was purified 13-fold by polyethylene glycol-6000 precipitation, anionic exchange, and gel filtration chromatography. The purified enzyme was stimulated in the presence of low concentrations of Na&#8314; ions, and ATP-dependent uptake of &#65533;&#65533;Na&#8314; into inverted membrane vesicles was observed to be sensitive to DCCD and monensin. Furthermore, analysis of the published genome sequence revealed the presence of a sodium-binding motif in the membrane-bound c subunit (viz., E&#65533;&#65533;, E&#8310;&#8309; and T&#8310;&#8310;) and analysis of the ATPase by SDS-PAGE revealed the presence of a putative SDS-stable c-ring. On the basis of these properties, the ATPase from T. maritima appears to be a sodium-translocating enzyme. While we were unable to establish a physiological role for the ATPase, we propose that the enzyme generates a [Delta][mu]Na&#8314; that could be used to drive other membrane-bound bioenergetic processes (e.g., solute transport or flagellar rotation). To improve purification and yield, the atp operon was cloned to allow the heterologous over-production of the ATPase. No expression of the ATPase (F[1]F[O]) could be achieved in E. coli BL21(DE3)-CodonPlus, C41(DE3) or E. coli DK8 ([Delta]unc). However, the overproduction of the F&#8321;-ATPase utilizing the helper plasmid pLysRARE was succesful and the enzyme was purified 18-fold by heat precipitation, followed by anionic exchange and gel filtration chromatography, yielding a specific activity of 2.5 U/mg. This complex will be used in the future to investigate the biochemical properties of an F&#8321;-ATPase from a hyperthermophilic anaerobe.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">bacteria</field><field name="subject">physiology.</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080207.135137</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cruising with containers : a qualitative investigation of the lived experience of passenger freighter travel</field><field name="creator">Szarycz, Gregory Simon</field><field name="description">This thesis is the result of a preliminary investigation into a niche market segment of the maritime tourism economy. Travel by working class freighter or cargo ship is not a new activity; however, the concept of freighter-based tourism (wherein participants travel by container ship in their free time solely for leisure purposes) has emerged relatively recently on the tourism spectrum. A major cause of its recent popularity and allied growth is the positive word of mouth promotion which has been generated by people who try freighter cruising and like it. As the number of prospective travellers increases, merchant shipping lines are seeing dramatic changes in the makeup of their passenger lists. In former years, the typical freighter 'passenger' spanned all ages and walks of life, as thousands of European immigrants traversed the Atlantic in search of a new life in the Americas. Today&#65533;s freighter 'travellers' are almost always over 50 years of age (up to a maximum age of 79) and are, for the most part, affluent with time and money to spare. Freighter travel nowadays involves the movement of people solely for the purpose of a unique and atypical travel experience. 
 The purpose of this qualitative study was to explore the experiences of 22 participants engaged in recreational travel aboard working container vessels/cargo ships. The research questions driving this study were: What expectations and factors are understood by passengers to influence their decision to choose this particular mode of transport? What is the nature of the freighter experience, as passengers themselves understand it? What meanings do passengers attach to their experiences? How do the temporal dimensions of the passenger freighter experience (before, during, and after) connect with each other? 
 This study employed a qualitative methodology to capture and portray as vividly as possible the participants&#65533; experiences and their attempts to make sense of those experiences. A phenomenological case study research design, set within a symbolic interactionist analytical framework, guided the study. The data consisted of in-depth online interviews and document analysis in the form of unsolicited travelogues/journey diaries. Through a prolonged and iterative process of data analysis using the transcendental phenomenological model provided by Moustakas (1994) and the operational refinements suggested by Schutz (1970) and Kvale (1995), the researcher documented the 'lived experience' of travel by cargo ship from the individual travellers&#65533; perspectives. Further, as a tool for describing, analysing, and interpreting the data, this study utilised the 'generic social processes scheme', a sociological method for the purposes of organising, analysing and interpreting qualitative data (Prus 1996). Within this research the themes were presented collectively, although they were systematically identified separately. 
 The shared themes, meanings and patterns that shaped the informants&#65533; travel narratives suggested that moving out to the unfamiliar can be frightening, or it can be liberating. Participants had assessed and realistically accepted the potential hazards of a freighter voyage, working on the assumption that a willingness to roll with uncertainty, unexpected delays, and mishaps is mandatory. Associated with these themes were issues of adaptation; dealing with challenges, ambiguities and constraints, which, despite their potential to preclude further similar such involvements, shaped the overall freighter travel experience and did not affect participants&#65533; satisfaction with the experience. 
 It was further shown that freighter travellers are highly individualised people characterised by their interest in unique 'life experiences' and defined by their search for the 'extraordinary'. Participants framed their behaviours as an extension of themselves; their self-designation as 'travellers' and not 'tourists' and their emphasis on independence and autonomy conferred a sense of individuality and personal determination. Like Cohen&#65533;s (1976) non-institutionalised, unstructured tourists, these 'travellers' valued risk, adventure and novelty. 
 The idea of negotiation through ambiguity and occasional setbacks in their travels further challenges commonly held perceptions about constraints, which, too often is seems, have been construed as obstacles or barriers (Jackson 2000) to travel. With regard to the present study, constraints, while inherent to freighter travel, would not have represented a full or accurate picture of the travellers&#65533; experiences without a concomitant description of how they were negotiated; moreover, the process of their negotiation repositions these travellers as active participants (instead of inactive consumers) of the tourist experience. These travellers decided what they wanted to do, where they wanted to go, and ensured they could negotiate their constraints to do so. 
 The conclusive findings of this study suggest that freighter travel was viewed largely as a positive, beneficial, and rewarding experience, offering opportunities for self-development, reflection, social interaction, and cross-cultural immersion and learning. While certain constraints and limitations were acknowledged and recognised, freighter travellers negotiated through them, and fully enjoyed participation in the travel experience.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ocean</field><field name="subject">travel</field><field name="subject">cargo</field><field name="subject">ships</field><field name="subject">passenger</field><field name="subject">traffic</field><field name="subject">older people</field><field name="subject">tourism</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080208.140410</field></doc><doc><field name="title">There and back again - comparative case studies of film location tourists&#65533; on-site behaviour and experiences</field><field name="creator">Roesch, Stefan</field><field name="description">Over the last decade, film location tourism has been established as a niche segment in the tourism industry. While this niche has attracted attention from both researchers and marketers alike, not much knowledge has been accumulated about the tourist encounter itself. It is the main purpose of this thesis to research on-site behavioural and experiential aspects of the film location encounter. 
 For the overall research design, an inductive, comparative case-study approach was implemented. Three cases were selected for this research: The Lord of the Rings locations in New Zealand, The Sound of Music locations in Austria and Star Wars locations in Tunisia. The applied methods are participant observation, image-based data and semi-structured interviews. The data collection was conducted while participating in organised film location tows in order to secure access to the informants. 
 The first fundamental outcome of this research is that there is no 'film location tourist' as such. People who travel to film locations come from different socio-economic backgrounds, comprise all age groups and possess varying degrees of fandom. The majority of film location tourists, however, have one thing in common, regardless of the underlying movie genre: the longing to connect with the imaginary world of the film by visiting the physical and thus 'real' location places. These places are consumed in two ways: as places of spectacle and as sacred places. 
 The nature of the location consumption is dependent on a number of factors, including the degree of fandom of the consumers, the attractiveness of the encountered locations, the consistency of the interpretive community, the amount and nature of external distortions and, if applicable, the structure of the location tour. Means of consumption of film locations as spectacle are formal posing, sight recordings and shot re-creations. When experiencing film locations as sacred places, shot re-creations, mental simulations and filmic re-enactments occur. The latter form of consumption can result in a symbiosis between the imaginary and the real place component: the gazing subject becomes the previously (photographed) object. 
 Regardless of the degree of experiential satisfaction, film location tourists want to bring some of the magic back home. This is achieved not only via mental pictures and physical photographs, but also through souvenirs. These can be off- or on-site. Regarding the latter, these souvenirs are almost holy relics, brought home from a successful pilgrimage and subsequently framed and displayed in an altar-like fashion. The benefits from this are not only self-pride and satisfaction, but also the distinction to other movie fans who have not been able to do the journey themselves. Thus, the person in possession of such a relic gains privileged status amongst peers which in turn raises the satisfaction with the location encounter. 
 The film location experience cycle comes to a full closure by re-watching the movie. This procedure involves a renewed connection to both the imaginary filmic places as well as the real locations visited. The filmic gaze is extended, as the movie scenes are now seen as part of a real place which extends beyond the filmic sight.

This is because of a lack of fossil evidence and complex restructuring by anthropogenic factors, especially increased fire frequency, and more recently mammalian grazing. There is also little information regarding the effect of the lost fauna on maintaining and structuring presettlement communities, both in Central Otago and throughout the eastern South Island dryland zone. This study aims to provide a clearer understanding of the functioning of pre-settlement ecosystems in dryland Central Otago, particularly the role of the largest vertebrate herbivores, the moa (Aves: Dinornithiformes), and to explore the implications of the extinct fauna for land conservation management across New Zealand. 
 Late Pleistocene and Holocene vegetation communities of the Central Otago lowlands were reconstructed from plant macrofossils, including seeds, leaves, and wood, excavated from rockshelter, cave, and swamp deposits throughout the region. The macrofossils represent three main vegetation types: late Pleistocene to mid (late?) Holocene basin floor wetland herb associations, Olearia-shrublands surrounding these wetlands, and mid to late Holocene open scrubland and woodland in gorges and on low altitude slopes, dominated by filiramulate Olearia, Coprosma, and Corokia, with abundant lianes (Muehlenbeckia spp. and Rubus spp.) and understorey herbs. Many native tree and shrub species that are presently widespread in the Central Otago lowlands were rare or absent prior to anthropogenic fires (e.g. Discaria toumatou, Kunzea ericoides, Leptospermum scoparium). Other tree and shrub species once present are now extinct in the region (e.g. Coprosma obconica, Plagianthus regius, Pseudopanax ferox). The loss of these indigenous woody vegetation communities was a major factor contributing to the extirpation of many small bird species, and undoubtedly also reptile and invertebrate species, from the region. 
 Plant macrofossils from rockshelters included remains of bird nests, identifiable by desiccated feathers and eggshell amongst them. These macrofossils include the first described plant remains from the nests of moa, which were constructed from a shallow bed of twigs of locally available shrubs and lianes. Many of the twigs are 25-30 mm in length and show evidence of having been clipped by moa bills. 
 Desiccated coprolites, mostly of moa, but also specimens attributed to Finsch&#65533;s duck (Chenonetta finschi) and red-crowned parakeet (Cyanoramphus novaezelandiae), were recovered from rockshelter excavations. Moa species associated with a sample of coprolites were identified using ancient DNA analysis, and plant macrofossils from these were examined, together with previously unexamined moa gizzard content samples excavated from mires in the eastern South Island dryland zone. The results indicate that, in addition to previously reported browsing, upland moa (Megalapteryx didinus) and heavy-footed moa (Pachyornis elephantopus) also functioned as grazers, and seeds in their coprolites are dominantly of low shrubs and ground-cover herbs. Of particular interest was the higher than expected frequency of seeds from the currently rare and threatened 'spring annual' herbs; Ceratocephala pungens and Myosurus minimus subsp. novae-zelandiae (Ranunculaceae), suggesting further research on potential ecological relationships between moa and these plants would be worthwhile. The results of this study have provided a baseline for future conservation and restoration projects in the Central Otago lowlands.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Central Otago District</field><field name="subject">paleoecology</field><field name="subject">arid regions ecology</field><field name="subject">fossil birds</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080211.142212</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies of genes associated with telomere maintenance mechanisms in gliomas</field><field name="creator">Chen, Yu-Jen</field><field name="description">The overall survival for patients with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) has not improved in two decades. A better understanding of the molecular basis for gliomagenesis would aid therapeutic advances. Recombinational based alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) is a telomere maintenance mechanism (TMM) distinct from telomerase, which serves as a prognostic factor in GBM. In this thesis, I have compared components of the p53 axis, namely p53, p21[WAF-1] and the paired box-containing transcription factors (PAX) PAX2, 5, and 8, with TMM in gliomas. 
 Analysis of TP53 status in relation to TMM in 110 gliomas revealed that activation of ALT during tumorigenesis possibly requires loss of normal TP53 function (P &lt; 0.0001). Overexpression of p21[WAF-1] was also found to correlate with telomerase-positive gliomas (P = 0.0002). Moreover, high p21[WAF-1] expression is a poor prognostic factor in patients under 56 years (P = 0.015). Telomere length (TL) was also found as a prognostic factor, such that short TL (&lt; 5 kb) is a poor prognostic factor in the group without defined TMM ("None")(P = 0.0160). 
 Pax2,5 and 8 belong to Group II of the PAX family. They are expressed at the midbrain-hindbrain boundary (MHB) and in the neural tube of the vertebrate embryo, whereas their expression levels are low in the adult brain. To explore their roles in glioma pathology, I analyzed mRNA levels in 54 gliomas and 16 established glioma cell lines. Increased levels of PAX8 mRNA were detected in 74.1% of gliomas and 62.5% of established glioma cell lines by real time PCR. Sixty-six percent of glioma specimens expressed high levels of active PAX2, 5, and 8 by immunohistochemistry. There were more males than females having high PAX2 expression (P = 0.0408). Suppression of PAX8 by small interfering RNA induced glioma cell death, independent of TP53 status. These findings identify PAX8 as a survival factor for GBM, and PAX2, 5, and 8 expression as contributing to the aggressive behavior of gliomas. 
 The mRNA level of PAX8 showed a positive correlation with telomerase activity in glioma biopsies (r&#65533; = 0.75, P &lt; 0.001). The relationship was explored and I found that PAX2 and PAX8 are able to activate the reporter constructs of both the catalytic subunit (hTERT) and the RNA component (hTR) of telomerase. PAX8 had a stronger effect than PAX2 on the activation of the hTERT and hTR promoters. By electrophoretic mobility shift assay, Western blotting and telomerase activity assay, I showed that PAX8 bound directly to hTERT and hTR promoters, and upregulated hTERT protein and telomerase activity. Moreover, gliomas carrying wild type TP53 had higher levels of PAX8 expression compared to those with mutant TP53 (P = 0.0075) suggesting that PAX8 is significant only in some GBMs during gliomagenesis. These results show that the oncofetal proteins, PAX2 and PAX8, may have roles in telomerase regulation. 
 Taken together, molecular markers examined in this thesis suggest gliomas with different TMMs are derived from different pathways.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">telomere</field><field name="subject">microbiology</field><field name="subject">gliomas</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080211.155343</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Synthesis and characterisation of probes that influence mitochondrial function</field><field name="creator">Blaikie, Frances H</field><field name="description">The production of reactive oxygen species by mitochondria is implicated in mitochondrial dysfunction associated with a range of diseases and ageing. In addition, reactive oxygen species produced by mitochondria are involved in redox signalling pathways that modulate a number of cell processes. Mitochondria targeted antioxidants comprised of an antioxidant moiety linked to a lipophilic triphenylphosphonium cation have recently been used to decrease oxidative damage to mitochondria and to investigate the involvement of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species in redox signalling. These lipophilic cations are selectively accumulated by mitochondria within cells due to the mitochondria membrane potential. This thesis presents the synthesis and characterization of mitochondria targeted membrane uncoupler, cyclic nitroxide and alkyl thionitrite derivatives, all of which had the potential to influence reactive oxygen species. The biological analysis of these compounds is also presented. 
 A triphenylphosphonium derivative of the membrane uncoupler 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP) was anticipated to act as a self regulating protonophore. The DNP moiety would influence the scale of the membrane potential while the triphenylphosphonium cation would respond to the membrane potential. These two factors would combine so that as the membrane potential was dissipated by the uncoupler, the phosphonium cation would be released from the mitochondria and the effect of the uncoupler would thereby be nullified until the membrane potential had increased again. The compound was prepared by nitration of 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propyl triphenylphosphonium bromide. An untargeted derivative was also prepared by nitration of 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-1-propanol. Unfortunately, while this compound had appropriate acidity and lipophilicity to act as a membrane uncoupler, and did enter mitochondria in response to the membrane potential, it did not act as an uncoupler. 
 A chemically stable targeted cyclic nitroxide based on Tempol was prepared following literature procedure, although other synthetic routes were also trialled. This compound was shown to concentrate in mitochondria in response to the membrane potential, was reduced by ubiquinol of the coenzyme Q pool, acted as a superoxide dismutase mimetic, and protected membranes against lipid peroxidation. 
 A mitochondria targeted thionitrite or nitric oxide (NO) donor was anticipated to exhibit an effect on respiration at low oxygen concentrations as the released NO interacted with aspects of the respiratory chain. The alkyl thionitrites were synthesised from appropriate thiol precursors, several of which were prepared. Two targeted alkyl thionitrites were prepared with primary or tertiary carbon arrays next to the thionitrite functionality. Another targeted thionitrite, based on S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP), was also prepared. These compounds were difficult to characterise because of issues surrounding their stability. However, modified high resolution positive ion electrospray mass spectrometry in combination with HPLC and NMR was used to identify the compounds and to gauge the purity of the samples. Initial biological investigations verified that the primary alkylthionitrite derivative accumulated in mitochondria, released NO, and had an effect on respiration at low oxygen concentrations.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">mitochondria</field><field name="subject">metabolism</field><field name="subject">mitochondrial pathology</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080212.091116</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cryostability of large unilamellar vesicles in relation to the effect of cryoprotective agents on ice matrix</field><field name="creator">Siow, Lee Fong</field><field name="description">Freeze-injury at the plasma membrane level has been identified as being crucial for the survival of living matter. Since plasma membranes consist of several micro domains that make the structure rather complex, this study attempted to use simple model membranes to investigate the changes of phospholipid bilayers at sub-zero temperatures. Egg yolk L-&#945;-phosphatidylcholine (EPC) and 1, 2-dipalmitoyl-rac-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC) that mimic plasma membranes in their unique ways were used to prepare large unilamellar vesicles (LUV), which were the model membranes of this study. 
 At cooling rates of 0.5 and 10&#65533;C/min, LUV were freeze-concentrated in the unfrozen matrix as a result of the advancing extraliposomal ice front and the decreasing phase volume of the unfrozen matrix, both of which led to membrane lesion. At the slow cooling rate of 0.5&#65533;C/min, an additional freezing stress imposed by the osmotic gradient across the bilayers, due to the increase of solute concentration in the unfrozen matrix, promoted leakage of LUV. 
 The gel-liquid crystal phase transition temperature of phospholipids played an important role in determining if the LUV could withstand freezing stress when the LUV were held at a defined sub-zero temperature for a given period of holding time. EPC LUV were more leaky than DPPC LUV when they were held at the high sub-zero temperatures and their leakage increased with increasing holding time. The leakiness of EPC LUV could be related to the fluid and deformable nature of the EPC above its phase transition temperature. In contrast, DPPC LUV with a higher gel-liquid crystal phase transition temperature compared to EPC may become increasingly fragile at lower sub-zero temperatures, which led to the increase of leakage when the DPPC LUV were held at the lower sub-zero temperatures. These results indicated that the determination of the fatty acid profile of the plasma membranes was essential to aid in developing the most suitable holding temperature and time during the cryopreservation of biological specimens. Adding to the integrity of LUV that depended on the gel-liquid crystal phase transition temperature of phospholipids, intraliposomal ice formation also depended on the phase transition temperature of phospholipids. Intraliposomal ice formation was only observed for DPPC LUV but not for EPC LUV. 
 In addition to the extraliposomal ice formation, other physical changes such as the eutectic crystallization of sodium chloride (NaCl) and ice mixture on the stability of LUV were also investigated. The eutectic crystallization of NaCl/ice mixture was governed by the intra- and extraliposomal distribution of NaCl and was more likely to occur at the physiological NaCl concentrations compared to lower NaCl concentrations. The eutectic crystallization of NaCl/ice mixture further increased the leakage of LUV. 
 The understanding of the freezing behaviour and the mechanisms of freeze-injury of LUV allowed the use of the current model membranes for further investigations of the cryoprotective actions of cryoprotective agents (CPA). Partial phase diagrams of sugar-salt-water, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)-salt-water and ethylene glycol (EG)-salt-water systems that resembled extraliposomal solute compositions were constructed and the phase volume of ice and unfrozen matrix was estimated from the freezing curves. Ice reduction was the major mechanism by which the non-permeable and permeable CPA protected the LUV from freeze-injury. Other cryoprotective mechanisms of the non-permeable and permeable CPA through the dilution and spacing out of the LUV in the unfrozen matrix as well as the suppression of the eutectic crystallization of NaCl/ice mixture were not ruled out. Non-permeable CPA were more effective in preventing leakage of DPPC than EPC LUV. Unlike the non-permeable CPA, permeable CPA were more effective for EPC than DPPC LUV that had been subjected to freezing and thawing processes. At room temperature, however, DMSO and EG were detrimental to the stability of DPPC LUV. The choice of CPA is strictly dependent on the type of phospholipids that varied in their acyl chain length and phase transition temperature. 
 In summary, this study provides insights of the freeze-injury of LUV and the cryoprotective mechanisms of the non-permeable and permeable CPA which are beneficial to the field of cryopreservation that often depends on empirical trial and error methods. By integrating a comprehensive molecular-based understanding, an optimal cryopreservation procedure could be designed.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ice</field><field name="subject">microbiology</field><field name="subject">ice crystals</field><field name="subject">cryobiology</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080213.110706</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A case study of HIV/AIDS prevention in Nigeria : assessment and recommendations</field><field name="creator">Iyiani, Christian</field><field name="description">This is a two-stage study of HIV/AIDS prevention. In Stage One, the study examines the HIV/AIDS approach of Western aid organisations (INGOs) and compares it to the lived realities of people who are most 'at risk', sex workers, unemployed street youth, and married low income families, in the poor migrant community of Ajegunle in Nigeria&#65533;s Lagos state. The study found that INGOs and their client NGOs emphasised Western medical models of HIV/AIDS for both intervention (e.g. testing and ARV drugs for management) and prevention (e.g. through education and behaviour change). 
 In contrast, among 'at-risk' groups, the study revealed a high degree of knowledge about the transmission of HIV/AIDS (contrary to Western medical assumptions), but also detected strong feelings of powerlessness in being able to address it. INGOs and their client organisations were operating at the levels of tertiary or curative and secondary or behaviour change prevention, whereas the views of the local 'at-risk people' indicated relevance of the primary prevention level, the social structural conditions of the people. 
 In analysing the results of the first stage of the study, the findings identified a process of 'talking past each other' by official aid agencies and those most at risk, thereby inhibiting effective prevention. The INGOs and NGOs used their financial power, based on the gross inequality in the world distribution of resources, to dictate their own agendas, omitting primary intervention and instead concentrating on secondary and tertiary prevention. The study suggests that new thinking about multi-sectoral responses with full community participation is necessary in order to engage in more effective preventive action. 
 The study then sought out alternative sources of power that might permit that to happen, notably the strengths of the local Ajegunle community. As a poor community, they lacked financial resources and human capital, such as skilled workers, but they had significant knowledge capital about their own circumstances and the realities people faced. The community also had considerable cultural capital and local organisations with considerable relational capital around community links, broad based support and commitment to such action. 
 This analysis suggests the need to identify and work through the power differentials using community development processes, especially seeking to empower local communities to take part in decision-making over prevention, if effective action is to take place. The process required is one of a negotiated, inclusive partnerships for sharing information, experience, and decision-making, involving all the relevant stakeholders - the International Organisations (INGOs), National NGOs, Community Groups and the community itself.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">AIDS (disease)</field><field name="subject">Nigeria</field><field name="subject">Lagos State</field><field name="subject">prevention</field><field name="subject">HIV infections</field><field name="subject">preventive</field><field name="subject">health</field><field name="subject">services</field><field name="subject">promotion</field><field name="subject">public health</field><field name="subject">humanitarian</field><field name="subject">assistance</field><field name="subject">non governmental</field><field name="subject">organizations</field><field name="subject">international</field><field name="subject">agencies</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080213.112805</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Conservation biology of New Zealand sea lions (Phocarctos hookeri)</field><field name="creator">Childerhouse, Simon</field><field name="description">New Zealand sea lion (Phocarctos hookeri) is a pinniped endemic to New Zealand and is among the rarest of sea lion species. New Zealand sea lions are incidentally caught in the trawl fishery for squid around the Auckland Islands, and a sea lion catch-limit or Fishing Related Mortality Limit (FRML) is used to manage this interaction. Since 2003 such limits have been calculated using an age-structured Bayesian population model. One problem with this approach is that several key demographic parameters have had to be assumed, or are based on very few data. 
 Archaeological and other historical records demonstrate that New Zealand sea lions were substantially more widespread before the arrival of humans to New Zealand than they are today (Chapter 2 published as Childerhouse &amp; Gales 1998). The present population size is clearly reduced, with subsistence and commercial hunting the most likely cause of historical changes in distribution and abundance. Campbell Island, the only significant breeding site outside the Auckland Islands, was thoroughly surveyed for New Zealand sea lions for the first time in 2003. An estimated 385 pups were born there, comprising 13% of the total pup production for the species for 2003 (Chapter 3 published as Childerhouse et al. 2005). 
 This thesis provides the first robust estimates of several demographic parameters for New Zealand sea lions. These data were gained via the capture, tagging and ageing of 865 individual females, which had come ashore to pup between 1999 and 2001. This research was underpinned by the development of a novel and robust ageing technique for live New Zealand sea lions (Chapter 5 published as Childerhouse et al. 2004). 
 Chapters 6, 7 and 8 used analyses of the age structure of these females, and of subsequent resightings of them, and of known-age females between 1998 and 2005, provided the first estimates of individual growth, mean reproductive rate (0.67, SE = 0.01), mean adult survival (0.81, SE = 0.04), and maximum age (28 years) for females. These data show that New Zealand sea lions are among the slowest growing, slowest reproducing, and longest lived sea lion species. Significant differences in the age structure of the two largest breeding colonies highlight flawed assumptions of the current management approach. The application of this new demographic information has the potential to significantly alter the existing management advice relating to the setting of FRMLs and the impact of the squid fishery on the New Zealand sea lion population. 
 Taken alone, these results suggest a dim outlook for an already threatened species. In the context that pup production is in significant decline (e.g. 32% since 1998 Chilvers et al. 2007), the species&#65533; foraging environment is thought to be marginal (Costa &amp; Gales 2000), and that resource competition may also be impacting on the population (Chapter 4 published as Childerhouse et al. 2001a), the picture darkens further. Taken as a whole, these data suggest that current management is insufficient to ensure population stasis, let alone meet the Government&#65533;s statutory goal of recovery.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">sea lions</field><field name="subject">Hooker's sea lion</field><field name="subject">conservation</field><field name="subject">biology</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080213.144055</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Care ethics and brain injury</field><field name="creator">Butler, Mary</field><field name="description">It is generally supposed that a supportive family can have an influence on outcomes for an adult with severe brain injury, but there is very little known about what effective families actually do. In this research the families of five such individuals were involved in an ethnographic project that lasted for one year. 
 The literature review brought together insights from brain injury, care ethics, disability studies and anthropology. These insights were combined with a process of reflective equilibrium that was applied to the ethnographic material in order to determine the ethics of the carers. Ethics of care in this setting was conceived of as a positive practice ethic, rather than as a series of negative conundrums posed by the brain injury. 
 The practice ethic shared by carers meant that they all conceived of the need created by brain injury in humanistic terms, rather than in terms of pathology. Carers demonstrated virtues appropriate to their practice as they helped the adult with brain injury to connect with aspects of ordinary life. The best outcomes for the adult with brain injury included being able to engage in productive activity and to make a place in the world. These outcomes could only be achieved with due regard for their safety and subsistence. The practice ethic of carers was demonstrated in the skills and concern that ensured a satisfactory outcome for the adult with brain injury. 
 This research is a departure from recent research about families affected by brain injury, which has focused on the burden involved in care. An examination of what carers achieve suggests that burden may be associated with the development of caring practice. The transformative capacity of care, for both the carer and the adult with brain injury, is emphasized. However contextual factors, such as adequate compensation, are connected to the capacity of the carer to engage in good practice and these are explored also in this thesis. In particular, relevant aspects of the relationship between families and the Accident Compensation Corporation are explored.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">brain</field><field name="subject">wounds</field><field name="subject">injuries</field><field name="subject">patients</field><field name="subject">care</field><field name="subject">rehabilitation</field><field name="subject">family relationships</field><field name="subject">caregivers</field><field name="subject">nursing</field><field name="subject">ethics</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080214.134301</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Creation and investigation of a versatile Rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus-like particle vaccine</field><field name="creator">Peacey, Matthew</field><field name="description">There is a need to develop a range different VLP for use as nanoscale templates and vaccines. The aim of this research was to develop RHDV VLP as a versatile vaccine delivery system easily modified for use against a wide range of different diseases. 
 Production of Rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV) capsid protein in a baculovirus system led to the self-assembly of Virus-like Particles (VLP) that could be purified to greater than 99% purity using simple methods. The capsid gene, vp60, can be manipulated genetically to incorporate immunogenic peptide sequences or a functional DNA-binding site. Fusion of these small epitopes to VP60 was well tolerated, forming VLP and greatly enhanced the presentation of peptide to, and activation of CD4+ T helper cell hybridoma. To avoid constraints imposed on chimeric VLP and dramatically increase the versatility of RHDV VLP, rapid conjugation of antigen was carried out, employing the hetero-bifunctional chemical linker, sulpho-SMCC. Incorporation of sulfhydral groups by design or treatment with SATA allowed for great versatility, in turn enabling many diverse peptides and proteins to be conjugated to VLP. 
 RHDV VLP and consequently the conjugated GFP antigen were efficiently taken up by DC with more than 85% of DC positive for GFP by flow cytometry. This was also visualised by confocal microscopy and electron microscopy of both gold- labelled VLP and conjugated antigen. RHDV VLP conjugate was shown to induce the significant up regulation of the activation markers CD40, CD80, CD86 and MHC class II on the surface of dendritic cells (DC). As well, DC pulsed with RHDV VLP/OVA effectively presented OVA to both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells transgenic for respective peptide-specific T cell receptors, eliciting a greater proliferative response in both T cell subsets than antigen delivered alone. 
 The surface accessibility of peptides on VLP was demonstrated, while administration of VLP/Ovalbumin (OVA) conjugate in mice was shown to evoke very high titre antibody responses specific for conjugated antigen. VLP/OVA conjugates were also shown to induce IFN-&#947; production and OVA-specific cytotoxic killing in vivo, of up to 80% of fluorescently labelled, adoptively transferred target cells. No distinguishable cytotoxicity was detected in unimmunised control mice. This assay was also used to demonstrate the necessity for antigen to be conjugated to VLP, as antigen mixed with VLP induced only sub-optimal killing. 
 To investigate the anti-tumour effects, mice vaccinated with VLP conjugated to OVA protein, CD4+ or CD8+ T cell OVA epitopes were inoculated with B16- OVA tumour cells and monitored for tumour growth. Untreated control mice had to be sacrificed by day 19, while mice immunised with either VLP/OVA or VLP conjugated with both CD4+ and CD8+ OVA epitopes, showed a significant delay in tumour growth (P = 0.0002), with one mouse remaining free of palpable tumour until day 92. 
 These results show that RHDV VLP can be easily produced and purified and demonstrate the versatility of this RHDV capsid. Rapid conjugation techniques allowed the modification of VLP with both peptide and protein rendered these antigens highly immunogenic, stimulating both humoral and cell-mediated immunity targeted against conjugated antigens of choice. The versatility and immune stimulating properties of RHDV VLP provides a molecular tool with almost limitless applications within the fields of nanotechnology and immunology.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">rabbit</field><field name="subject">rabbits</field><field name="subject">viral</field><field name="subject">vaccines</field><field name="subject">Rabbit calicivirus</field><field name="subject">disease</field><field name="subject">diseases</field><field name="subject">European rabbit</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080215.155033</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Molecular characterisation of chromatin introgressed from Hordeum bulbosum L. into Hordeum vulgare L</field><field name="creator">Johnston, Paul Andrew</field><field name="description">Hordeum bulbosum L. (bulbous barley grass) is an important genetic resource for barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) improvement. As the sole member of the secondary genepool of Hordeum; H. bulbosum represents a relatively untouched source of genetic diversity which can provide novel allelic variation for traits critical to the future of barley breeding. In order to access this resource efficiently, a complete set of molecular marker resources is necessary to assist the introgression of chromatin from H. bulbosum into a barley genetic background. 
 For breeders to access traits from H. bulbosum for barley improvement, recombinant lines need to be developed to transfer regions of the H. bulbosum genome into a barley background for trait identification and for incorporation into elite barley breeding programs. 
 The chromosomal location of H. bulbosum introgressions in thirty eight unique recombinant lines was performed using RFLP analysis using mostly distal probes from barley genetic linkage maps However, this analysis was labour intensive, restrictive and prone to inconsistencies due to low intensity signals and complex banding in H. bulbosum. 
 Due to the low level of interspecific recombination detected between the two species, a retrotransposon-like marker, pSc119.1, was developed which could be used to quickly screen progeny from an interspecific cross to determine which lines possessed introgressions of chromatin from H. bulbosum. 
 After initial screening, putative recombinants were further characterised using co-dominant single locus PCR markers from throughout the genome. A focus was made on using the EST resources of barley and wheat, combined with the rice genome to create intron-spanning markers. Subsequent allele-sequencing revealed high frequencies of species-diagnostic single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the intron regions of these markers, coupled with relatively low frequencies of species-diagnostic SNPs in the flanking exon regions. Overall, interspecific SNP frequencies were not significantly higher in intron-spanning markers than those consisting of exon-only sequence. However, species-diagnostic indels were more frequently discovered within intron sequence providing additional polymorphism. 
 Recombinant lines with phenotypes that differed from the barley parent allowed those traits to be assigned to particular chromosomal regions. These characterised recombinant lines will provide a resource for barley breeders to identify novel traits for barley improvement and allow identification of new alleles in different chromosomal locations for current traits, allowing greater flexibility for cultivar construction. 
 A targeted backcross population of the recombinant line 38P18/8/1/10 (possessing leaf rust resistance derived from H. bulbosum) was created. The introgressed region was saturated for PCR markers using a variety of marker types and techniques (AFLP, cDNA-AFLP). Two lines were subsequently identified with introgressions of reduced size relative to the parental recombinant line, both of which have retained the leaf rust resistance trait. The leaf rust resistance was finally linked to two co-dominant EST-based markers located on chromosome 2HL by using these two lines and the direct screening of progeny from interspecific hybrids possessing introgression junctions in the region of interest. 
 In general, recombinant material between barley and H. bulbosum suffers from certation effects which cause distorted segregation that favours heterozygous and homozygous barley genotypes. Two unique lines have been identified during this research that possess gametocidal-type loci that result in the absolute retention of H. bulbosum chromatin with the termination of gametes lacking the introgression (barley genotype only).</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Hordeum</field><field name="subject">barley</field><field name="subject">genetic aspects</field><field name="subject">molecular aspects</field><field name="subject">breeding</field><field name="subject">chromatin</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080215.161403</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Samuel Taylor Coleridge&#65533;s use of platonic and neoplatonic theories of evil and creation</field><field name="creator">McLean, Karen</field><field name="description">Samuel Taylor Coleridge used theories of evil and creation from Plato, Plotinus and Proclus to refine his definitions of the Trinity and the Absolute and Apostate Wills, and to move beyond the Germanic Naturphilosophie concept of self-hood as achieved by a self-objectification which emphasised differences between the persons of the Trinity rather than their similarities. His use of specific classical Greek concepts allowed him to propose that the Absolute Will&#65533;s self-substantiative act established unity and distinction as simultaneous and interrelated equals. From this, Coleridge investigated how identity and relationship rely upon unity and distinction, as he believed that identity is a unified self distinct from others, and that relationship is the unified common ground of many selves. 
 My first chapter explains my methodology in dealing with Coleridge&#65533;s problematic relationship with both Greek and German sources, and describes how Coleridge&#65533;s philosophical investigations into evil and creation resulted from personal crises oyer his sense of self and sin. I provide an overview of the system Coleridge devised to address these concerns, concentrating upon the aspects which he believed clarified humanity&#65533;s status in relation to evil and the divine. I demonstrate how Coleridge accounts for the origin of the Apostate Will, and I explain his view of identity and relationships between the persons of the Trinity, providing a relevant overview that allows me to point out his use of the fundamental Greek concepts that anchor the subsequent chapters on Plato, Plotinus and Proclus. 
 My second chapter examines Coleridge&#65533;s statement that Plato had formulated a triune creative principle, a concept critical to Coleridge&#65533;s need to unite God to the created universe. After describing the Platonic structure of reality and its divine creative act, I focus on the Platonic triad of Difference, Unity and Being. Plato&#65533;s account of these three principles and how they arise from the divine principle activity influences Coleridge&#65533;s view of the Trinity, what it contains in terms of distinction and unity, and how the Trinity arises from the superessential Absolute Will. I explain how Coleridge refined his definition of Christ as pleroma by referencing the way that the Form of the Good simultaneously exhibits plurality and identity. 
 My third chapter shows how the Plotinian theory of the One&#65533;s will-based self-substantiation influenced Coleridge&#65533;s definition of the Absolute Will. I determine that Plotinus&#65533;s concept of heterotes (otherness) informs Coleridge&#65533;s view of the origin of evil, and I show how his concept of redemption is influenced by Plotinus&#65533;s account of noetic contemplation. 
 My fourth chapter explains how Coleridge used the Proclian concept of Bound to develop the actualising quality of the Logos, in relation to Christ as a successful plurality but also in terms of Christ&#65533;s role in the redemption. 
 My conclusion surveys all four philosophers to demonstrate how concepts drawn from Plato, Plotinus and Proclus helped Coleridge to define the Absolute Will and the way that its activity is the unity, distinction, identity and relationship of the Trinity. These three distinct yet related systems influenced Coleridge&#65533;s view of evil, as well as his understanding of the Absolute Will&#65533;s self-creative act, its relation to the Trinity, and the simultaneously fallen and divine status of humanity.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Samuel Taylor Coleridge (1772-1834)</field><field name="subject">philosophy</field><field name="subject">criticism</field><field name="subject">interpretation</field><field name="subject">Plato</field><field name="subject">influence</field><field name="subject">ancient philosophy</field><field name="subject">neoplatonism</field><field name="subject">good</field><field name="subject">evil</field><field name="subject">creation</field><field name="subject">literature</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080222.121810</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The early life of James Hector, 1834 to 1865 : the first Otago Provincial Geologist</field><field name="creator">Hocken, A. G</field><field name="description">The geologist James Hector (1834-1907) was, by any measure, the most important and influential scientist in nineteenth century New Zealand. In the mid 1860s, he became the first Director of the New Zealand Geological Survey and the Colonial Museum. Thereafter he ran the Colonial Laboratory, set up the Meteorological Service and the Wellington Botanical Gardens and was responsible for the establishment of the New Zealand Institute, acting as its manager and editor of its Transactions and Proceedings for more than 30 years. This work explores the formative years of his career from his early years in Scotland, his experiences with the Palliser Expedition in Canada, and pivotally, his first four years in New Zealand as the first Otago Provincial Geologist. 
 By the time of James Hector&#65533;s entry as a medical student to Edinburgh University in 1852, he had already developed a strong interest in natural history, particularly geology. Although he graduated M.D. from Edinburgh in 1856, that course of study served only as a means of access to the natural sciences. Hector&#65533;s interest and training in geology developed at an opportune time, when there was increasing demand for geologists to explore the expanding industrial British Empire for coal and other mineral raw materials. 
 Hector&#65533;s reputation in geology in Edinburgh brought him to the attention of that most influential British geologist, Sir Roderick Murchison, whose recommendation led to his appointment to the British North American Expedition of 1857 (the Palliser Expedition). Hector was acknowledged, on several counts, as a major contributor to the success of the expedition. When the Otago Provincial Government in New Zealand requested advice on the appointment of a geologist for the province, Murchison predictably proposed Hector. 
 Having reviewed and assessed his work in North America, this thesis deals with the arrival of Hector as Otago Provincial Geologist in Dunedin during the prosperity of the gold rush of the early 1860s. For the first nine months he explored the central and eastern areas of the Province (Chapter 2) and the following year led the exploration of the West Coast, where there was potential for coal, gold and timber-and reputedly copper-and the prospect of providing a commercial route to Melbourne. The two month long expedition up the Matukituki Valley preceded the exploration by ship of the West Coast of the South Island as far north as Martins Bay. The latter became a major triumph on the strength of the contemporary perception of a route between Queenstown and Martins Bay potentially opening up a direct contact between Dunedin and Melbourne. 
 From mid-1864, Hector&#65533;s life was governed by the organisation of the International Exhibition, which opened in Dunedin in January 1865. In that context, he travelled to seek support and participation from the other provinces of New Zealand, a political and administrative commission which he combined with geological exploration. 
 After the closure of the successful Exhibition in May 1865 and subsequent to the conclusion of his appointment on 1st April 1865, Hector left Otago in August to take up the newly created post of Director of the New Zealand Geological Survey in Wellington. The parting was not administratively smooth and relations between Hector and the Otago Provincial Government were strained by the lack of a final, definitive, report on the Geology of Otago. An overview of Hector&#65533;s geology, specifically his interest in coal and gold, and the evolution of his views on the vexed question of the role of glaciers as geomorphologic agents is provided. 
 James Hector was a man of versatile ability and strong leadership.

 Methods: An in vitro testing apparatus was designed and made and the release of model actives [bromophenol blue (BPB) and horseradish peroxidase (HRP)] from gels and films of hydroxylpropylmethylcellulose (HPMC) (E4M CR, K4M CR and E10M CR) was determined. In this study, Fibroblast Growth Factor -2 (FGF-2) (0.3 [mu]g) was incorporated into three formulations (solution, gel and dried gel film on Melolin[TM] backing) and together with a control formulation were administered to punch biopsy wounds in rats. The in vivo release was followed over three time periods (two, five and eight hours) and the amount of FGF-2 at various wound depths was quantified by ELISA. Two biological markers IL-1&#946; and MCP-1 were quantified using ELISA. The FGF-2 was additionally tagged with a fluorescent dye so that visualisation of the penetration could be obtained via confocal microsopy. 
 Results: For the HPMC gels, the more viscous gel (E10M) provided a greater diffusional barrier and slowed the release of BPB (12 &#65533; 3.5 [mu]g/min compared with 16 &#65533; 1.7 [mu]g/min and 18 &#65533; 1.4 [mu]g/min for K4M and E4M respectively). However, when HPMC was formulated as a dried film a burst release was seen and release of BPB was slowest from the more rapidly hydrating K4M. With the larger model active HRP, there was a slower diffusion through the gel barrier formed upon film hydration, such that time of 100% release was up to 300 minutes compared to approximately 60 minutes for BPB. When the film was dried onto a supportive backing, the initial burst release was minimised as the film did not break apart on contact with the wound, and hence film integrity was maintained and release prolonged. The in vivo studies showed that, two hours after application, the highest concentration of FGF-2 was seen in the surface granulation tissue of rats that received the solution formulation (2280 &#65533; 790 pg/g). The concentration decreased with increasing tissue depth but was significantly greater than the saline control in the surface granulation and subcutaneous fat layers (p&lt;0.05). Tissue concentrations following application of the gel and film formulations were only marginally greater than control in the surface granulation layer. After eight hours, rats that received the solution retained elevated surface tissue concentrations (surface granulation and subcutaneous fat) of FGF-2. Repeated measures ANOVA using a general linear model showed statistically significant differences in the mean FGF-2 level with respect to formulation and length of time of application of the formulation (p&lt;0.05). In terms of other cytokines, there was a release of both IL-1&#946; and MCP-1 in all groups, immediately post-wounding, probably in response to cellular damage. After eight hours, the film formulation appeared to elevate IL-1&#946; levels which may be useful to drive wound healing. Confocal microscopy images showed diffuse distribution of FGF-2 eight hours after application of the solution formulation after eight hours and that with the gel formulation FGF-2 initially aggregated at the wound surface. 
 Conclusion: In vitro experiments investigating the effect of hydration rate and viscosity of HPLC polymers allowed a formulation to be chosen for further in vivo study. Elevated FGF-2 could be measured in superficial wound tissues up to eight hours after application of a solution. However, application of a comparable amount of FGF-2 in HPMC gels or films did not produce appreciable elevations in FGF-2 in wound tissues, although confocal microscopy indicated the penetration of FGF-2 into the wound for up to eight hours.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">wound</field><field name="subject">healing</field><field name="subject">injuries</field><field name="subject">treatment</field><field name="subject">growth</field><field name="subject">factors</field><field name="subject">drug delivery systems</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080228.135050</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Rheology of the Alpine Fault Mylonite Zone : deformation processes at and below the base of the seismogenic zone in a major plate boundary structure</field><field name="creator">Toy, Virginia Gail</field><field name="description">The Alpine Fault is the major structure of the Pacific-Australian plate boundary through New Zealand&#65533;s South Island. During dextral reverse fault slip, a &lt;5 million year old, ~1 km thick mylonite zone has been exhumed in the hanging-wall, providing unique exposure of material deformed to very high strains at deep crustal levels under boundary conditions constrained by present-day plate motions. The purpose of this study was to investigate the fault zone rheology and mechanisms of strain localisation, to obtain further information about how the structural development of this shear zone relates to the kinematic and thermal boundary constraints, and to investigate the mechanisms by which the viscously deforming mylonite zone is linked to the brittle structure, that fails episodically causing large earthquakes. 
 This study has focussed on the central section of the fault from Harihari to Fox Glacier. In this area, mylonites derived from a quartzofeldspathic Alpine Schist protolith are most common, but slivers of Western Province-derived footwall material, which can be differentiated using mineralogy and bulk rock geochemistry, were also incorporated into the fault zone. These footwall-derived mylonites are increasingly common towards the north. 
 At amphibolite-facies conditions mylonitic deformation was localised to the mylonite and ultramylonite subzones of the schist-derived mylonites. Most deformation was accommodated by dislocation creep of quartz, which developed strong Y-maximum crystallographic preferred orientation (CPO) patterns by prism (a) dominant slip. Formation of this highly-oriented fabric would have led to significant geometric softening and enhanced strain localisation. During this high strain deformation, pre-existing Alpine Schist fabrics in polyphase rocks were reconstituted to relatively well-mixed, finer-grained aggregates. As a result of this fabric homogenisation, strong syn-mylonitic object lineations were not formed. Strain models show that weak lineations trending towards ~090&#65533; and kinematic directions indicated by asymmetric fabrics and CPO pattern symmetry could have formed during pure shear stretches up-dip of the fault of ~3.5, coupled with simple shear strains [greater than or equal to]30. The preferred estimate of simple:pure shear strain gives a kinematc vorticity number, W[k] [greater than or equal to]&#818; 0.9997. 
 Rapid exhumation due to fault slip resulted in advection of crustal isotherms. New thermobarometric and fluid inclusion analyses from fault zone materials allow the thermal gradient along an uplift path in the fault rocks to be more precisely defined than previously. Fluid inclusion data indicate temperatures of 325+&#818;15&#65533;C were experienced at depths of ~45 km, so that a high thermal gradient of ~75&#65533;C km&#8315;&#65533; is indicated in the near-surface. This gradient must fall off to [ less than approximately]l0&#65533;C km&#8315;&#65533; below the brittle-viscous transition since feldspar thermobarometry, Ti-inbiotite thermometry and the absence of prism(c)-slip quartz CPO fabrics indicate deformation temperatures did not exceed ~ 650&#65533;C at [greater than or equal to] 7.0-8.5&#65533;1.5 kbar, ie. 26-33 km depth. 
 During exhumation, the strongly oriented quartzite fabrics were not favourably oriented for activation of the lower temperature basal(a) slip system, which should have dominated at depths [less than approximately]20 km. Quartz continued to deform by crystal-plastic mechanisms to shallow levels. However, pure dislocation creep of quartz was replaced by a frictional-viscous deformation mechanism of sliding on weak mica basal planes coupled with dislocation creep of quartz. Such frictional-viscous flow is particularly favoured during high-strain rate events as might be expected during rupture of the overlying brittle fault zone. Maximum flow stresses supported by this mechanism are ~65 Mpa, similar to those indicated by recrystallised grain size paleopiezometry of quartz (D&gt;25[mu]m, indicating [Delta][sigma][max] ~55 MPa for most mylonites). It is likely that the preferentially oriented prism (a) slip system was activated during these events, so the Y-maximum CPO fabrics were preserved. Simple numerical models show that activation of this slip system is favoured over the basal (a) system, which has a lower critical resolved shear stress (CRSS) at low temperatures, for aggregates with strong Y-maximum orientations. Absence of pervasive crystal-plastic deformation of micas and feldspars during activation of this mechanism also resulted in preservation of mineral chemistries from the highest grades of mylonitic deformation (ie. amphibolite-facies). 
 Retrograde, epidote-amphibolite to greenschist-facies mineral assemblages were pervasively developed in ultramylonites and cataclasites immediately adjacent to the fault core and in footwall-derived mylonites, perhaps during episodic transfer of this material into and subsequently out of the cooler footwall block. In the more distal protomylonites, retrograde assemblages were locally developed along shear bands that also accommodated most of the mylonitic deformation in these rocks. Ti-in-biotite thermometry suggests biotite in these shear bands equilibrated down to ~500+&#818;50&#65533;C, suggesting crystal-plastic deformation of this mineral continued to these temperatures. Crossed-girdle quartz CPO fabrics were formed in these protomylonites by basal (a) dominant slip, indicating a strongly oriented fabric had not previously formed at depth due to the relatively small strains, and that dislocation creep of quartz continued at depths [less than or equal to]20 km. Lineation orientations, CPO fabric symmetry and shear-band fabrics in these protomylonites are consistent with a smaller simple:pure shear strain ratio than that observed closer to the fault core (W[k] [greater than approximately] 0.98), but require a similar total pure shear component. Furthermore, they indicate an increase in the simple shear component with time, consistent with incorporation of new hanging-wall material into the fault zone. Pre-existing lineations were only slowly rotated into coincidence with the mylonitic simple shear direction in the shear bands since they lay close to the simple shear plane, and inherited orientations were not destroyed until large finite strains (&lt;100) were achieved. 
 As the fault rocks were exhumed through the brittle-viscous transition, they experienced localised brittle shear failures. These small-scale seismic events formed friction melts (ie. pseudotachylytes). The volume of pseudotachylyte produced is related to host rock mineralogy (more melt in host rocks containing hydrated minerals), and fabric (more melt in isotropic host rocks). Frictional melting also occurred within cataclastic hosts, indicating the cataclasites around the principal slip surface of the Alpine Fault were produced by multiple episodes of discrete shear rather than distributed cataclastic flow. Pseudotachylytes were also formed in the presence of fluids, suggesting relatively high fault gouge permeabilities were transiently attained, probably during large earthquakes. Frictional melting contributed to formation of phyllosilicate-rich fault gouges, weakening the brittle structure and promoting slip localisation. The location of faulting and pseudotachylyte formation, and the strength of the fault in the brittle regime were strongly influenced by cyclic hydrothermal cementation processes. 
 A thermomechanical model of the central Alpine Fault zone has been defined using the results of this study. The mylonites represent a localised zone of high simple shear strain, embedded in a crustal block that underwent bulk pure shear. The boundaries of the simple shear zone moved into the surrounding material with time. This means that the exhumed sequence does not represent a simple 'time slice' illustrating progressive fault rock development during increasing simple shear strains. The deformation history of the mylonites at deep crustal P-T conditions had a profound influence on subsequent deformation mechanisms and fabric development during exhumation.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">South Island</field><field name="subject">Alpine Fault</field><field name="subject">geology</field><field name="subject">faults (geology)</field><field name="subject">mylonite</field><field name="subject">plate tectonics</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080305.110949</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Understanding and improving the cryopreservation of pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas) oocytes via the use of two approaches : modification of an existing cryopreservation protocol and manipulation of the lipis fraction of the oocytes</field><field name="creator">Salinas-Flores, Liliana</field><field name="description">Cryopreservation of gametes is a valuable tool for the fast-growing aquaculture industry in New Zealand. In the present study, research was aimed to improve the cryopreservation of Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas) oocytes. For this, two main approaches were used: the modification of an existing published (standard) cryopreservation protocol for oyster oocytes and the modification of the oocytes themselves prior to cryopreservation. The objectives in the chapters of this thesis were: (a) determination of the cryobiological characteristics of oyster oocytes; (b) assessment and reduction of intracellular ice formation (IIF) in oocytes; and (c) modification of the lipid fraction (cholesterol and fatty acids) of oocytes prior to cryopreservation. 
 Knowledge of the membrane permeability parameters in response to concentrations of water and ethylene glycol (EG), the influence of temperature upon these parameters, and the osmotic tolerance limits of oyster oocytes were used to develop computer models that simulated the cellular volume changes that oocytes underwent during EG addition and removal. The models predicted that when one part of EG was added in one step to one part of oocyte suspension and equilibrated for 20 min at 20 &#65533;C, similar volume changes in oocytes would be obtained, compared to a more complicated multi-step addition method. This method of addition resulted in similar post-thaw fertilization rates to those obtained by using the multi-step addition method, thus reducing oocyte handling. 
 Cryomicroscopy was used to assess the effect of cooling rates and EG concentration on the temperature at which oocytes underwent IIF. It was found that IIF occurred at higher subzero temperatures when fast cooling rates were used (30 and 5 &#65533;C min&#8315;&#65533;) and at EG concentrations ranged between 0 and 15%. At a relatively slower cooling rate of 0.3 &#65533;C min&#8315;&#65533; and with 10% EG, which are the conditions employed in the standard cryopreservation protocol, no IIF occurred. 
 The steps of the standard protocol that were more likely to cause oocyte damage were identified by evaluating the fertilization rate of oocytes at each step. Results showed that oocytes were most damaged by cooling them to -35 &#65533;C and followed by plunging them in liquid nitrogen. Contrary to what had been observed under the cryomicroscope, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis revealed that all oocytes cryopreserved by the standard protocol contained cytoplasmic ice. In addition, it was also observed that oocytes were at two developmental stages when frozen (prophase and metaphase I). These observations prompted the development of alternative cooling programmes aimed to reduce intracellular ice. The effect of cooling rate, plunge temperature and time held at the plunge temperature were thus evaluated, based on post-thaw fertilization rate of oocytes. Overall, neither the cooling rate nor the holding time had an effect on oocyte fertility. However, the plunge temperature had an effect, where oocytes plunged at -60 &#65533;C had lower post-thaw fertilization rates than oocytes plunged at -35 &#65533;C. Through the slowing of the cooling rate, lengthening of the holding time and lowering of the plunge temperature, it was possible to reduce the amount of ice in the cytoplasm. However, the reduction of intracellular ice did not improve the post-thaw fertilization rate of the oocytes; on the contrary, post-thaw fertilization decreased notoriously. From these results, it can be suggested that oyster oocytes are more likely to be damaged by exposure to high intra and extracellular solute concentration than IIF during cryopreservation. 
 In an effort to modify the lipid content of oyster oocytes prior to cryopreservation and thus, making them more resistant during cryopreservation, oocytes were incubated in solutions that would add or remove cholesterol or in solutions rich in long chain fatty acids (EPA or DHA). Oocytes incubated in cholesterol-rich solutions showed a positive uptake of fluorescently labelled cholesterol and this effect was dose dependent. Nevertheless, this uptake did not improve the post-thaw fertilization rate nor did it increase the total cholesterol content of the oocytes. When oocytes were incubated in non-conjugated or conjugated EPA or DHA, no increase in the proportion of these fatty acids was identified in the fatty acid profiles of whole oocytes and no improvement of the post-thaw fertilization rate was recorded. 
 Given that there was no uptake of fatty acids from the incubation media by the oocytes, a different approach was taken. This involved the supplementation of lipid-rich diets to the oyster broodstock during gametogenesis (cold-conditioning) and vitellogenesis (warm-conditioning). Despite results showing that lipid content and, indeed, fatty acid profile was altered through the diet, the results also showed that fresh oocytes from broodstock fed during cold-conditioning did not show any improvement in their fertilization rates, nor did they benefit from a lipid-rich diet during warm-conditioning. On the other hand, cryopreserved oocytes did have higher post-thaw fertilisation rates when broodstock were fed during cold-conditioning and, although no effect was found from feeding broodstock with either of the lipid-rich diets during warm-conditioning, trends indicated that a diet consisting of fresh microalgae or the commercial supplement Algamac would yield the highest post-thaw fertilization rates. 
 This thesis has furthered the understanding of some of the factors that determine cryosurvival in oyster oocytes and has demonstrated that both physical and biological issues must be taken into consideration for cryopreservation. Specifically, the results in this thesis helped to modify an empirically developed cryopreservation protocol for Pacific oyster oocytes. In addition, the results also showed strong evidence of the survival of oyster oocytes to intracellular ice and highlighted the importance of supplying the broodstock with lipid-rich food during the periods of gamete formation and maturation in order to obtain oocytes that are more amenable to cryopreservation. These benefits could be of significant practical importance and may be extended for the development or refinement of cryopreservation protocols for other shellfish species of commercial importance to the aquaculture industry of New Zealand.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cryopreservation</field><field name="subject">organs</field><field name="subject">tissues</field><field name="subject">ovum</field><field name="subject">cells</field><field name="subject">Pacific oyster</field><field name="subject">germplasm resources</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080305.143446</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Creation of an instrument to assess intercultural communication competence for strategic international human resource management</field><field name="creator">Kupka, Bernd</field><field name="description">The first research objective of this dissertation is to extend existing conceptualizations of intercultural communication competence to create a new theoretically grounded construct, the Rainbow Model of Intercultural Communication Competence. The second research objective of this dissertation is to utilize this foundation and assemble a new instrument, the 127-item Intercultural Communication Competence Inventory (ICCI). The ICCI consists of sub-scales to measure foreign language competence, non-verbal communication competence, perceptions of cultural distance, intercultural self-awareness, intercultural communication knowledge, intercultural communication skills, intercultural communication motivation, intercultural communication appropriateness, intercultural communication effectiveness, intercultural contextual relationships, and intercultural affinity. This tool is designed assist strategic international human resource management practitioners to find, select, and/or train the best possible candidates for international assignments in an efficient manner. 
 To accomplish these goals, a quantitative research design has been adopted. In a pilot study and three subsequent studies data was collected between 2005 and 2006 when the ICCI was administered to students in 19 courses with clear intercultural education elements at eleven universities in four countries (New Zealand, Germany, United Arab Emirates, USA) to build four samples of students: self tests (N = 1014) and retests (N = 587), peer tests (N = 613) and retests (N = 529). The ICCI was used as a paper-pencil and an online questionnaire. Using this method is appropriate as it provides intercultural communication trainers with quantifiable results to differentiate candidates and to measure training effectiveness. 
 This dissertation has produced several research findings. Each of the ICCI sub-scales is psychometrically scrutinized and results described in detail. In exploratory factor analyses most scales have supported their theoretical framework as described in the Rainbow Model of ICC. Most sub-scales show independence from a variety of biases, and demonstrate sensitivity to competence changes over time and differences between evaluators. Various hypothesized links between the scales could be verified. The entire ICCI demonstrated that, despite currently still insufficient sample sizes, its conceptual roots, the Rainbow Model of Intercultural Communication Competence, is recognizable in self and peer tests and retests. 
 The implications of the findings of this dissertation are threefold: First, the Rainbow Model of Intercultural Communication Competence has received preliminary confirmation. Second, the ICCI has initially shown a tendency to be a practical and reliable tool for recruiting, selecting of, and conducting training needs assessments that facilitate intercultural communication training effectiveness evaluations for suitable candidates for international assignments. Third, ICCI sub-scales have demonstrated the potential to enhance selection and training efforts in a speedy and specific way to support resource-cognizant intercultural training. The reader, however, is cautioned that a variety of limitations of this study need to be acknowledged. Finally, numerous areas of future research are identified.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">personnel</field><field name="subject">management</field><field name="subject">cross-cultural studies</field><field name="subject">international</field><field name="subject">enterprises</field><field name="subject">intercultural</field><field name="subject">communication</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080312.134104</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of perceived occupational stress, burnout and sense of community among New Zealand nurses</field><field name="creator">Ditzel, Elizabeth Mary</field><field name="description">This research shows that sense of community reduces the effect of job stress on burnout among a sample of 672 New Zealand nurses. Sense of community - a feeling that members matter to one another (and to the group) and a shared faith that members&#65533; needs will be met through their commitment to be together - consists of four elements: membership, integration and fulfilment of needs, influence and shared emotional connection. Results indicate that nurses have a moderate to high level of sense of community. Apart from the influence element, subscale reliabilities for the other three elements were acceptably high on the Nurse Sense of Community Index, an instrument that was developed for use in this study. 
 In relation to occupational stress, the study results indicate that high workload, rather than any difference in the practice requirements of various types of nursing work is the most important factor contributing to nurses&#65533; job stress. Public hospital nurses experience significantly higher levels of perceived job stress than their private sector counterparts because high workloads and problems of recruiting and retaining nurses are more typical of the public sector. Nurses who work full-time experience more job stress than those who work part-time, and those in the 20 to 30 age group experience the highest frequency of perceived job stress. 
 Burnout is a syndrome of high emotional exhaustion and high depersonalisation in the presence of a lack of personal accomplishment. Nurses who work full-time experience significantly higher levels of emotional exhaustion and depersonalisation than those who work part-time. Accident and emergency nurses have the highest level of burnout and intensive care unit nurses the lowest level of burnout among public hospital nurses. 
 Overall, the majority of nurses experience a low to moderate degree of burnout. Yet, a substantial proposition of the sample population acknowledge experiencing some aspect of burnout, and as has been found by other nursing studies, a nurse&#65533;s age influences burnout levels, with younger nurses experiencing more burnout than older nurses. A clear relationship between an increased frequency of perceived job stress and burnout was identified. Results suggest that nurses with a high level of sense of community have lower frequencies of perceived job stress, experience lower burnout than those with low and moderate levels of sense of community. Findings demonstrate that burnout remains a serious issue for nurses the nursing profession and, as the demands on professional workers increase, the health care sector. 
 The theoretical and practical implications of the study&#65533;s findings for management practice are postulated in the conclusion of this thesis.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">nurses</field><field name="subject">job stress</field><field name="subject">burn out (psychology)</field><field name="subject">stress (psychology)</field><field name="subject">communities</field><field name="subject">job satisfaction.</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080313.094654</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A role for filamin-C in the function of the type 2A serotonin receptor</field><field name="creator">Cawston, Erin</field><field name="description">The serotonin receptor 2A (5-HT&#8322;[A]) is a member of the G-protein coupled receptor family and is of interest due to its role in physiological functions such as smooth muscle contraction, platelet aggregation, thermoregulation, learning and memory. More importantly, 5-HT&#8322;[A] has also been implicated in CNS disorders including schizophrenia, depression and anxiety. 
 A yeast two-hybrid screen had previously been carried out to identify proteins that interacted with 5-HT&#8322;[A] and therefore may modulate intracellular function. The cytoskeletal actin-binding protein filamin-C was identified as a possible 5-HT&#8322;[A] interacting partner. The aim of the research in this thesis was to further investigate the potential interaction between 5-HT&#8322;[A] and filamin-C and to investigate functional roles for the interaction. 
 A fragment of human filamin-C, aa 2162-2725, was shown to interact with the C-terminus of human 5-HT&#8322;[A] using two in vitro techniques, the yeast-two hybrid system and a GST capture assay. The region of filamin-C needed to bind to 5-HT&#8322;[A] was narrowed to the start of repeat 20, aa 2251, through to aa 2424 at the beginning of repeat 22 and comprises 182 residues. The 5-HT&#8322;[A] region needed to bind to filamin-C was ascertained via yeast two-hybrid to be 31 amino acids between 394-423. 
 Work was performed to determine whether FLNC mRNA was expressed in neural and glial cells and whether FLNC and HTR2A mRNA were co-expressed in any cells. FLNC mRNA was identified in seven out of eight neural and glial cell lines and western blot analysis confirmed this finding at the protein level. Two cell lines, U-118MG and A172, were found to contain both HTR2A and FLNC mRNA. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments showed endogenous filamin-C bound to endogenous 5-HT&#8322;[A] and this complex could be precipitated using anti-filamin-C antibody. Additionally, a GST-5-HT&#8322;[A] fusion complex was found to bind to endogenous filamin-C from U-118MG cells. 
 Immunofluorescent labelling of cells was used to study filamin-C and 5-HT&#8322;[A] proteins in vivo. U-118MG cells showed staining for 5-HT&#8322;[A] around the membrane of the cell, as well as in the cytoplasm, whereas filamin-C staining occurred in the cytoplasm. Co-localisation analysis identified some areas of overlap between 5-HT&#8322;[A] and filamin-C in the cytoplasm of U-118MG cells. 
 The functional role for the 5-HT&#8322;[A]/filamin-C colocalisation was investigated. It was postulated that filamin-C may be involved in the internalisation of 5-HT&#8322;[A]. To test this hypothesis, an in vivo model system was used to investigate whether disruption of the filamin-C/5-HT&#8322;[A] interaction affects internalisation of the receptor. The key preliminary findings of this study, which used expression of a competitor peptide, to disrupt and co-interact, suggested that the filamin-C/5-HT&#8322;[A] interaction is not essential for the internalisation of receptors in response to ligand binding. However, this interaction was important for delivery or maintenance of 5-HT&#8322;[A] to the cell membrane, and expression of the competing peptide caused an accumulation of cytoplasmic 5-HT&#8322;[A].</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">serotonin</field><field name="subject">receptors</field><field name="subject">microfilament proteins</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080313.141311</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Developing compound-specific stable isotope tools for monitoring landfill leachate</field><field name="creator">Benbow, Timothy J</field><field name="description">This thesis has developed a suite of compound specific stable isotope tools to monitor landfill leachate and identify the infiltration of leachate to ground water and surface water. These tools have the power to indicate the fractional contribution multiple discrete sources of pollution are making to a single location. This journey began by developing two solid phase extraction (SPE) methods to extract non-polar and polar organic compounds from leachate with minimal fractionation of hydrogen or carbon isotopes. Non-polar compounds were successfully extracted using ENV+ SPE cartridges and polar compounds were successfully extracted using Strata-X SPE cartridges. The isotopic fractionation of non-polar compounds during ENV+ extraction varied significantly (up to 245&#8304;/&#8320;&#8320; and 1.8&#8304;/&#8320;&#8320; for D and &#65533;&#65533;C respectively, when eluted with acetonitrile and ethyl acetate, as recommended by manufacturers) but the fractionation of compounds eluted with dichloromethane was negligible (less than instrumental precision). Polar compounds were eluted from Strata-X cartridges with negligible isotopic fractionation using methanol. The direct comparison of SPE and liquid-liquid extraction found SPE to extract slightly more compound from leachate then liquid-liquid extraction (especially for polar compounds) and the isotopic compositions of compounds did not change with extraction methods. 
 These new analytical methods subsequently were used to determine the isotopic compositions of organic compounds dissolved in leachates from three New Zealand landfills. The molecular and isotopic signature of leachate varied significantly between landfills, indicating the isotopic fingerprint of organic compounds in leachate is unsuitable as a universal tracer of leachate. However, compounds such as terpien-4-ol, methylethylbenzene and juvabione maintained their isotopic composition over short geographical distance-indicating their potential as site-specific tracers of leachate. Organic compounds analysed on a transect across the landfill boundary indicated polar compounds were more mobile than semi-volatile compounds and possessed a more conservative isotopic composition. However, hexadecanoic acid extracted from leachate and ground water was highly depleted in &#65533;&#65533;C (-72 &#8304;/&#8320;&#8320; to -40&#8304;/&#8320;&#8320;), indicative of methanogenic and sulfate reducing bacteria. These bacteria only live in highly reducing environments such as leachate; therefore their presence in the pristine environment can potentially indicate the release of leachate from the landfill. 
 The final experiments traced the uptake and utilisation of leachate by periphyton. The isotopic composition of bulk periphyton, fatty acids and phytol indicated that microbial assimilation and utilisation of nutrients is a complex process. Fatty acid biomarkers for green algae and diatoms showed signs of leachate derived nutrients, however the availability of nutrients (carbon, nitrogen, water and light) caused significant changes in metabolic processes and isotopic compositions. Under slow growing conditions, the [delta]&#65533;&#65533;C composition of periphyton became enriched in &#65533;&#65533;C as solar irradiation levels decreased (including shading by detritus and periphyton), while the [delta]D composition of fatty acid was controlled by the internal recycling of hydrogen. This study indicated the power of compound specific isotope analysis as a tool to detect the release of landfill leachate from a landfill, especially at locations with multiple potential sources of contaminants, and provides a sound platform for future research.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">stable isotope tracers</field><field name="subject">groundwater</field><field name="subject">pollution</field><field name="subject">sanitary landfills</field><field name="subject">soils</field><field name="subject">leaching</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080314.111826</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Hauhaketia to wahia i mua i te takurua : Maori and genetic health research : a case study</field><field name="creator">Wyeth, Emma Hana</field><field name="description">This project was carried out under a broad theme of Maori health and investigates the genetics of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and gout within two Maori case-control cohorts. In addition, it reports on the developmental stages of a whanau project focussing on the compilation of our whakapapa and collation of information relating to type 2 diabetes within the Parata whanau, which I whakapapa to. My conducting this research in light of me being Maori is also considered: much of the prevailing literature on Maori and science describes science as the handmaid of colonisation, and singles out genetic research as being "neo-colonial". I reject those that would label me a "sell-out" and show how my research is shaped by, and consistent with, the history of my immediate tipuna, and my iwi more generally, since European contact. 
 RA is an autoimmune disease of the joints and affects approximately 1% of the general population. There is currently very little data available on its prevalence in New Zealand although it is thought that it is similar to those of the rest of the world. Gout is the most common form of inflammatory arthritis in Caucasian males and recent data suggests a worldwide increase in prevalence in many populations. Gout is characterised by the deposition of monosodium urate or uric acid crystals in the joints, which produces an inflammatory response. In New Zealand, the prevalence of gout is estimated to be 3% in Caucasians and twice this in Maori. Both RA and gout are complex arthritic diseases and are influenced by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. It is likely that numerous genetic susceptibility loci are responsible for the genetic components of these diseases. 
 This project tests various genetic regions for susceptibility to or protection against both RA and gout in two separate Maori case cohorts and a common control cohort. To do this, the confounding factor of population stratification, resulting from population admixture, was overcome via developing a method specific for these Maori cohorts. This tool utilised genotype data from a set of unlinked genome-wide markers and the structure and STRAT software packages, allowing valid case-control studies to be carried out in the presence of population stratification. These data showed that four sub-populations exist in the Maori RA case-control cohort and three in the Maori gout case-control cohort. 
 A number of studies have confirmed the HLA region as the major genetic determinant of autoimmunity and recently, PTPN22 and CTLA-4 variants have been shown to be common to the onset of a number of autoimmune phenotypes. The IDDM6 region on chromosome 18 has also been implicated in type 1 diabetes, RA and autoimmune thyroiditis and contains a number of candidate genes for a role in RA, many of which were investigated in this thesis. Polymorphisms within the PTPN22, CTLA-4, BCL2, SMAD4, DCC, TNFRSF11A, PADI4, CCR5 and CCL3L1 genes were tested for association with RA in the Maori cohort (98 cases and 109 controls) with some significant association results obtained. The HLA-DRB1*02 and HLA-DRB1*08 loci were associated with the protection against and susceptibility for RA, respectively (P = 0.004 and 0.017). The deviation of CCL3L1 copy-number from the cohort mean (two copies) was also associated with the RA development. Copy-number &lt;2 indicated association with protection against RA (P = 0.012) and copy-number &gt;2 indicated association with susceptibility to RA (P = 0.002). However, it must be stressed that these results were obtained without accounting for the presence of population stratification. 
 The organic anion transporter (OAT) and the urate transporter 1 (URAT1) genes, involved in the regulation of blood urate levels, are members of the solute carrier transporter (SLC) family and provide good candidates for a role in gout. A number of polymorphisms within the OAT, URAT1 and the SLC5A8 genes were tested for association with gout in the Maori cohort (72 cases and 109 controls) with some success. The SLC5A8 rs1709189 SNP was significantly associated with gout in this cohort (P = 0.004). Polymorphisms within two alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) genes were also tested for association due to their role in alcohol metabolism and the association between alcohol consumption and gout. The ADH2 rs1229984 SNP was also significantly associated with gout in this cohort (P = 0.012). These significant results were obtained after population stratification was taken into account. 
 The data presented in this thesis confirm the presence of population stratification in the two Maori case-control cohorts and demonstrate some association of the HLA-DRB1 region and CCL3L1 with RA and the SLC5A8 and ADH2 genes with gout. An extensive whakapapa of our whanau has also been compiled and associated type 2 diabetes information collected. However, this is by no means a completed task and work will continue on this project under the guidance of the Parata whanau.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">people</field><field name="subject">genealogy</field><field name="subject">health</field><field name="subject">hygiene</field><field name="subject">genetics</field><field name="subject">rheumatism</field><field name="subject">genetic aspects</field><field name="subject">gout</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080319.114119</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Contesting natures : a discourse analysis of natural resource conflicts</field><field name="creator">Walton, Sara</field><field name="description">This research explores the discursive formations involved in two environmental conflicts during which organisations were not permitted to carry out their proposed extractive activities. The conflicts were based on the West Coast of the South Island in New Zealand. The first involved sustainable native logging and the second was over the siting and extension of a gold mine. 
 Extensive archival and media searches were carried out to generate data on the conflicts. Interviews were also conducted to investigate the community position in more depth. The discourse theory of Laclau and Mouffe (2001 [1985]) is drawn upon as a framework to make sense of the conflicts. This framework was particularly useful as it enabled a close and careful examination of the antagonisms and addressed some of the ideological and power concerns with stakeholder analysis. The analysis involved identifying nodal points, subjectivity, subject positions and floating signifiers, which enabled certain hegemonic constructions. 
 The two conflicts were considerably different. The hegemonic constructions were quite similar and the notion of &#65533;being green&#65533; emerged as an antagonism that was at the heart of the conflicts and a key to understanding why these business organisations were unsuccessful. That is, who or what is given meaning as &#65533;being green&#65533; negates and de-legitimates other activity that is not deemed to be green. In these conflicts business organisations extracting natural resources and subjects supporting these organisational activities could not be green - when being green was constituted in terms of the clean green discourse operating economically and socially within New Zealand (see Bell, 1996). Consequently, not being green was deemed to be outside of what we see as New Zealanders as being important and thus should not occur in this country. 
 This research has implications for business organisations in New Zealand dealing with greening issues, especially as external stakeholders can have considerable influence on organisational activities. Theoretically it argues for a discursive approach to organisational stakeholder analysis in order to address power and subjectivity and for the organisation and natural environment literature to recognise the possibility of multiple meanings of nature. In particular, this thesis contributes to current organisation studies literature by explicitly focusing on &#65533;nature&#65533; as a concept. It shows that the meaning attributed to nature is a political process which can have consequences for preventing or enabling significant business organisational activities.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">West Coast</field><field name="subject">Grey District</field><field name="subject">natural resources</field><field name="subject">conservation</field><field name="subject">forests</field><field name="subject">forestry</field><field name="subject">environmental aspects</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080404.142212</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Biochemical and molecular characterisation of bacitracin resistance in Enterococcus faecalis</field><field name="creator">Gauntlett, Jonathan C</field><field name="description">Resistance to the antibiotic bacitracin in Enterococcus faecalis strain AR01/DGVS is conferred by the genes bcrABD that are under the control of the regulatory protein BcrR. The N-terminal domain of BcrR has similarity to the helix-turn-helix motif of DNA-binding proteins and topological modelling predicts that the C-terminal domain contains four transmembrane &#945;-helices. These data have led to the hypothesis that BcrR is a novel transmembrane transcriptional regulator which acts to both sense bacitracin and initiate transcription of bcrABD. The transcription of bcrABD in the presence of bacitracin results in the expression of a putative ABC transporter, BcrAB, that may function by the efflux of bacitracin from the cell membrane. 
 The aim of this study was to further characterise the mechanism of bacitracin resistance in E. faecalis and to conduct structural and functional studies with BcrR. A series of bcrA-lacZ transcriptional fusions were created to investigate the regulation of bcrABD transcription by BcrR and map the bcrABD promoter. We determined that BcrR activates bcrA-lacZ expression in response to bacitracin directly and not indirectly via the build-up of cell wall stress or cell wall precursors. A 69-bp region of the bcrABD promoter was required for activation of bcrA-lacZ expression. The introduction of mutations into this sequence demonstrated that two inverted repeat regions (viz. 5&#65533;-CTGACA(N)&#8326;GTGTC-3&#65533;) were required for bcrA-lacZ expression. Furthermore, the creation of a bcrR::kan insertion mutant and a bcrR-lacZ transcriptional fusion revealed that bcrR is required for high-level bacitracin resistance in AR01/DGVS and that BcrR does not act to auto-regulate bcrR-lacZ expression. 
 To study BcrR function, we overproduced BcrR with a C-terminal hexa-histidine tag in Escherichia coli membranes, extracted the protein with n-dodecyl-&#946;-D-maltoside, and subsequently purified it via Ni&#65533;&#8314;-NTA affinity and gel filtration chromatography to apparent homogeneity. Purified BcrR was reconstituted into liposomes and BcrR binding to bcrABD promoter DNA was analysed using gel-shift assays. We demonstrated that BcrR binds the bcrABD promoter in both the absence and presence of Zn&#65533;&#8314;-bacitracin and that the presence of the inverted repeat regions is necessary for binding. Purification of BcrR has also enabled us to commence structural studies toward obtaining the three dimensional structure of BcrR. We obtained crystals of BcrR that diffracted poorly to a resolution of 19 A&#778;. 
 To characterise the function of the putative ABC type transporter (exporter) of bacitracin, BcrAB, we conducted transport assays with purified bacitracin A, fluorescently labelled FITC-bacitracin A, and radioactive &#8310;&#65533;Ni&#65533;&#8314;-bacitracin. Transport assays conducted with radioactive &#8310;&#65533;Ni&#65533;&#8314;-bacitracin and inverted membrane vesicles of E. coli, in which BcrABD had been recombinantly overproduced, displayed uptake of &#8310;&#65533;Ni&#65533;&#8314;-bacitracin, suggesting that BcrAB functions as a transporter of bacitracin. 
 We conclude that BcrR is a transmembrane DNA-binding protein that functions as both a bacitracin sensor and regulator of bcrABD expression. We propose that BcrR binds to inverted repeat regions in bcrABD promoter to regulate bcrABD expression. Expression of bcrABD results in the production of BcrAB, which appears to be capable of bacitracin efflux (i.e. uptake in inverted membrane vesicles), conferring high-level bacitracin resistance to E. faecalis.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Enterococcus faecalis</field><field name="subject">bacitracin</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080404.143509</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Geographical vector agents</field><field name="creator">Hammam, Yasser</field><field name="description">Simulating geographic phenomena in a realistic and plausible way requires real-world entities to be abstracted based on the dynamic physical characteristics they exhibit, and treated as individuals in a simulation domain. These processes cannot be adequately supported by the traditional spatial model based on cellular-space such as Cellular Automata (CA). Although this approach has received a great attention as a most favoured technique for simulating the geographic phenomena from different aspects, the need for a generic spatial model to overcome the limitations encountered in such an approach has been raised. This applies particularly to the way real-world entities are represented in a simulation domain regarding their physical characteristics and temporal aspects. 
 In this thesis, a new computational approach for a spatial model suitable for simulating geographic phenomena is presented: the vector agents model. The vector agent is goal-oriented, adaptable, physically defined by an Euclidean geometry and able to change its own geometric characteristics while interacting with other agents in its neighbourhood using a set of rules. The agent is modelled with sensor, state, and strategies. The successful implementation of the model&#65533;s architecture allows the representation of the physical characteristics of real-world entities and to observe their complex and dynamic behaviour in a simulation domain. Vector agents have developed out of a need to create a systematic basis for the geometric components of Geographic Automata Systems (GAS), as outlined by Torrens and Benenson (2005). 
 A generic vector agents model was built, then tested and validated from different aspects, from which results demonstrated the model&#65533;s efficiency. It is confirmed that vector agents are flexible in producing different complex shapes and patterns for recreating real geographic phenomena through the generic use of three algorithms of geometric manipulation: midpoint displacement by using the relaxed Brownian Motion (fractal-like) algorithm, edge displacement and vertex displacement. The effectiveness of this was initially ascertained visually. A simple heuristic to govern shape growth rate and complexity was derived based on the interplay of the three algorithms. There was a further abstract model comparison against the cellular-agents environment, with the result that vector agents have the ability to emerge patterns similar to what can be produced by cellular-agents with the advantage of representing entities as individuals with their own attributes with realistic geometric boundaries. On the other hand, the city as a complex geographic phenomenon was used as a specific domain for validating the model with a real-world system. The results of the urban land use simulations (driven by simple rules based on three classical urban theories) confirmed that: (a) the model is flexible enough to incorporate various external rules based on real-world systems and (b) the model has a sufficient capability in emerging a variety of patterns under several environments close to actual patterns. The agent environment also proved to be an effective way of easily combining the rules associated with each urban theory (different agents behaved according to different theories). Finally, limitations raised through the development of this work are addressed leading to outline possible extensions of both model computation and the domain of applications.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">cellular automata</field><field name="subject">data processing</field><field name="subject">land use</field><field name="subject">geographic information systems</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080404.150839</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Participation, urbanism and power</field><field name="creator">Bond, Sophie</field><field name="description">This thesis explores how an adherence to professional principles can be reconciled with a commitment to inclusive participatory planning processes in urban governance. Two themes are drawn together. First, the study concerns recent shifts in thinking about public participation that have resulted in innovative approaches to engaging citizens in urban governance processes through deliberative, interactive workshops and forums. Second, the study focuses on power relations that are inherent in such forums, particularly when a variety of different knowledges (expert and lay) interact. The two themes are brought together by focusing on the participatory practices of the urbanist movement - an urban form movement that draws specific principles from the urbanism of traditional towns and cities in order to create socially and environmentally sustainable places. Within urbanist participation, professional principles for the built environment and a commitment to a form of deliberative democracy are combined. In this study, the crucial question asked is: what is the nature and effect of the power relations on the democratic character of public involvement in participatory planning processes? 
 To explore this issue, two urbanist Enquiry by Design processes were selected as retrospective case studies. One case involved a regeneration project for an inner urban area of a north England industrial town, while the other case involved a greenfield urban extension in the south west of England. The empirical research, undertaken in mid 2005, comprised 52 semi-structured interviews, analysis of extensive background material, and site visits. Research participants were selected to capture a range of perspectives and experiences of each process. 
 To understand the power relations in the cases a two pronged approach was taken. The study was informed by literature from communicative planning theory and deliberative democracy. From this literature, an Ethic for Communicative Participation was developed as a heuristic device to evaluate urbanist participation. Concomitantly, to understand the nature of the power relations involved in the deliberative forum, the study employed a discourse theory perspective after Laclau and Mouffe (2001). Thus, power was understood as relational and imbricated within all social relations, while conflict was conceived of as an indicator of power. 
 The study found that the urbanist discourse, as a hegemonic project, had a significant effect on the nature of the participatory processes. In disseminating and instituting a particular vision for urban sustainability, the urbanist participatory process was found to be instrumental to realising the urbanist vision in each locality. As such, the cases studied displayed a thin commitment to democracy. Moreover, the discursive constructions of concepts of community, representation, consensus and participation evident in the cases, exposed a unified and homogeneous understanding of social groups. Consequently, the complexity of power relations and conflict inherent in the processes were bracketed, resulting in the exclusion of certain perspectives. 
 Nevertheless, the study illustrated the value in understanding the inherently antagonistic nature of the public sphere for both research and practice. The study supported emerging claims for a democratic politics in which antagonism is transformed into agonism - a space of reciprocity and mutual respect in which contestations over meanings can be articulated. In the cases, the participatory space allowed participants to challenge the hegemonic nature of the dominant discourses. Therefore, the thesis argues for two important ways to rethink power in both theory and in practice. First, there must be a willingness to engage with conflict and power. Second, there must be an interrogation of claims to unity or collectivity. Understanding the public sphere as inherently antagonistic, heterogeneous, and criss-crossed with complex power relations potentially provides conditions in which hegemonic forces can be contested. An agonistic politics has the potential to facilitate the open contestation of different knowledges and transform the dominant power relations such that an enhanced democracy can ensue.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Municipal government</field><field name="subject">urbanization</field><field name="subject">social aspects</field><field name="subject">political aspects</field><field name="subject">public relations</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080404.152556</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of film in destination decision-making</field><field name="creator">Croy, William Glen</field><field name="description">The purpose of this research is to create a method and measure the influence of fictional film media in potential tourists&#65533; destination decision-making, using a quasi-experimental method. Film tourism researchers have implied that film plays a direct role in generating tourism. In this research, however, it is proposed that film plays an indirect role through the construction of meaning of place, and therefore destination awareness, availability and evaluation. 
 A two-part multiphase quasi-experimental method was created and implemented to identify change in a destination&#65533;s image due to watching a film. Part One. was qualitative in nature and implemented to discover destination image attributes (evaluative components and decision-making factors) used in destination selection (survey n=202, in-depth interviews n=10). Part One concluded with the compilation of a list of relevant, clear and efficient attributes for Part Two. The list maintained sufficient diversity to define destination image, and was composed of 21 decision-making factors and 40 evaluative components. Part Two then measured the destination&#65533;s image, and change in that image due to watching a feature film (pre and post survey n=67). Change in this quasi-experimental method was assessed by the importance of the attributes being measured, the influence of the film on these attributes and most importantly the combined effect of the film on these attributes. 
 The Vertical Ray of the Sun, a film set in Vietnam, was used to apply and test this innovative quasi-experimental method. The application assessed not only the effect of the film on Vietnam&#65533;s image, but also the applicability of the method. The film positively influenced the respondents&#65533; image of Vietnam. The film had a measured effect on more than half of the attributes. That noted, the actual number of attributes affected to the marked level were 17 out of 61 for the difference in means and only 11 for the eta&#65533; value. Consequently, whilst the film positively affected the image of Vietnam, most of the attributes still needed significant change to modify tourism demand. 
 The thesis importantly contributed to the study of destination image methodologically by asserting the need to assess the importance, influence and effect. This new method can and should be implemented to assess and monitor the effects of many events. This research also contributed by introducing a quasi-experimental cumulative importance-influence measure of effect. The contribution was highlighted in that those attributes with a large influence did not always have a large effect on the destination&#65533;s image. Neither performance by itself, nor importance by itself, can be used as a final effect measure. 
 Finally, this research supports other film-induced tourism studies: film does influence destination image. As presented in more recent studies film-tourism is more likely to be an incidental experience than a reason to visit a place. These more recent studies too may underplay the role of film by focusing on film as an attraction or activity, rather than its role in the actual decision to visit. This research has contributed to film tourism research by highlighting that film can still play a role in the decision-making process, even though it may not be an attraction or a desired experience in itself.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">tourism</field><field name="subject">motion pictures</field><field name="subject">social aspects</field><field name="subject">culture</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080404.155622</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reducing the impact of decision complexity in ambulance command and control</field><field name="creator">Hayes, Jared</field><field name="description">The overriding goal of this work was to present information to ambulance command and control (AC2) operators in a manner that complemented their dispatchers decision making processes whilst minimising the effects of a number of identified complexities. It was theorised that presenting information in this manner would improve the decision making performance of the dispatchers. The initial stages of this work involved identifying the strategies that AC2 operators use when making decisions regarding the allocation of ambulances to emergency incidents and the complexities associated with these decisions. These strategies were identified after the analysis of interviews with AC2 operators using an interview approach called the Critical Decision Method. The subsequent analysis of the interview transcripts using an Emergent Themes Analysis provided a significant number of insights regarding the decision making processes of the operators and the information required to support these decisions. Of particular significance was the importance of situation awareness in the decision making process. For example, when dispatchers have a sound understanding of incidents and additional factors such as the ambulances under their control, the dispatch decision becomes less complicated. 
 To extend the understanding of the dispatcher&#65533;s work in the communication centres, a number of factors that could contribute to the complexity of the dispatch task were identified from an additional analysis of the interview transcripts. However it was not possible to establish from this the contribution of these factors to the perceived complexity encountered by the operators. To address this, a questionnaire was circulated requiring dispatchers to rate the contribution of a number of factors to the complexity of the dispatch task and the frequency that these factors occurred. The results showed that the most prevalent factors related to a number of the cognitive processes that the dispatchers performed to manage the dispatch task. Such processes included determining the resource most likely to arrive at the scene of an emergency incident the quickest. There were also differences in regard to which areas of the dispatch process the dispatchers in the two centres considered to be the most complex. 
 The final stage of this research was the design of a prototype interface that complemented the decision making strategies used by the dispatchers and addressed the identified complexities. At this stage the scope of the research was narrowed to focus primarily on the resource assessment and allocation phases of the dispatch process and several of the complexities associated with these. The prototype interface made use of a novel display technology that allowed the presentation of information across two overlapping LCD displays (referred to as a Multi Layered Display (MLD)). To test the effectiveness of this display a laboratory experiment was conducted comparing the perfomance of participants using the MLD with participants using a Single Layered Display (SLD) that presented the same information. The results indicated that in almost all cases the participants using the multi layer display performed better. However these differences did not prove to be significant.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ambulance service</field><field name="subject">decision making</field><field name="subject">dispatching</field><field name="subject">data processing</field><field name="subject">emergency medical personnel</field><field name="subject">psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080404.160620</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Causes and effects of cardiovascular strain in the heat</field><field name="creator">Morrison, Shawnda A</field><field name="description">Passive and active heat loading causes cardiovascular strain, which can have diverse and substantial effects. Thus, cardiovascular function is integral to work and heat stress tolerance, but recent hyperthermia and exercise literature has not emphasised this relationship, instead focusing on the roles of upper &#65533;critical&#65533; core temperature or rate of heat storage as primary mechanisms of fatigue. Therefore, the aim of this thesis was to examine some potential causes and effects of cardiovascular strain under heat stress, including potential strategies for attenuating that strain. 
 Body precooling before exercise increases heat storage capacity; the primary mechanism by which attenuations in thermal and cardiovascular strain, and improved work capacity is thought to occur. However, no precooling study has utilised realistic airflow in the laboratory, possibly inflating its purported benefits. Therefore, Study One examined the cardiovascular, thermal, psychophysical and ergogenic effects of precooling with and without airflow in the heat (30&#65533;C, 50% rh). Ten males completed four trials in balanced order, comprising 60- min immersion in thermoneutral (35&#65533;C) or cool (24&#65533;C) water before cycling at 95% ventilatory threshold with airflow (~4.8 m&#65533;s&#8315;&#65533;) or no airflow, until exhaustion. Heart rate and mean core, body, and skin temperatures were attenuated for 15 min into cycling after precooling. Endurance time was extended by 30 &#65533; 23 min with airflow, and 16 &#65533; 15 min with precooling relative to control (28 &#65533; 12 min) but not further extended with strategies combined (29 &#65533; 21 min). Precooling removed 784 &#65533; 223 kJ&#65533;m&#8315;&#65533; (calorimetrically); less than the effect of airflow alone (1323 &#65533; 1128 kJ&#65533;m&#8315;&#65533;). 
 Competition for blood between tissues is pronounced during exercise in the heat: skin and gut have marked increases and decreases, respectively. Gut ischemia affects epithelial tight junction integrity, allowing lippopolysaccharide ingress and immune responses. Bovine colostrum may attenuate gut permeability. Study Two (double-blind, placebo controlled) investigated the effects of aerobic fitness (7 highly fit, 8 moderately fit) and bovine colostrum on physiological and perceived strain, and performance during mixed-mode exercise; cycle 15 min at 50% maximal heart rate range (HRR), run 30 min at 80% HRR then 30 min self-selected paced before another 15 min cycle at the same work-rate. Airflow was graded to running speed. During the last cycle, blood pressure, stroke volume and total peripheral resistance were lower, heart rate and skin blood flow increased, and skin temperature was unchanged compared to the first cycle. Indices of fever response (IL-1&#946;, TNF-&#945;) were not evident during exercise, nor were those of blood-brain barrier permeability (S100&#946;) or cognitive impairment (Stroop test). Neither bovine colostrum, nor higher fitness modified these measures. 
 Moving to upright posture is orthostatically stressful and can initially decrease cerebral perfusion. Compression garments are used to assist venous return; while their effectiveness is unknown, they could reduce heat or orthostatic-induced hypoperfusion. Study Three investigated the cardiovascular and cerebrovascular responses to orthostatic stress with and without passive heating (+0.5&#65533;C). Fifteen participants completed two trials (compression v placebo garments) in balanced order. Cerebral autoregulation was assessed via 3-min stand, and via thigh cuff inflation. All participants experienced initial orthostatic hypotension upon standing in one or more trials, with 4/15 individuals experiencing presyncopal symptoms, aborting the standing protocol. In those who "fainted", reductions in blood pressure and partial pressure of end-tidal CO&#8322; reduced middle cerebral artery velocity. Neither training status nor compression trousers modified the responses. 
 Collectively, cardiovascular strain to heat stress is attenuated when realistic airflow is provided. Increased cardiovascular strain does not inevitably result in clinical outcomes to heat stress. Higher fitness does not necessarily attenuate cardiovascular responses or higher tolerance to heat stress.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">stress (physiology)</field><field name="subject">homeostasis</field><field name="subject">effect of heat</field><field name="subject">heat</field><field name="subject">physiological effect</field><field name="subject">cardiovascular system</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080404.162058</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The bovine mammary gland immune response to Streptococcus uberis and its bacteriocins</field><field name="creator">Swanson, Kara M</field><field name="description">Bovine mastitis is one of the most costly dairy-based diseases worldwide.

Microarray technology was used to evaluate the complex transcriptional changes which occur in the bovine mammary gland following the onset of clinical S. uberis mastitis. A 22,000 bovine cDNA microarray indicated that S. uberis mastitis led to the up-regulation of 1,283 genes and the down-regulation of 1,237 genes by greater than 1.5 fold. Gene ontology analysis demonstrated that S. uberis mastitis was typically associated with the up-regulation of genes that are involved in the immune response and homeostasis and a down-regulation of genes involved in lipid metabolism. Quantitative real-time analyses for a selection of genes associated with the immune response validated the microarray data. Mammary epithelial cell cultures did not show an increase in the expression of any of these immune factors in response to the same S. uberis strain used to induce clinical mastitis. This indicates that the expression of immune-related genes by mammary epithelial cells may be initiated by host factors and not S. uberis. 
 The application of bacteriocins, proteinaceous antimicrobials produced by bacteria which typically inhibit the same or closely-related species to that of the producer organism, has been suggested as one possible approach in the control of mastitis. S. uberis have been previously found to commonly produce bacteriocin-like inhibitory substances (BLIS). The BLIS activities of a set of fifteen S. uberis and S. bovis strains were assessed. The results confirmed the prolific and varied nature of BLIS production by S. uberis and S. bovis and also indicated that these strains may commonly produce more than one inhibitory agent. This survey of BLIS production led to the detection and characterisation of a novel circular bacteriocin, uberolysin, produced by S. uberis strains 233 and 42. The structural gene of uberolysin was subsequently identified in nine (64%) of the fifteen test strains. 
 Multiplex PCR analysis showed that 93% of 158 New Zealand S. uberis isolates contained the structural genes of at least one of the four known S. uberis bacteriocins (uberolysin, nisin U, ubericin A and ubericin 63). However, no apparent direct association was identified between any one of these bacteriocin-related loci and apparent ability to cause mastitis on New Zealand dairy farms. The uberolysin structural gene was detected in 91% of the isolates and this widespread distribution prompted the advancement and evaluation of a potential role for uberolysin in immunomodulation within the bovine mammary gland. Two different preparations of uberolysin were found to have different stimulatory effects on monocytes, neutrophils and epithelial cells. The less highly purified preparation appeared to diminish the production of TNF-&#945; by monocytes in the presence of a bacterial stimulus and to decrease neutrophil phagocytosis. By contrast, the relatively more highly purified preparation of uberolysin itself induced a significant immune response by monocytes. Consistent with this, the purer preparation of uberolysin induced an increase in C3, IL-1&#946;, IL-6, IL-8, the &#946;-defensin LAP, the acute-phase protein MSAA, the calcium-binding protein S100A12 and TLR2 by quantitative real-time analysis. 
 Although currently only two S. uberis bacteriocins (uberolysin and nisin U) have been fully characterised, the present study has shown that this species may be an important source of novel antimicrobials. Furthermore, bacteriocin production by S. uberis may have an immunomodulation role within the mammary gland. A better understanding of the complex immune response initiated at the onset of clinical S. uberis mastitis and of the role that bacteriocins have in S. uberis pathogenesis may lead to development of improved strategies to combat this disease.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Streptococcus uberis</field><field name="subject">mastitis</field><field name="subject">molecular aspects</field><field name="subject">bacteriocins</field><field name="subject">mammary glands</field><field name="subject">immunology</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080407.112302</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The functions of p53 during an adenovirus infection</field><field name="creator">Campbell, Hamish George</field><field name="description">p53 is a pivotal tumour suppressor in mammalian cells. It protects the integrity of a number of cellular pathways, preventing the malignant transformation of cells. There is however perhaps nothing more efficient at disrupting cellular pathways than a virus. Viruses infiltrate cells commandeering the normal growth and survival pathways for their narcissistic needs. While the association between viral infections and the induction of p53 has long been recognised, there is controversy surrounding the ultimate role of p53 during a virus infection. The classical model of p53 in an adenovirus infection is that p53 is a formidable obstacle which needs to be overcome. Adenoviruses overcome p53 by degrading the protein and removing its ability to transactivate its target genes. However the degradation is not immediate and there is increasing evidence which would suggest p53 is actually beneficial to an adenovirus infection. In the introductory chapter, I review what is known about p53 and virus infections. What emerges from this review is the sheer number of interactions that occur between viruses and p53, indicating its importance in an infection. Additionally it shows that adenoviruses are not the only virus shown to benefit from the presence of p53. 
 What beneficial role p53 may be fulfilling in an adenovirus infection is unclear. The experiments reported in this thesis investigate the functions of p53 in an adenovirus infection. In Chapter Three, immunoblots on a panel of adenovirus infected cells reveal that p53 levels do not correlate with the level of the classical p53 target proteins. This indicates that p53 is disconnected from its target genes during an infection. Promoter/reporter assays carried out on infected cells show that adenovirus can directly regulate p53 target genes independently of p53. In Chapter Five, I show this regulation is dependent on E1a, with transient transfection of E1a resulting in the marked activation of p53 target promoters. E1a mediated transactivation appears to be reliant on the largest splice variant of E1a (E1a-289R) and the presence of pRB. Electrophoresis mobility shift assays reveal that the transcription factor Sp1 is involved. 
 In Chapter Four, p53 transcription in an adenovirus infection was directly assayed by using an artificial p53 consensus response element. The results show that p53 is unable to activate its consensus response element during an infection. However, I show that p53 is transcriptionally competent in an infection, and is able to transactivate a mutant derivative of the p53 consensus sequence. This shows that p53 is not only transcriptional competent but has a gain-of-function in an infection. This gain-of-function requires E1a, and appears not to be due to a change in the DNA binding affinity of p53. 
 The data in this thesis show that adenoviruses not only appear to inhibit and control the normal transcriptional profile of p53 but appear to modify p53, giving it a new transcriptional profile. This provides a possible mechanism by which p53 could aid an adenovirus infection.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">p53 antioncogene</field><field name="subject">antioncogenes</field><field name="subject">adenovirus diseases</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080411.115504</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Implementation of enterprise systems : a process view</field><field name="creator">Madhavan, Thiruvenkatachari</field><field name="description">During the 1990s, many organizations across the globe migrated existing information systems to Enterprise Systems (ES) packages, which promised both business and technical solutions to their existing sets of problems. However, ES implementations have gained notoriety for not meeting budgeted expenditures and schedules. Such events have warranted academic research to gain an understanding about the role of ES packages and the importance of ES implementation. A large number of academic researchers have adopted a variance approach to examine ES implementation. As a result they have identified a range of critical success factors said to be influential in achieving successful implementation of ES packages. An alternate perspective for researching ES implementation is the process approach but this has remained largely neglected in academic debates. Furthermore, it has still not been possible for researchers or practitioners to understand the degree to which specific critical success factors, or other considerations, might be influential in any given ES implementation, either pre- or post-project. 
 This research therefore adopts the process approach to examine ES implementations. The process approach is focused on explaining an outcome, given a set of activities. This research draws upon the work of Markus and Tanis (2000) and O&#65533;Leary (2000), who have established frameworks to explain an outcome (success or failure) of ES implementations. In addition, this research draws on the work of Davenport (2000) and Brehm et al. (2001), who have established models that outline activities related to configuration of business and software processes during implementation of ES packages. To enable this inquiry, a single case study (site) was chosen, to expose the actions and events that transpired during the implementation of an ES package. 
 This research concludes that the framework of O&#65533;Leary (2000) is better suited to explain the outcome of an ES Implementation than the framework of Markus and Tanis (2000). The framework of Markus and Tanis (2000) was found to be useful in understanding the implementation process of an ES package. 
 In addition, this research developed a novel model that portrays a comprehensive set of activities, undertaken by the case organization during the configuration of business and software processes. This model traversed the 'High-Level', 'Detailed Development' and 'Implementation' stages of the configuration process. It is asserted that this model is a significant improvement when compared to models presented by Davenport (2000) and Brehm et al. (2001). This research also explored some of the issues of the case study that did not fit neatly into the existing theoretic frameworks employed. 
 Six issues emerged in this regard; 'Selection of industry specific ES package solution'; 'Selection of Proven Implementation Partner'; 'Project Planning and Management'; 'Incremental Implementation Strategy'; 'Ownership of the ES Project' and 'Selection of Best Practice Business Processes'. It is contended that each have played a critical role in the successful deployment of the ES package at this case site.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">management</field><field name="subject">information</field><field name="subject">systems</field><field name="subject">storage</field><field name="subject">retrieval</field><field name="subject">evaluation</field><field name="subject">equipment</field><field name="subject">supplies</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080414.160905</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Constituting queer : performativity and commodity culture</field><field name="creator">Brady, Anita</field><field name="description">This thesis foregrounds a question unanswered in queer theory&#65533;s account of the ongoing reproduction of heteronormativity. In Gender Trouble, Judith Butler asks "From where does the performative draw its force, and what happens to the performative whose task it is to undo" that discursively legitimated enacting? (Bodies That Matter 224-5). While queer theory offers a compelling account of how the normative fictions of identity privilege heterosexuality, the first part of Butler&#65533;s question remains relatively under-theorised. This thesis addresses this gap and argues that to understand the source of performative authority, we must address the intimate relationship between gay identity and commodity culture. Thus, I investigate the connections between the marketing industry, an historically politicised gay press, and a lesbian and gay politics imagined through the paradigm of identity, and argue that they combine in a citational feedback loop to performatively produce gay identity as the "ideal consumer." I then undertake case studies of two media texts, the website Gay.com and the television series Queer Eye for the Straight Guy, in order to demonstrate how the white, male, middle-class gay aesthete functions hegemonically as gayness in culture. 
 My analysis then turns to the second part of Butler&#65533;s question -"what happens to the performative whose task it is to undo?"- and examines the consequences of the absence of an analysis of commodity culture for the notion of queer. To that end, I suggest that alongside their repetitions of gay normativity, both Gay.com and Queer Eye perform queer possibility. However, the case studies I undertake, along with the critical reception of Queer Eye and the internet technologies behind Gay.com, suggests that these media texts fall short of the promise of queerness. This apparent failure to disturb heteronormative reproduction is connected in these critiques to each text&#65533;s commercial imperatives. This thesis argues that such critiques tend to rely on determinations of the authenticity of queer performance, and emphasise veracity over queer theory&#65533;s potential to exploit the critical potential of deliberate indeterminacy. I argue, instead, that a key part of queer theory&#65533;s contingency is its capacity to respond to the changing performative contexts of the normative repetitions it seeks to undo. To put this more simply: If consumer desire defines contemporary gayness, then it is with consumer desire that queer theory must contend. It is precisely the indeterminacy of queer that enables such shifts in its strategies of subversion. Recognition of how queer&#65533;s indeterminacy enables those subversive moves returns us to the importance to queer theory of a sustained consideration of the constitutive capacities of commodity culture. What I suggest in this thesis is that if we do no ask "From where does the performance draw its force?" then we cannot answer "And what happens to the performative whose task it is to undo?" the normative framework of identity.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">queer theory</field><field name="subject">gender</field><field name="subject">identity</field><field name="subject">philosophy</field><field name="subject">gays</field><field name="subject">homosexuality</field><field name="subject">lesbianism</field><field name="subject">gay consumers</field><field name="subject">lesbian consumers</field><field name="subject">queer eye for the straight guy (television program)</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080429.113540</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The roles of key species and functional guilds in facilitating fluxes of organic matter across habitat boundaries in Fiordland</field><field name="creator">McLeod, Rebecca Jane</field><field name="description">The secondary productivity of communities is inherently influenced by the availability and quality of food resources. Movement of organic matter (OM) across landscapes can connect adjacent systems by providing subsidies of carbon and nutrients, implying that alterations of environments from their natural state may affect the productivity of neighboring food webs. The intact terrestrial and marine environments of Fiordland provide a setting to study linkages between the land and the sea. The first general objective of this study was to determine if large but nutritionally poor (nitrogen-poor, carbon-rich) inputs of forest litter support marine secondary production, and to identify pathways for incorporation of this material into upper trophic levels. Pools of marine and terrestrial OM had distinct values of [delta]&#65533;&#8309;N, [delta]&#65533;&#65533;C and [delta]&#65533;&#8308;S, providing high power to estimate the relative use of these sources by the food webs of the fjord-head deltas. Deposit feeding invertebrates (e.g. Echinocardium cordatum, Pectinaria australis) directly assimilated plant detritus. Heterotrophic bacteria on the surface of the sediment assimilated forest litter and provided a potential food source for invertebrates. Chemoautotrophic bacteria fix CO&#8322; that originates from decomposing forest litter, thus providing an indirect pathway for incorporation of forest litter into the food webs. In the deep basins the strength of the flux of uptake by chemoautotrophic bacteria through the benthic food web into the upper trophic levels was demonstrated by hagfish (Eptatretus cirrhatus) obtaining 38-51% of their nutrition from these bacteria. 
 The ability of a community to utilize discrete sources of OM relies on the presence of specific functional feeding guilds. Marine algae provide a highly nutritive (nitrogen-rich) food source for the fjord communities and fluxes of algae into food webs are facilitated by grazing invertebrates and filter feeders. The second general objective of this study was to determine how the effective loss of filter feeders from inner Doubtful Sound would alter the flux of marine-derived OM to the food webs of the delta communities. The low salinity environment imposed by the hydroelectric power station in Doubtful Sound caused a large reduction in the abundance of the infaunal bivalves Austrovenus stutchburyi and Paphies australis from delta habitats. Clams could tolerate periods of freshwater exposure of [less than or equal to]20 days duration, but the constant freshwater conditions in Doubtful Sound decreased survivorship. In 2004/05 the biomass of these species in inner Doubtful Sound (7.28 tonnes) was 29 times smaller than in Bradshaw Sound (214.12 tonnes). The associated loss of biodeposits (~91 tonnes(DW) yr&#8315;&#65533; in Bradshaw Sound vs. 1 tonne(DW) yr&#8315;&#65533; in inner Doubtful Sound) may have also altered the flux of nutritive OM to the infaunal community. The river delta communities in inner Doubtful Sound appear to have a higher reliance on forest litter than those in Bradshaw Sound, which is apparent as low values of [delta]&#65533;&#8309;N and [delta]&#65533;&#65533;C for estuarine fish (Notolabrus celidotus, Hemerocoetes monopterygius), which act as integrators of the benthic community. 
 This study demonstrates important linkages between terrestrial and coastal marine ecosystems and highlights the role of functional diversity in facilitating fluxes of organic material through food webs.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">West Coast</field><field name="subject">ecosystems</field><field name="subject">biotic communities</field><field name="subject">species diversity</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080505.131451</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sepulture perpetuelle : New Zealand and Gallipoli : possession, preservation and pilgrimage 1916-1965</field><field name="creator">Mackay, Christopher Don</field><field name="description">Constructions of memory, myth and legend relating to Gallipoli have dominated the academic assumption which suggests that this dimension alone has allowed for the reawakening of the exceptional interest in the Anzac tradition; a tradition that has converged at the physical site in modern day Turkey. While these intangible constructions have waxed, waned, and re-emerged over the Twentieth Century, possessing the site to commence the construction of an Anzac Battlefield Cemetery has been ignored in academic enquiry. This significant series of events from 1916 to 1965 were indispensable to memory perpetuation and essential to the commemorative primacy that this preserved headland now enjoys. The desire to repossess, and then own in perpetuity the battlefield in order to attach the appropriate masonry adornments, is in itself unique. This dimension has not been academically scrutinised by any historian until now. Nor has the deliberate desire to construct an Anzac shrine that would someday attract pilgrims from the Antipodes been studied. Present day site-sacralisation by rite-of-passage pilgrims, thoroughly emersed in the Anzac tradition, suggests the convergence of the two dimensions is complete. 
 To counteract this problem of the &#65533;hegemony of the intangibles&#65533; this thesis explores primary sources, gleaned largely from archival records, then evaluates the significance of the history of &#65533;physical Gallipoli.&#65533; Thematic approaches based upon the lines of possession, preservation and pilgrimage argue that this parallel dimension has played an indispensable role in shaping the end result today. Tens of thousands Australasian travellers now flock to this preserved battlefield to encounter the actual physicality of the tradition. The battlefield cemetery, complete with botanical emblems of ownership, had been out of the reach of the very generation who had created, acquired and constructed the battlefield landscape. The New Zealand public had to be content with assorted forms of vicarious pilgrimage coupled with widespread domestic memorialisation. 
 New Zealand&#65533;s post-evacuation experience at Gallipoli became a story completely distinctive from that of Australia or Great Britain. The deliberately constructed Anzac Battlefield Cemetery is a unique landscape artefact that a proud but mournful generation set out to create. They eventually achieved this end by a complicated mixture of conquest, occupation, careful preservation, and commemorative ownership. These efforts were assisted by the vagaries of economic happenstance and international politics that left this remote Peninsula isolated and off-limits to human encounter. Fortuitously frozen in time, this landscape artefact, so steeped in Classical history, has emerged as one of the most sacred, and perhaps the most recognisable, geographic features associated with Australasia. Overriding these plans for shrine construction had been the stated goal of securing a reverent final resting place for those who fell during the creation of the Anzac legend in 1915. Sepulture perpetuelle became the post-evacuation catchphrase that propelled this Great War generation to go almost to the brink of war to secure the principles of this phrase. This lofty goal of permanence, by passage of time and the re-appropriation of nature, had mercifully been completed before the current &#65533;second invasion&#65533; that commenced in the 1980s. The Anzac Battlefield Cemetery is now a victim of its own very successful physical preservation.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Turkey</field><field name="subject">Gallipoli Peninsula</field><field name="subject">Great Britain</field><field name="subject">New Zealanders</field><field name="subject">travel</field><field name="subject">cemetaries</field><field name="subject">army</field><field name="subject">Australian and New Zealand Army Corps</field><field name="subject">history</field><field name="subject">World War</field><field name="subject">1914-1918</field><field name="subject">campaigns</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070504.145719</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Without motion there cannot be any life : the rise &amp; fall of the 1889 Railway Commissioners : railway management &amp; colonial politics in nineteenth century New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Smith, Bruce H</field><field name="description">In the nineteenth century, the steam railway became, for many people, the superior conduit for the inland translocation of people and freight. Once devised, steam railways offered such a huge improvement on previous modes and made such a dramatic change to the unity, organisation and commerce of most countries that almost everyone wanted one. New Zealand proved no different, but was faced with not only the twin problems of low population and often rugged geography, but also serious economic problems from difficult world trading conditions and a debt greatly increased by railway construction costs. In the later 1880s, a conservative government decided to vest the Government Railways in independent Commissioners to try to improve productivity and cut out political influence, corruption and jobbery in the huge commercial presence the colony&#65533;s railways represented. While this move was successful, a change to one-man-one-vote, together with the pivotal 1890 Maritime Strike, saw the country move left in the elections of 1890, bringing to power a Liberal Government. This new Ministry then set out to reduce the autonomy of the Railway Commissioners, taking four years to return the management of Railways to the direct control of the Government. 
 While interesting in itself, this is part of the story of the process of the democratic development of New Zealand. This was a community struggling with the often conflicting demands of using railways to not only service the railway debt but also fulfil public transit requirements, including encouraging settlement and economic growth. The organisation&#65533;s monopolistic nature and great economic presence, however, offered multiple, including corrupt, opportunities to support the political aspirations of those in power, while offering a less than wonderful service to its customers. Taking place against a backdrop of agitation for railway reform, particularly orchestrated by railway activist Samuel Vaile, the outcome can be seen to have been less than completely desirable for the economic development of the country or its people. This was despite huge support for the principal activist against the Railway Commissioners, Liberal Premier Richard Seddon.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">New Zealand Railways</field><field name="subject">railways</field><field name="subject">19th century</field><field name="subject">politics</field><field name="subject">government</field><field name="subject">management</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070619.154352</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Definitions of obedience in Paradise regained</field><field name="creator">Learmonth, Nicola K</field><field name="description">The thesis has two parts. Part One surveys the debate on how to define Christian obedience and Milton&#65533;s prose contributions to that discourse. In the century leading up to Milton&#65533;s prose writings there was much debate in England over how to define spiritual obedience. Civil authorities argued that matters of religion fell within state jurisdiction and that an individual&#65533;s spiritual obedience should be subject to outward scrutiny and external control; but these definitions were contested by Protestant reformers. Chapter One traces the issue up to Milton&#65533;s contributions. 
 Chapter Two traces Milton&#65533;s thinking about obedience, spiritual and secular, through his own prose writings: Milton defines obedience as a responsible freedom which requires continual critical assessment of authority. In reaction to the political and ecclesiastical developments of his own time, Milton places increasing emphasis on the role of the individual in defining and expressing obedience to God by means of scriptural study and open discussion. Milton argues that liberty is a necessary pre-condition for giving true obedience to God, and this idea comes to the fore in the later prose tracts, which respond to political and ecclesiastical developments that Milton interpreted as threatening the individual&#65533;s liberty of conscience. 
 Part Two examines Paradise Regained (1671), in which Milton advances his interpretation of obedience through his characterisation of the Son of God. Chapter Three shows how Milton links those forms of Christian obedience which he rejects in his prose writing to either Satan or satanic influence. Through his depiction of the Son&#65533;s responses to Satan, Milton indicates that Satan&#65533;s versions of obedience are designed to distract the Son, and any other believer, from giving proper obedience to God. 
 Chapter Four traces how Milton&#65533;s depiction of the Son of God demonstrates his understanding of the right reasons for, and ways of, giving proper obedience to God. The Son&#65533;s firm obedience is a state of mind and comprises knowledge of God through scriptural study, conversation and meditation. This exemplary obedience is motivated by an appreciation for and desire to participate in God&#65533;s glory (ie., Creation), and Milton indicates that it is this appreciation of divine glory that enables the Son of God to successfully resist Satan&#65533;s temptations. 
 Chapter Five examines Milton&#65533;s final episode, the pinnacle temptation, in terms of the obedience which he has approved throughout the poem. This chapter addresses Milton&#65533;s handling of the reader&#65533;s expectations for this scene, and the symbolic language and setting of the pinnacle episode. Unlike any other writers on the temptations in the wilderness, Milton invests the Son&#65533;s victory (and Satan&#65533;s defeat) on the pinnacle with symbolic power by depicting the Son standing in firm obedience to God. Thus Milton presents his reader with the definitive expression of humanity&#65533;s obedience to God: the Son&#65533;s stand is a symbolic return to the "Godlike erect" stance ascribed to prelapsarian humanity in Paradise Lost (PL, IV.289), and with this firm, upright obedience Milton shows the rest of humanity how to regain Paradise.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">John Milton (1608-1674)</field><field name="subject">Paradise regained</field><field name="subject">obedience</field><field name="subject">religion</field><field name="subject">christianity</field><field name="subject">literature</field><field name="subject">Son of God</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20071108.162331</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Farm women : diverse encounters with discourse and agency</field><field name="creator">Peoples, Susan J</field><field name="description">This thesis contributes to the established literature on farm women within the context of family farming. It recognises that not enough is yet known about the discourses and agency which influence their lives. Consequently, this study has sought to establish what dominant discourses shape the lives of farm women, their responses to these discourses and how their discursive positioning influences their agency. 
 This study employed a qualitative case study approach involving interviews with a diverse mixture of independent farm women, along with women farming in marital relationships. This thesis engages these narratives to showcase the colourful, complex life-experiences of farm women. In addition, and where present, women&#65533;s partners were interviewed to provide male farmers&#65533; perspectives about women in family farming. 
 This research has found that women&#65533;s lives are shaped by positioning and contextualising discourses, with which they comply to ensure that the family farm survives. Their subservient discursive positioning limits the agency they can express, although they are able to mobilise indirect agency through supporting their partner; an implicit form of agency which has previously been unrecognised or understated. 
 Cumulatively, this thesis highlights the need to recognise the diversity of farm women, and how they are able to exercise agency from their constrained subject positions within the family farming context. Furthermore it emphasises that agency is a dynamic, and far more varied concept than previously understood.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">women</field><field name="subject">rural</field><field name="subject">farmers</field><field name="subject">language</field><field name="subject">agriculture</field><field name="subject">family</field><field name="subject">farms</field><field name="subject">discourse analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20071127.160311</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Movement coordination in a discrete multi-articular action from a dynamical systems perspective</field><field name="creator">Rein, Robert</field><field name="description">Dynamical systems theory represents a prominent theoretical framework for the investigation of movement coordination and control in complex neurobiological systems. Central to this theory is the investigation of pattern formation in biological movement through application of tools from nonlinear dynamics. Movement patterns are regarded as attractors and changes in movement coordination can be described as phase transitions. Phase transitions typically exhibit certain key indicators like critical fluctuations, critical slowing down and hysteresis, which enable the formulation of hypotheses and experimental testing. An extensive body of literature exists which tested these characteristics and robustly supports the tenets of dynamical systems theory in the movement sciences. However, the majority of studies have tended to use a limited range of movement models for experimentation, mainly bimanual rhythmical movements, and at present it is not clear to what extent the results can be transferred to other domains such as discrete movements and/or multi-articular actions. 
 The present work investigated coordination and control of discrete, multi-articular actions as exemplified by a movement model from the sports domain: the basketball hook shot. Accordingly, the aims of the research programme were three-fold. First, identification of an appropriate movement model. Second, development of an analytical apparatus to enable the application of dynamical systems theory to new movement models. Third, to relate key principles of dynamical systems theory to investigations of this new movement model. 
 A summary of four related studies that were undertaken is as follows: 1. Based on a biomechanical analysis, the kinematics of the basketball hook shot in four participants of different skill levels were investigated. Participants were asked to throw from different shooting distances, which were varied in a systematic manner between 2m and 9m in two different conditions (with and without a defender present). There was a common significant trend for increasing throwing velocity paired with increasing wrist trajectory radii as shooting distance increased. Continuous angle kinematics showed high levels of inter- and intra-individual variability particularly related to throwing distance. Comparison of the kinematics when throwing with and without a defender present indicated differences for a novice performer, but not for more skilled individuals. In summary, the basketball hook shot is a suitable movement model for investigating the application of dynamical systems theory to a discrete, multi-articular movement model where throwing distance resembles a candidate control parameter. 
 2. Experimentation under the dynamical systems theoretical paradigm usually entails the systematic variation of a candidate control parameter in a scaling procedure. However there is no consensus regarding a suitable analysis procedure for discrete, multiarticular actions. Extending upon previous approaches, a cluster analysis method was developed which made the systematic identification of different movement patterns possible. The validity of the analysis method was demonstrated using distinct movement models: 1) bimanual, wrist movement, 2) three different basketball shots, 3) a basketball hook shot scaling experiment. In study 1, the results obtained from the cluster analysis approach matched results obtained by a traditional analysis using discrete relative phase. In study 2, the results from the method matched the a-priori known distinction into three different basketball techniques. Study 3 was designed specifically to facilitate a bimodal throwing pattern due to laboratory restrictions in throwing height. The cluster analysis again was able to identify the a-priori known distribution. Additionally, a hysteresis effect for throwing distance was identified further strengthening the validity of the chosen movement model. 
 3. Using eight participants, hook shot throwing distance was varied between 2m and 9m in both directions. Some distinct inter-individual differences were found in regards to movement patterning. For two subjects clear transitions between qualitatively distinct different patterns could be established. However, no qualitative differences were apparent for the remaining participants where it was suggested that a single movement pattern was continually scaled according to the throwing distance. The data supported the concept of degeneracy in that once additional movement degrees of freedom are made available these can be exploited by actors. The underlying attractor dynamics for the basketball hook shot were quite distinct from the bistable regime typically observed in rhythmical bimanual movement models. 
 4. To provide further evidence in support of the view that observed changes in movement patterning during a hook shot represented a phase transition, a perturbation experiment with five participants was performed. Throwing distance was once again varied in a scaling manner between 2m and 9m. The participants wore a wristband which could be attached to a weight which served as a mechanical perturbation to the throwing movement. Investigation of relaxation time-scales did not provide any evidence for critical slowing down. The movements showed high variation between all subsequent trials and no systematic variation in relation to either the mechanical perturbation or the successive jumps in throwing distance was indicated by the data. 
 In summary, the results of the research programme highlighted some important differences between discrete multi-articular and bimanual rhythmical movement models. Based on these differences many of the findings ubiquitous in the domain of rhythmical movements may be specific to these and accordingly may not be readily generalized to movement models from other domains. This highlights the need for more research focussing on various movement models in order to broaden the scope of the dynamical systems framework and enhance further insight into movement coordination and control in complex neurobiological systems.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">differentiable dynamical systems</field><field name="subject">basketball</field><field name="subject">shooting</field><field name="subject">human mechanics</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080125.144336</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The politics of inheritance? : the language of inheritance in Romans within its first-century Greco-Roman Imperial context</field><field name="creator">Forman, Mark</field><field name="description">This thesis is an exploration of the extent to which Paul&#65533;s terminology of Inheritance [(...)] in Romans, and its associated imagery, logic and arguments, functioned to evoke socio-political expectations that were alternative to those which prevailed in contemporary Roman imperial discourse. 
 There are two parts to this study. The first is to take seriously the context of Empire and the claims being made by the Roman Empire in the first century. In particular, what were some of the messages conveyed by the Roman Empire with regard to the structure and purpose, the hopes and expectations, of first-century society? The Christians in Rome were daily exposed to the images and message of Caesar and his successors and there is therefore a need to consider how Paul&#65533;s language of Inheritance would have sounded within this environment. 
 Second, this study gives attention to the content of Paul&#65533;s use of the word "inheritance" as it occurs in Romans. In order to address this question, three interrelated ideas are explored. First, for Paul, what does the inheritance consist of? The traditional understanding is that the concept is an entirely spiritualised or transcendent reality. This study proposes a more this-worldly, geographical nature to the word. Second, there is the closely related question of the political nature of inheritance. If it is the case that the language of inheritance has to do with the renewal of the land, then who inherits this land? These two questions raise a third issue-how will the inheritance transpire? Paul&#65533;s inheritance language contributes to notions of lordship, authority and universal sovereignty for the people of God. Conceivably, the path to this dominion could mirror the hegemonic intentions of imperial Rome which envisages the triumph of one group of people (the strong) over another (the weak). Is this the case with Paul&#65533;s inheritance language, or does it somehow undermine all claims to power and control? 
 There are five undisputed uses of [...] and its cognates in Romans-Rom 4:13, 14; Rom 8:17 (three times) and there is one textual variant in Rom 11:1 where the word [...] is used in place of [...]. This study finds that, to varying degrees in each of these texts, the inheritance concept is not only a direct confrontation to other claims to rule, it is also simultaneously a reversal of all other paths to lordship and rule. 
 This study then considers the use of the concept in the two other undisputed Pauline letters where it occurs (Galatians and 1 Corinthians) and also in the disputed letter to the Colossians. The overriding impression is that there is nothing in Galatians, 1 Corinthians or Colossians which significantly challenges the this-worldly, political nature of the language of inheritance in Romans. In these epistles and in Romans Paul employs the language and politics of inheritance in order to subvert the message of Empire.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bible</field><field name="subject">New Testament</field><field name="subject">Romans</field><field name="subject">theology</field><field name="subject">language</field><field name="subject">style</field><field name="subject">Epistles of Paul</field><field name="subject">emperor worship</field><field name="subject">Rome</field><field name="subject">legitimacy of governments</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080128.161919</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fluid forces on an accelerating hand in swimming</field><field name="creator">Kudo, Shigetada</field><field name="description">This study examines the effects of acceleration on fluid forces acting on the hand in swimming and presents a new pressure method to predict fluid forces acting on the accelerating hand. 
 Swimmers and coaches require accurate information about swimmers&#65533; fluid forces, propulsion and drag, in order to improve performance. In general, swimmers are likely to generate propulsion mainly with their hands in the front crawl stroke, butterfly and back crawl stroke. Researchers have attempted to estimate the fluid forces on the hands with various techniques including a cinematographic method (a "quasi-static" approach), a pressure method and a numerical method of computational fluid dynamics. However, the effect of accelerations on fluid forces acting on the hand has not yet been well quantified. Understanding of the effect of acceleration on fluid forces on the hand can provide useful information to enhance swimming performance. Also the developments of a method to predict fluid forces acting on the accelerating hand in swimming can be used to evaluate swimming performance more accurately. The present study used a hand model attached to a load cell to measure forces in three orthogonal directions and pressure sensors to measure pressures on the hand model rotated in the flume. The model position was measured by a potentiometer fixed to the axis of the model rotation. 
 The quantification of the effect of acceleration was based on a simple theoretical understanding for fluid mechanics, using the inertia coefficients and the coefficients of fluid forces, that is widely accepted in other disciplines. The quantification was focused mainly in the direction tangential to the model rotation because the magnitude of the velocity changed in this direction. The overall effect of acceleration on fluid forces on the hand model was that the inertia coefficients increased rapidly in the early phase of the model movement, then in the final deceleration phase of model movement the inertia coefficients decreased to a negative value and then became small. The inertia coefficient increased in the impulsive start of the hand model, indicating that fluid forces acting on the hand increased as accelerations of the hand increased. This result was consistent with the simple theoretical understanding to induce additional fluid forces on the hand, that is, fluid forces on the hand increased as accelerations increased. However, the inertia coefficient decreased and reached large negative values in the late phase of the model movement involving decelerated motion, indicating that fluid forces on the hand increased as acceleration of the hand decreased to negative values (decelerations). That result was not consistent with the simple theoretical understanding to induce additional fluid forces on the hand because the simple theoretical understanding cannot take account of the preceding history of the fluid motion around the hand model associated with the formation of vortices. Thus, more sophisticated theory is needed. The dynamic pressure measured by the pressure sensors implied that the induced fluid forces might be due to large attached vortices behind the hand model. 
 The hand was considered as a blunt body when the angle of attack was large (maximum = 90&#65533;) and an aerofoil shape when the angle of attack was small. The inertia coefficients became large when the hand model was set at the large angles of attack, indicating that the effect of accelerations on the hand model increased when the hand surface was directed to the on-coming flows (blunt body). 
 For the development of the new pressure method, a regression analysis was used to build a single best-fit equation to predict fluid forces acting on the accelerating hand model. The single best-fit equation was acquired for various orientations of the hand model. The accuracy of prediction of fluid forces acting on the accelerating hand model was checked by a root mean square (RMS) difference. The RMS difference by the pressure method was approximately half of the RMS difference by the "quasi-static" approach that has been a major method to predict fluid forces exerted by the hand in swimming. 
 The present study has quantified the effect of acceleration on fluid forces acting on the hand in swimming and developed a new pressure method including acceleration effects to predict fluid forces acting on the accelerating hand.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">swimming</field><field name="subject">hand</field><field name="subject">movements</field><field name="subject">mathematical models</field><field name="subject">acceleration</field><field name="subject">mechanics</field><field name="subject">fluid dynamics</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080121.120957</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Hierarchical capture-recapture models</field><field name="creator">Schofield, Matthew R</field><field name="description">A defining feature of capture-recapture is missing data due to imperfect detection of individuals. The standard approach used to deal with the missing data is to integrate (or sum) over all the possible unknown values. The missing data is completely removed and the resulting likelihood is in terms of the observed data. The problem with this approach is that often biologically unnatural parameters are chosen to make the integration (summation) tractable. A related consequence is that latent variables of interest, such as the population size and the number of births are only available as derived quantities. As they are not explicitly in the model they are not available to be used in the model as covariates to describe population dynamics. Therefore, models including density dependence are unable to be examined using standard methods. 
 Instead of explicitly integrating out missing data, we choose to include it using data augmentation. Instead of being removed, the missing data is now present in the likelihood as if it were actually observed. This means that we are able to specify models in terms of the data we would like to have observed, instead of the data we actually did observe. Having the complete data allows us to separate the processes of demographic interest from the sampling process. The separation means that we can focus on specifying the model for the demographic processes without worrying about the sampling model. Therefore, we no longer need to choose parameters in order to simplify the removal of missing data, but we are free to naturally write the model in terms of parameters that are of demographic interest. A consequence of this is that we are able write complex models in terms of a series of simpler conditional likelihood components. We show an example of this where we fit a CJS model that has an individual-specific time-varying covariate as well as live re-sightings and dead recoveries. 
 Data augmentation is naturally hierarchical, with parameters that are specified as random effects treated as any other latent variable and included into the likelihood. These hierarchical random effects models make it possible to explore stochastic relationships both (i) between parameters in the model, and (ii) between parameters and any covariates that are available. 
 Including all of the missing data means that latent variables of interest, including the population size and the number of births, can now be included and used in the model. We present an example where we use the population size (i) to allow us to parameterize birth in terms of the per-capita birth rates, and (ii) as a covariate for both the per-capita birth rate and the survival probabilities in a density dependent relationship.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">animal populations</field><field name="subject">statistical methods</field><field name="subject">mathematical models</field><field name="subject">animal marking</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080129.161029</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Catastrophic forgetting and the pseudorehearsal solution in Hopfield networks</field><field name="creator">McCallum, Simon</field><field name="description">Most artificial neural networks suffer from the problem of catastrophic forgetting, where previously learnt information is suddenly and completely lost when new information is learnt. Memory in real neural systems does not appear to suffer from this unusual behaviour. In this thesis we discuss the problem of catastrophic forgetting in Hopfield networks, and investigate various potential solutions. We extend the pseudorehearsal solution of Robins (1995) enabling it to work in this attractor network, and compare the results with the unlearning procedure proposed by Crick and Mitchison (1983). We then explore a familiarity measure based on the energy profile of the learnt patterns. By using the ratio of high energy to low energy parts of the network we can robustly distinguish the learnt patterns from the large number of spurious "fantasy" patterns that are common in these networks. This energy ratio measure is then used to improve the pseudorehearsal solution so that it can store 0.3N patterns in the Hopfield network, significantly more than previous proposed solutions to catastrophic forgetting. Finally, we explore links between the mechanisms investigated in this thesis and the consolidation of newly learnt material during sleep.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">neural networks (computer science)</field><field name="subject">distributed artificial intelligence</field><field name="subject">knowledge representation (information theory)</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080130.105101</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Translational control mechanisms used by the human Hepatitis B virus : an upstream open reading frame modulates expression of the pregenomic RNA</field><field name="creator">Chen, Augustine</field><field name="description">The human hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a small hepatotropic virus, which affects approximately 350 million chronic sufferers worldwide. It has a compact 3.2 kbp dsDNA genome encoding four major overlapping genes namely core, polymerase, surface and X required for its replication. The virus synthesises a pregenomic RNA (pgRNA) which functions both as an RNA intermediate for reverse transcription into the DNA genome and as the mRNA for the translation of the core (C) and polymerase (P) proteins. The core overlaps the polymerase gene and is translated at a 10 to 1 ratio. The polymerase gene translated from the P AUG codon is preceded by at least 4 upstream AUG codons (uAUGs), namely C AUG, C1 AUG, J AUG and C2 AUG. Various mechanisms have been implicated in the synthesis of the polymerase protein. This led to the currently accepted model which involves leaky scanning and a reinitiation mechanism in polymerase synthesis. 
 However, multiple sequence alignment of the pgRNA revealed a short upstream open reading frame (uORF) highly conserved at the nucleotide level in all HBV subtypes and mammalian hepadnaviruses. This previously unreported uORF, designated as C0 ORF in this study is also conserved in its position and length. Past studies have either omitted this uORF in their test constructs or ignored its potential role. The C0 ORF has a conserved weak initiation context and is located within the epsilon structure within the 5&#65533; leader of the pgRNA, required for viral encapsidation. Importantly, the C0 ORF precedes and overlaps the core ORF, which may suggest an alternative model in which the core and polymerase may be translated and coordinately regulated. 
 Fusion of the C0 ORF to luciferase showed for the first time that this uORF is translated through the detection of reporter activity (~20% of C) and also visualisation of the fusion protein via western analysis using anti-C0 and anti-luciferase antibodies. Subsequent removal of the C0 ORF implicated a role in repressing downstream core fusion protein synthesis in HepG2 cells. A similar repression was observed on J expression. 
 To study the effect of C0 on downstream polymerase translation, a pgRNA-like DNA construct was made and subsequent mutations introduced. Mutation of the C0 AUG led to an increase in initiation at the downstream P AUG. Alteration of the existing weak initiation context to an optimal context which favours stronger initiation consistently showed a potential role for C0 ORF in facilitating reinitiation at certain downstream initiation codons including P AUG. Mutations of other uAUGs preceding the P AUG were also done to better understand their roles in regulating polymerase synthesis. The removal of the C AUG markedly increased expression from the P AUG. This study revealed other internal uAUGs in-frame to the C AUG, namely the C1 and C2 AUGs are also effectively translated, further reducing availability of translating ribosomes to downstream P AUG. Indeed the removal of the C1 and C2 AUGs led to a corresponding increase in initiation from the P AUG. Initiation at the internal J AUG was also reported and its removal showed a significant decrease in expression from the P AUG, consistent with the previous model implicating reinitiation at the P initiation site after translation of the short J ORF. The inhibitory role of the 5 uAUGs prior to the P AUG were confirmed when all were removed, giving rise to translation almost equal to that at C AUG. 
 Taken together, these results suggest a new model in which the HBV C0 ORF plays a key role in controlling core and polymerase synthesis by repressing core translation and making available more ribosomes to downstream AUGs possibly facilitating translation reinitiation. In addition, the translation of the C0 ORF across the [epsilon] region may also preclude encapsidation, potentially acting as a switch discriminating the pgRNA template between encapsidation and translation. Therefore, the highly conserved [epsilon] region and C0 ORF present an excellent target for molecular based antiviral drugs (antisense oligonucleotides, aptamers, ribozymes) potentially providing new anti HBV drugs.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Hepatitis B virus</field><field name="subject">RNA</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080130.123043</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Spatial data from image sequences</field><field name="creator">Williams, Mark</field><field name="description">There are many existing methods for capturing three dimensional data from two dimensional images.

They have completely lost the capability for the aerial flight, but are highly efficient wing-propelled swimmers and divers. They have a long fossil record over 60 million years, and their origin could possibly extend back to the late Cretaceous. This study aims to elaborate the course of penguin evolution and driving force of changes based on fossil records of penguins. Numerous fossil penguin specimens have been collected and studied from New Zealand, Antarctica, South America, Australia, and Africa. Studies on fossil penguins have spanned about 150 years history since Huxley (1859). 
 Previous works on fossil penguins have achieved excellent results, but at the same time, left considerable confusion on taxonomy and anatomical interpretation, mainly because of the poor nature of the penguin fossils in early studies. Examination of newly found materials and updated evaluation of previously studied materials are needed, using modern methods. 
 During about 150 years of fossil penguins study since Huxley1859, more than 40 genera and 70 species have been described. The number of specimens listed in the published literature amounts to more than 1300. Chapter II reviews all those fossil penguins in a summarised and consistent style, aiming to present the taxonomy used in this study as a primary and essential resource for research. The chapter also provides other information on fossil penguins, such as geological data and an assessment of the skeletal association of the specimens referred to a species. 
 Chapter III introduces the osteology of penguins, by describing and comparing the skeletal characteristics and variation of both extant and fossil species. Though previous works on penguins osteology are extensive, the interpretation of the homology, and resulted terminology, are occasionally inappropriate, or incorrect, because of the highly-specialised structure. Many of the new, yet undescribed, fossils prompt a comprehensive update of those previous studies, to understand the nature of morphological variation in penguins, and to correct or clarify confusion in previous works. 
 The New Zealand fossil penguin fauna is one of the most significant for fossil penguin studies, but there are many undescribed fossil penguin specimens. Chapter IV provides accounts of such materials. Chapter IV also reviews previously-described New Zealand fossil penguins, usually re-evaluated using new materials. This chapter includes reassessment of the controversial, first-described fossil penguin Palaeeudyptes antarcticus, description of an enigmatic new species (Pakudyptes hakataramea gen. et sp. nov.) which could elucidate the evolutionary pattern of the penguin wing, description of new materials of Platydyptes revealing a unique structure and functional interpretation, and redescriptions with functional interpretation of Pachydyptes and Archaeospheniscus. 
 Published relationships within penguins have not been adequately discussed but stated within rather rough frameworks, so that the relationships within penguins were unclear. Chapter V provides an explicit framework for the phylogeny of penguins. Osteology-based cladistic analysis was performed to seek out the relationships within penguins, using observations on both extant and fossil penguins. There are several important grades in penguin history, which are structurally distant from each other. Results also agree with the published views in which the extant penguins form a rigid group, but Simpson&#65533;s subfamily groupings are only partly supported. A postulated phylogenetic tree includes all known fossil penguin taxa including un-named ones. 
 Chapter VI, as a synthesis of contents of previous chapters, provides a broad interpretation of penguin evolution through the Cenozoic: origin, body size increase, demise of 'giant penguins', and the emergence of modern penguins. The chapter gives a global picture of the interaction of penguins, pinnipeds, cetaceans, and temperature and sea-level change. Two main sections are: 'Origin of penguins' and 'Evolutionary process of penguins.' The loss of aerial flight and increase of body size were possibly triggered by the K/T mass extinction event which drastically reduced the predatory pressure for early penguins. The 'giant penguins' survived until the Late Oligocene but declined as the oceans modernised, and new forms of whales with advanced feeding function appeared. There is controversy about appearance of modern penguins. The fossil-based hypothesis (relatively recent origin for crown-penguins) contradicts the molecular-based one (ancient origin for crown penguins), though 'hard evidence' at present does not easily refute either hypothesis.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">penguins</field><field name="subject">fossils</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080204.140701</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Removal or modification of smear layer : effect on the Prepometer instrument</field><field name="creator">Violich, Darryl Ray</field><field name="description">Aim: To determine the effect of removing or modifying smear layer from dentine on the Prepometer dentine thickness indicator device, which operates using electrical conductivity (Hager &amp; Werken, Germany). 
 Method: Twelve third molars were prepared by reducing the crowns to a flat dentine surface. Five reference points were marked and control Prepometer readings taken using its coloured LED display. Six teeth (Group E) were treated with 18% EDTA and six (Group T) with Tubulicid (Dental Therapeutics AB, Sweden). Readings were repeated. Dentine was removed in 0.5 mm increments, readings repeated and reductions continued for each tooth until the instrument gave a reading of 10 (red), indicating the pulp was close. Teeth were sectioned and the distance from the references to the pulp was measured. Readings at each level were compared using the t-test, Wilcoxon Signed Ranks test (WSR) and Ordinal Regression (OR). SEM was used to illustrate the effects of materials on the dentine. 
 Results: For Group E (N = 160 pairs) t-test showed a significant (P = 0.026) difference between control and treatment scores. WSR also showed significance: E&gt;control in 54 ranks, E&lt; control in 33 and E = control in 73 (P =0.007). For group T (N = 155) t-test showed a highly significant (P = 0.005) difference. WSR showed T&lt; control in 59 ranks, T&gt; control in 37 and T = control in 59 (P =0.008). 
 OR showed that a red light was obtained further from the pulp with EDTA treatment than with Tubulicid. SEM showed total smear layer removal in Group E and occlusion of tubule openings in Group T. 
 Conclusion: Measurements of dentinal conductivity were significantly influenced by treatment with EDTA and Tubulicid. Conductivity increased after EDTA but decreased after treatment with Tubulicid, possibly owing to blocking of tubules.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">dentin</field><field name="subject">measurement</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080207.155907</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Genetic contributors to congenital joint dislocation</field><field name="creator">Bicknell, Louise Susan</field><field name="description">Understanding the molecular basis of Mendelian disorders featuring joint dislocation can enhance the knowledge of genetic or cellular pathways required in joint development, and provide candidate genes for studying related complex disorders, such as developmental dysplasia of the hip. Two strategies were employed in this project to investigate Mendelian contributors to congenital joint dislocation. 
 The first strategy was to investigate in-depth a gene known to be associated with joint dislocation. Missense mutations or small in-frame deletions in FLNB, encoding filamin B, have previously been associated with a spectrum of osteochondrodysplasias. Screening a larger cohort established FLNB as the sole underlying disease gene for atelosteogenesis type I and III and also boomerang dysplasia, which was previously thought clinically to be allelic to AOI. Mutations in FLNB cause a large proportion of Larsen syndrome cases with phenotypes reminiscent of the early case series reported. Atypical or "recessive" Larsen syndrome may therefore be due to a different underlying genetic aberration. The disease-associated amino acid substitutions or in-frame deletion/insertions cluster to two main regions of the filamin B protein: the calponin homology 2 domain of the actin-binding domain, and repeats 13-17 of the rod domain. To analyse the functions of these regions, yeast two-hybrid analyses were performed. No interactors were identified with the calponin homology 2 domain, which suggests the amino acid substitutions may disrupt actin binding or the regulation thereof. A candidate interactor, centromere protein J, was identified that binds to repeats 13-15, and could suggest a model for aberrant cell division seen in growth plates of bones of individuals with atelosteogenesis types I and III and boomerang dysplasia. 
 The second strategy used in this project was to investigate the genetic cause of a novel syndrome featuring joint dislocation. A neurocutaneous phenotype segregated in a consanguineous New Zealand family, and through a genetic mapping strategy, a significantly linked locus was identified at 10q23 (Z = 3.63), in which segregation of a common ancestral haplotype fits the linkage hypothesis of homozygosity by descent. Candidate gene analysis and subsequent screening identified a missense mutation 2350C&gt;T in ALDH18A1, which predicts the substitution H784Y in the encoded protein [Delta]&#65533;-pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthase (P5CS). The known function of P5CS in proline and ornithine biosynthesis was not affected by the presence of H784Y in an indirect assay, and therefore the hypothesis proposed was that a novel, unknown moonlighting function of P5CS is perturbed causing the phenotype segregating in the family. As an initial exploration of functions of P5CS in the cell, yeast two-hybrid analysis was undertaken. 
 This project examined the contribution of two genes, FLNB and ALDH18A1, to Mendelian congenital joint dislocations. How the cellular functions of the encoded proteins in the cytoskeleton, metabolism, or signal transduction, are critical for joint development is ill understood. Future investigations aimed at identifying candidate genes that confer susceptibility to developmental dysplasia of the hip should consider candidate genes that encode proteins related in function to the products of the FLNB and ALDH18A1 genes.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">dislocations</field><field name="subject">genetic aspects</field><field name="subject">hip joint</field><field name="subject">congenital dislocation</field><field name="subject">human abnormalities</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080211.151359</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Induction and decay of heat acclimation</field><field name="creator">Garrett, Andrew</field><field name="description">Most advice for improving physiological strain in the heat includes maintaining hydration using long-term acclimation protocols (&gt;10 days). Therefore, the major aims of this thesis were to examine; (i) effectiveness of short term (5-day) heat acclimation (STHA) with moderately and highly trained athletes; (ii) fluid regulatory strain has a thermally-independent role in heat adaptation; and, (iii) impact of STHA on a marker of thermotolerance&#768; (inducible heat shock protein 70; HSP70). 
 Ten moderately trained males completed heat acclimation (Acc) under controlled hyperthermia (rectal temperature 38.5&#65533;C) for 90-min on five consecutive days (T[a] = 40&#65533;C, 60% RH), on two occasions separated by a five-week washout, in a cross-over design. One Acc was undertaken with euhydration (fluid replenishment; EUH) and one with dehydration (no fluid intake; DEH) during daily Acc bouts. Participants completed an exercising heat stress test (HST) one week before, then on the 2nd day after Acc for both regimes. HST involved cycling at 40% PPO for 90 min (T[a] = 35&#65533;C, 60% RH), 10 min rest and a ramp protocol (2% PPO each 30 s) to volitional fatigue. HSTs were further completed 1, 2, and 3 wks after Acc to track the acclimation decay. On a later occasion eight highly trained male rowers were heat acclimated under the same protocol but with DEH acclimation only and a rowing-specific HST (2000 m rowing performance test). Plasma volume (PV) at rest and cardiac output (Q&#775;) during HSTs were measured using CO and CO&#8322; rebreathing, respectively. A number of plasma constituents were measured: PV, AVP, aldosterone, HSP70, total protein, albumin, Na&#8314;, K&#8314;, Cl&#8315; and osmolality. 
 Short term heat acclimation resulted in physiological adaptation and enhanced exercise capacity for moderately trained participants. Compared to EUH permissive DEH during Acc bouts conferred larger acclimation-induced increases in resting PV by 4.1% (95%CI: -1.5 to 9.8%; p=0.06), Q&#775;[F]. (4.2: 0.7 to 7.8 mlmin&#8315;&#65533; 100 ml&#8315;&#65533;; p0.009), FVC (0.06: 0.02 to 0.10 ml 100ml Tissue&#8315;&#65533;mmHg&#8315;&#65533;; p=0.006), end-exercise V[s] (45.9: 3.6 to 84.4 mL; p=0.02) and decreased end-exercise f[c] by 17% (19: -29 to 9 b&#65533;min&#8315;&#65533;; p=0.08). Cardiovascular adaptations except PV persisted for one wk, but not two wks after Acc indicating that cardiovascular-related benefits from STHA may not be mediated by hypervolaemic responses per se. The highly trained athletes had functional heat adaptations of similar magnitude to lesser fitness-adapted participants across DEH acclimation, including resting PV expansion (4.5: 0.7 to 8.3%) and increased performance (-4.0: -6.3 to 0.6[s]; p=0.02). Plasma total protein-corrected HSP70 concentration increased from rest to end-exercise across acclimation (p=0.001). There was a greater change from rest to end-exercise on day one versus day five Acc (p=0.05), indicating a reduced stress-induced increase and a protective adaptive change. There were weak to moderate relationships between hydration indices in dynamic circumstances indicating that there is no single measure to accurately assess hydration status. 
 In conclusion, short-term (5-day) heat acclimation was effective with adaptations more pronounced after fluid regulatory strain from a dehydration acclimation regime. Similar findings were found using highly trained and lesser- fitness adapted participants. Thermotolerance was increased by dehydration acclimation.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">heat adaptation</field><field name="subject">acclimatization</field><field name="subject">athletes</field><field name="subject">physiology</field><field name="subject">sports</field><field name="subject">physiological aspects</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20071019.140025</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Stories of Moses and visual narration in Jewish and early Christian art (3rd century AD)</field><field name="creator">Tatham, Gail Constance</field><field name="description">This thesis considers the evolution of narrative art in Judaism and early Christianity, and deals in particular with narrative figure scenes in which Moses is the principal figure. Current theories, espoused by the late Kurt Weitzmann, posit the existence of a Jewish illustrated manuscript tradition dating back to the Hellenistic period, which could have been the source for Old Testament scenes in art. In the light of these proposals and taking into account more recent narrative theory, this study of early Moses scenes in art takes up the suggestion that a large range of visual narrative scenes, closely following a given text and with a tendency for these scenes to be arranged in narrative sequence, might indicate the presence of a lost illustrated manuscript which artists are using as their model. 
 Stories about Moses originate from within Judaism, and are mentioned also in Christian texts for the first three centuries AD, when Moses is regarded as the forerunner of Christ. While earlier Jewish art largely conformed to the proscription against figural art, narrative figure scenes illustrating Old Testament stories are known from the late second century AD. In the synagogue at Dura Europos (AD c.250), the range of biblical imagery includes five or six scenes illustrating stories from Exodus and Numbers, although Weitzmann&#65533;s criteria are only partially fulfilled. 
 During the third century AD, when the earliest Christian art is found, Christians use Old Testament imagery as well, including a cycle of scenes illustrating the story of Jonah. The decoration in the baptistery in the Christian house at Dura, like that in the synagogue there, shows some interest in visual narrative, although in this case no Moses scenes are involved. At this time there is only one Moses story certainly illustrated in Christian art, The miracle of the spring (based on Exodus 17), which occurs in funerary art in Rome. The iconography for this scene is used "emblematically" to promote ideas rather than stories about Moses. If at this time Christian artists know of a narrative cycle involving Moses, they show very little interest in reflecting this.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Moses (Biblical leader)</field><field name="subject">Jewish art</field><field name="subject">early Christian art</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080318.163116</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Chemical investigations of mitochondria</field><field name="creator">Adlam, Victoria Jean</field><field name="description">The production of reactive oxygen species by mitochondria results in mitochondrial dysfunction through oxidative stress. Because mitochondria play such a crucial role in cell function through the production of energy and the regulation of apoptosis this mitochondrial damage can lead to cellular dysfunction and ultimately to the pathophysiology of many diseases. 
 A series of mitochondria-targeted derivatives of vitamin E (MitoE) have been synthesised. The synthesis begins from readily available starting materials and can be systematically varied to create a MitoE analogue of desired lipophilicity. The syntheses of MitoE&#8322;, MitoE&#8324;, MitoE&#8326;, MitoE&#8321;&#8320; and MitoE&#8321;&#8321; have been completed and are reported herein. MitoE&#8322; and MitoE&#8321;&#8320; have been assessed for antioxidant efficacy and they are significantly more potent than untargeted vitamin E analogues. 
 Modification of the phenolic functionality of vitamin E causes significant perturbation to its biological activity. Substitution at this position with a succinoyl ester results in potent pro-apoptotic activity and selective toxicity to malignant cells. A mitochondria-targeted analogue of vitamin E succinate (MitoE succinate) has been synthesised by reaction of MitoE&#8321;&#8321; with succinic anhydride. This compound is a particularly potent inducer of apoptosis in malignant cells and is non-toxic to non-malignant cells. 
 MitoQ&#8321;&#8320; is well established as a potent mitochondria-targeted antioxidant in vitro, however in vivo results are limited. In this study MitoQ&#8321;&#8320; was examined in an ex vivo cardiac model of ischemia-reperfusion injury. It was found to be significantly more effective than untargeted antioxidants at reducing cardiac and mitochondrial dysfunction, as well as tissue damage induced by ischemia and reperfusion. 
 Because mitochondria play a key role in a wide range of pathologies, imaging mitochondrial function in vivo would have great diagnostic value. A series of fluorine containing phosphonium salts have been synthesised these compounds have potential applications in &#65533;&#8313;F MRI imaging.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">mitochondria</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080404.144622</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The synthesis and characterisation of phosphatidylinositol mannans</field><field name="creator">Dyer, Blake S</field><field name="description">Mycobacterial cell wall components have been shown to elicit a range of immunological responses in mammalian hosts. A family of cell wall antigens, the phosphatidylinositol mannans (PIMs), have been shown to reduce allergic response in a murine model of allergic airway disease and have been suggested as potential therapeutic agents. Isolation and characterisation of these compounds is not facile. To confirm the structure of PIMs a number of phosphatidylinositols (PIs), 1a-c, PIM1s 2a, 2d and 2e, and AcPIM1s, 2g and 2f, were prepared to allow assignment of the acylation pattern of natural products and for evaluation in immunological assays. As the natural products include 19:0 acylation in the form of (R)-tuberculostearoyl residues, a source of (R)-tuberculostearic acid was needed. To this end, an efficient synthesis of (R)-tuberculostearic acid from (S)-citronellol, utilising a copper-catalysed cross-coupling reaction and a modified Julia olefination, was developed. This material was incorporated into diacylglycerols prepared from (R)-benzyl glycidol. 
 A protected myo-inositol derivative, 188, and two protected pseudo-disaccharides, 10 and 241, were prepared from myo-inositol via desymmetrisation utilising a camphylidene acetal. These were coupled with diacylglycerols via a phosphate ester and deprotected to give PIs, PIM1s and AcPIM1s. 
 Mass spectrometry studies were undertaken on the PIs, 1a-c, PIM1s 2a, 2d and 2e, and AcPIM1s, 2g and 2f which structures that have been established by chemical synthesis. Comparison of these data with those reported for natural PIs and PIMs containing 19:0 ((R)-tuberculostearoyl) and 16:0 (palmitoyl) acyl groups unequivocally established that the 19:0 residue was located at the sn-1 and the 16:0 at the sn-2 position of the glycerol moiety in nature.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">bacterial cell walls</field><field name="subject">mycobacteria</field><field name="subject">phosphoinositides</field><field name="subject">synthesis</field><field name="subject">phosphatidylinositols</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080415.142001</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The construction of a disaster destination : rebuilding Koh Phi Phi, Thailand</field><field name="creator">Leopold, Teresa Ingeborg</field><field name="description">The popular tourist destination island of Koh Phi Phi Don, Thailand was heavily affected by the Indian Ocean Tsunami in December 2004, which resulted in a destroyed tourism infrastructure and complete downturn of tourism. Extensive recovery and rebuilding work by emerging community groups, returned locals, international volunteers and Thai government units provided an efficient but hasty reconstruction of the destination. Ethnographic research conducted in the community provided insights into the complex stakeholder interactions and their roles and influences on the reconstruction of the community. 
 The community&#65533;s level of vulnerability on Koh Phi Phi Don was influenced by social processes and interactions during the destination&#65533;s recovery process as the various stakeholders (e.g. government vs. locals) had differing perceptions of the island&#65533;s economic, environmental and social vulnerability. These disputes are grounded in different social time processes, particularly illustrated through land law disputes among locals, landowners and the government. Other factors which influenced the reconstruction of Koh Phi Phi as a tourist destination were pre-tsunami conditions (past overdevelopment), the empowerment of the community, the reconstructed place identity, various anniversary celebrations and the early warning system. 
 A model is suggested to illustrate and discuss Koh Phi Phi Don as a disaster destination, which provides insights into the dynamics which govern a destination&#65533;s post-disaster recovery period. Thus, it illustrates how stakeholder interaction is influenced by distinct understandings of the multiple notions of vulnerability. Furthermore, this study establishes essential links between disaster and tourism theories and suggests an extended tourism disaster management framework, which calls for an inclusion of post-recovery processes.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">tourism</field><field name="subject">Thailand</field><field name="subject">Koh Phi Phi</field><field name="subject">disasters</field><field name="subject">Indian Ocean Tsunami 2004</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080430.100246</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dissolved organic matter in New Zealand natural waters</field><field name="creator">Gonsior, Michael</field><field name="description">Dissolved organic matter (DOM) is the most dynamic and least understood part of the global oceanic carbon cycle. Furthermore the molecular composition of DOM is largely unknown. This study focused on the distribution pattern, removal processes and molecular characterisation of DOM in a range of estuaries and coastal zones in New Zealand. Doubtful Sound, the longest fjord in Fiordland National Park, South Island, New Zealand was of particular interest, because of the combination of extreme rainfall, enhanced production of DOM within the temperate rainforest which largely appears in the relatively deep ([greater than or equal to] 5 m) low salinity layer (LSL) at the fjord surface. A typical river estuary (Freshwater River) located in Stewart Island, New Zealand was also investigated. Optical water properties such as the UV/Vis absorption coefficient at 355 nm (a[CDOM](355)) and excitation-emission matrix fluorescence (EEM) were determined for samples from freshwater, across the LSL into open ocean water. These optical properties showed a marked decrease with salinity and highest levels of EEM fluorescence and a[CDOM] (355) in the brackish surface water. In addition to the observed changes in the optical properties, ultrahigh resolution Electrospray Ionisation Fourier Transform Ion Cyclotron Resonance Mass Spectrometry (ESI-FT-ICR-MS) determination of molecular formulae revealed that in the fjord about 20 % of these formulae changed along a vertical salinity gradient across the LSL between the brackish surface water and the saline water at 5 m depth. This trend was even more pronounced along the salinity gradient of the Fresh Water River Estuary in Stewart Island, where 60 % of all assigned molecular masses changed from freshwater over the mixing zone to ocean water. Associated with these changes was a marked increase in aromaticity with increasing salinity. Comparable behaviour with increasing salinity was also observed in estuarine samples from the Cape Fear River system, North Carolina, USA. 
 In contrast, only minor changes were determined in molecular formulae for surface water samples collected along a transect off the Otago Coast and across the Subtropical Convergence (STC) into Subantarctic Water (SAW). However, a comparison of the molecular formulae assigned to the DOM pool for the STC water and a freshwater stream in Doubtful Sound, revealed that 75 % of all the assigned formulae for the open ocean sample were common to these two markedly different types of natural waters. This seemingly refractory DOM contained nearly 600 assigned molecular formulae, which were all very similar (only spaced by two hydrogen and CH&#8322; groups) and could be explained with only 9 general molecular formulae. However, the comparison of all assigned formulae for the freshwater sample suggested that about 90 % of the assigned molecular formulae for the terrestrially-derived DOM changed as it moved from rivers to the open ocean and that only 10 % remained the same. 
 Singlet oxygen showed a very close relationship with the optical properties such as the absorption coefficients (a[CDOM](355)) and the EEM fluorescence intensities and these results suggested that singlet oxygen steady state concentrations are linked to CDOM. 
 Photodegradation processes were confirmed to be responsible for a significant destruction of CDOM. Samples collected from different salinity waters showed major differences in wavelength-dependent photo-decay of CDOM suggesting that the rate of photodegradation in the UV range decreased with increase in salinity whereas it was enhanced for longer wavelength radiation ([greater than or equal to]400 nm). Additionally, the predominantly unsaturated compounds produced during estuarine mixing were found to be highly photolabile and were either destroyed or new unsaturated compounds were produced within 21 h of solar irradiation.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">water</field><field name="subject">organic compound content</field><field name="subject">water quality</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080501.114023</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies of cobalt(III) complexes containing tripodal tetraamine ligands</field><field name="creator">McClintock, Lisa F</field><field name="description">The new Co(III) carbonate complexes [Co(uns-penp)(O&#8322;CO)]ClO&#8324;&#65533;H&#8322;O and [Co(trpyn)(O&#8322;CO)]ClO&#8324;, containing tripodal tetraamine ligands, have been synthesised and characterised by microanalysis, &#65533;H, &#65533;&#65533;C and &#8309;&#8313;Co NMR, mass spectrometry (MS) and UV-vis spectroscopy. In addition, the &#8309;&#8313;Co NMR spectra have been obtained for two series of [Co(N&#8324;)(O&#8322;CO)]&#8314; complexes containing aliphatic (N&#8324; = tren, baep, abap, trpn) and pyridyl (N&#8324; = tpa, pmea, pmap, tepa) tripodal tetraamine ligands and the complex [Co(dppa)(O&#8322;CO)]&#8314;. The &#8309;&#8313;Co NMR signal increases as [Delta] decreases, indicating there is less electron density at the Co(III) nucleus as the metal-ligand orbital overlap becomes poorer. A linear relationship was found to exist between the [Delta] for the individual complexes and their &#8309;&#8313;Co NMR chemical shifts which follows the relationship: [Delta] = 29 174 + -0.89363 x [delta](&#8309;&#8313;Co) 
 For the two series of [Co(N&#8324;)(O&#8322;CO)]+ complexes, plots of the magnetogyric ratio (&#947;) and [lambda][max] have y-intercepts that do not accurately correspond to the magnetogyric ratio of the bare cobalt nucleus (&#947;&#8320;(Co)). This is due to the deviation of the complexes from pure octahedral symmetry. A fluxional process in the complex [Co(pmea)(O&#8322;CO)]&#8314; was investigated using variable temperate (VT) NMR. This was found to involve the inversion of a six-membered chelate ring about a pseudo mirror plane with a [Delta]G[double dagger] of 58 kJ mol&#8315;&#65533; at 25 &#65533;C. Mass spectra have been obtained for all the [Co(N&#8324;)(O&#8322;CO)]&#8314; complexes, and these show a common fragmentation pattern for all the complexes except [Co(trpn)(O&#8322;CO)]&#8314;, where CO&#8322; is lost from the molecular ion to give a [Co(N&#8324;)O]&#8314; adduct.

The product of acid hydrolysis of [Co(pmea)(O&#8322;CO)]&#8314; has been indentified by X-ray crystallography as [Co(pmea)(OH&#8322;)&#8322;]&#65533;&#8314; (triclinic, P-1, a = 9.7065(5) A&#778;, b = 15.5645(8) A&#778;, c = 11.5740(5) A&#778;, &#945; = 84.660(1)&#65533;, &#946; = 123.255(1)&#65533;, &#947; = 104.283(1)&#65533;, Z = 2, R1 = 0.0402, wR2 = 0.1009).

The first and second processes were thought to be [H&#8323;O&#8314;] dependent, while the third was fit to a first order exponential decay and was [H&#8323;O&#8314;] independent (k[obs] ~ 4.2 x 10&#8315;&#65533; s&#8315;&#65533; for [Co(baep)(O&#8322;CO)]&#8314;, 3.8 x 10&#8315;&#65533; s&#8315;&#65533; for [Co(abap)(O&#8322;CO)]&#8314; and 3.5 x 10&#8315;&#65533; s&#8315;&#65533; for [Co(trpn)(O&#8322;CO)]&#8314;). However, none of the processes could be confidently assigned to a step in the acid hydrolysis mechanism. The data obtained from the studies of [Co(tpa)(O&#8322;CO)]&#8314; and [Co(Me&#8323;-tpa)(O&#8322;CO)]&#8314; showed a single first order [H&#8323;O&#8314;] dependent process which was fit to the following expression: k[obs] = (k&#8321;K[H&#8323;O]&#8314;)/(1 + K[H&#8323;O]&#8314; 
 This gave k&#8321; = 5.8 x 10&#8315;&#8308; &#65533; 2.3 x 10&#8315;&#8308; s&#8315;&#65533; and K = 0.13 &#65533; 0.06 L mol&#8315;&#65533; for [Co(tpa)(O&#8322;CO)]&#8314; at 25 &#65533;C and k&#8321; = 6.0 x 10&#8315;&#8309; &#65533; 2.0 x 10&#8315;&#8310; s&#8315;&#65533; and K = 0.38 &#65533; 0.02 L mol&#8315;&#65533; for [Co(Me&#8323;-tpa)(O&#8322;CO)]&#8314; at 50 &#65533;C. Both values of K indicate that protonation of chelated carbonate is far from complete at [H&#8323;O&#8314;] = 1.0 mol L&#8315;&#65533;. Comparative rates of acid hydrolysis at [H&#8323;O&#8314;] = 6.0 mol L&#8315;&#65533; were obtained for the complexes [Co(tpa)(O&#8322;CO)]&#8314; (k[obs] = 1.79 x 10&#8315;&#65533; s&#8315;&#65533;, 25 &#65533;C), [Co(pmea)(O&#8322;CO)]&#8314; (k[obs] = 1.8 x 10&#8315;&#8309; s&#8315;&#65533;, 25 &#65533;C), [Co(pmap)(O&#8322;CO)]&#8314; (k[obs] = 2.5 x 10&#8315;&#8309; s&#8315;&#65533;, 50 &#65533;C), [Co(tepa)(O&#8322;CO)]&#8314; (k[obs] = 4.3 x 10&#8315;&#8309; s&#8315;&#65533;, 25 &#65533;C) and [Co(trpyn)(O&#8322;CO)]&#8314; (k[obs] = 1.3 x 10&#8315;&#8308; s&#8315;&#65533;, 50 &#65533;C) and at [H&#8323;O&#8314;] = 1.0 mol L&#8315;&#65533; for the complexes [Co(uns-penp)(O&#8322;CO)]&#8314; (k[obs] = 2.9 x 10&#8315;&#65533; s&#8315;&#65533;, 25 &#65533;C) and [Co(dppa)(O&#8322;CO)]&#8314; (k[obs] = 2.7 x 10&#8315;&#8308; s&#8315;&#65533;, 25 &#65533;C). The vast differences in the rates of acid hydrolysis can be rationalised on a steric basis. Bulkier ancillary ligands impede the direct protonation of an endo oxygen atom, or the transfer of a proton from the exo to an endo oxygen atom. 
 The chelated bicarbonate complex [Co(trpyn)(O&#8322;COH)]ZnCl&#8324;&#65533;3H&#8322;O has been synthesised and characterised by microanalysis and X-ray crystallography (orthorhombic, Pbca, a = 18.1820(66) A&#778;, b = 14.7256(44) A&#778;, c = 19.6344(68) A&#778;, &#945; = &#946; = &#947; = 90&#65533;, Z = 8, R1 = 0.0435, wR2 = 0.1130).

In addition, the X-ray crystal structures of the complexes [Co(trpyn)(O&#8322;CO)](Zn(OH)&#8322;Cl&#8323;)&#65533;4H&#8322;O (triclinic, P-1, a = 7.4962(7) A&#778;, b = 13.4019(11) A&#778;, c = 13.6887(11) A&#778;, &#945; = 74.631(4)&#65533;, &#946; = 82.893(4)&#65533;, &#947; = 82.324(4)&#65533;, Z = 2, R1 = 0.0268, wR2 = 0.0638) and [Co(tepa)(O&#8322;CO)]&#8322;(ZnCl&#8324;)&#65533;3H&#8322;O (triclinic, P-1, a = 9.9250(10) A&#778;, b = 15.5561(13) A&#778;, c = 15.8730(16) A&#778;, &#945; = 89.545(4)&#65533;, &#946; = 85.019(5)&#65533;, &#947; = 72.714(4)&#65533;, Z = 2, R1 = 0.0291, wR2 = 0.0722) were obtained. These two complexes were synthesised under analogous conditions to the bi- and trimetallic complexes. However, in these cases metallation of chelated carbonate did not occur. 
 DFT calculations have been used to calculate the relative energies of pairs of geometric isomers of [Co(N&#8324;)(O&#8322;CO)]&#8314; complexes (N&#8324; = baep, abap, pmea, pmap, dppa, Me-tpa, Me&#8322;-tpa). In all cases, except that of [Co(Me-tpa)(O&#8322;CO)]&#8314;, the calculations correctly predict that the experimentally observed isomer is lower in energy. An electronic study on two series of [Co(N&#8324;)(O&#8322;CO)]&#8314; complexes containing pyridyl (N&#8324; = tpa, pmea, pmap, tepa) and Me-pyridyl (N&#8324; = tpa, Me-tpa, Me&#8322;-tpa, Me&#8323;-tpa) tripodal tetraamine ligands correctly reproduces the observed trends in &#8309;&#8313;Co NMR chemical shift and [Delta] values. A molecular orbital analysis of the two series of complexes shows that there is no significant difference between the highest energy occupied orbitals with the largest contribution from the coordinated oxygen atoms. Bond decomposition analyses of the two series of complexes indicate that there is also no difference in total bond energies. These results indicate that there is no electronic explanation for the large differences in reactivity towards acid that is observed experimentally. 
 The first mononuclear complex containing chelated hydrogen phosphate, [Co(pmea)(O&#8322;PO&#8322;H)]ClO&#8324;, has been synthesised and characterised using microanalysis, &#65533;H, &#65533;&#65533;C, &#65533;&#65533;P and &#8309;&#8313;Co NMR, UV-vis spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography (monoclinic, P2&#8321;/c, a = 8.7017(17) A&#778;, b = 27.639(5) A&#778;, c = 9.586(2) A&#778;, &#946; = 112.818(9)&#65533;, &#945; = &#947; = 90&#65533;, Z = 4, R1 = 0.0443, wR2 = 0.1076). The X-ray crystal structure of [Co(pmeaH)(OH&#8322;)Cl&#8322;](CoCl&#8324;)&#65533;H&#8322;O (orthorhombic, P2&#8321;2&#8321;2&#8321;, a = 12.6354(3) A&#778;, b = 12.6354(3) A&#778;, c = 15.8261(11) A&#778;, &#945; = &#946; = &#947; = 90&#65533;, Z = 4, R1 = 0.0397, wR2 = 0.0954), in which the pmea ligand is coordinated in a hypodentate fashion, was also obtained. [Co(pmeaH)(OH&#8322;)Cl&#8322;](CoCl&#8324;)&#65533;H&#8322;O is thought to be an impurity in crude samples of [Co(pmea)Cl&#8322;]Cl. The pK[a] of [Co(pmea)(O&#8322;PO&#8322;H)]&#8314; was determined to be 4.99 &#65533; 0.02 by potentiometric titration. A ring inversion fluxional process, analogous to that observed for [Co(pmea)(O&#8322;CO)]&#8314;, was found by VT-NMR to have a [Delta]G[double dagger] of 60 kJ mol&#8315;&#65533; at 35 &#65533;C. A &#65533;&#65533;P NMR spectrum, taken after the solution was left standing for approximately three hours, showed evidence of cleavage of the hydrogen phosphate chelate via a bimetallic hydrolysis mechanism. Attempts were also made to synthesise Co(III) complexes containing chelated phosphate ester ligands (monomethyl phosphate and monophenyl phosphate), with pmea as the ancillary ligand. &#65533;&#65533;P NMR spectra of the crude samples indicate that the monomethyl phosphate moiety is chelated to Co(III) (&#65533;&#65533;P [delta] = 21.05 ppm). However, it is unclear whether the monophenyl phosphate is chelated or bridging between two Co(III) ions (&#65533;&#65533;P [delta] = 14.36 ppm).</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cobalt</field><field name="subject">synthesis</field><field name="subject">ligands</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080505.142115</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Blessed is he who keeps the words of prophecy in this book : an intra-textual reading of the apocalypse as parenesis</field><field name="creator">Frank, Patrik Immanuel</field><field name="description">This thesis seeks to explore the implications of a parenetic reading of the Book of Revelation as a whole, rather than merely of the seven messages in which this is more commonly regarded as the primary purpose of the text. It examines the validity of this approach in relation to the book&#65533;s claims about its purpose in the original communication event of which its text is a witness and its effectiveness in addressing hermeneutical issues in key passages of the book and argues that attention to the function of parenesis facilitates readings of Revelation which connect more directly with the intention of the book free from the need to decipher obscure coded references to past or future history. 
 Drawing from the text of the Apocalypse a twofold hermeneutical strategy is developed and exemplified by application to key passages of the book. The first aspect of this reading strategy is focussed on the proposed parenetic nature of the book. In an examination of Revelation&#65533;s introductory and concluding passages it is argued that as a coherent unity they form a frame around the book. This frame serves to establish the perspective from which the whole book may be read. It does so by giving rise to the expectation that the whole book contains parenetic exhortation to faithfulness in light of the imminent parousia. Consequently this thesis proceeds to interpret the Book of Revelation by focussing primarily on how the various images in the book&#65533;s body (4:1-22:9) as well as the explicit parenesis in the seven messages serve to communicate this parenetic exhortation to the original addressees. 
 The second aspect of interpretation seeks to facilitate scholarly analysis of the parenesis expected to be contained in Revelation&#65533;s body with systematic regard for the individual situation of each of the addressees of the book, as documented in the comparatively accessible seven messages. To this end an intra-textual hermeneutic is employed. It builds on an examination of the links between the various parts of Revelation which is part of the examination of both the book&#65533;s frame and the seven messages. This intra-textual reading utilizes the many links between the seven messages and Revelation&#65533;s body by allowing them to play a determinative role in the investigation of an image&#65533;s parenetic implications. 
 In order to further explore the validity of a parentic reading, the intra-textual principle is applied to two central parts of Revelation&#65533;s body, the Babylon vision (Rev 17-19:3) and the seal, trumpet and bowl visions (Rev 6, 8, 9, 11:15-19, 15, 16). 
 In this reading, the Babylon vision is read not as a general critique of the church&#65533;s pagan environment but as a divine commentary on the concrete threats and temptations with which the churches of the seven messages were confronted. In God&#65533;s judgment of Babylon those who suffer under her violence against Christians are promised vindication and are thus encouraged to maintain their faithful witness as citizens of the New Jerusalem. The citizens of Babylon however are exhorted to repent and leave her behind, becoming citizens of the New Jerusalem and thus escaping Babylon&#65533;s demise. 
 The seal, trumpet and bowl visions are interpreted as illustrating the dividing line between what constitutes faithful witness to Christ on the one hand and heed to satanic deception on the other. Faithfulness even to the point of death is expected of the followers of the Lamb; the inhabitants of the earth are exhorted to repent from their affiliation with the beast and give glory to God. 
 Thus such an intra-textual reading of Revelation as parenesis offers a strategy for reading the book in a way that is relevant for the Christian church beyond the limits of end-time phantasms on the one hand and mere historic interest on the other hand and so might facilitate the emergence of the message of the book from the obscurity in which it appears to be hidden to a significant proportion of its contemporary readers.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bible</field><field name="subject">New Testament</field><field name="subject">Revelation</field><field name="subject">Babylon (Extinct city)</field><field name="subject">Jerusalem</field><field name="subject">visions</field><field name="subject">witness bearing (Christianity)</field><field name="subject">eschatology</field><field name="subject">biblical teaching</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080506.163527</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Space matters : modeling selection in spatially heterogeneous environments</field><field name="creator">Star, Bastiaan</field><field name="description">Selection in spatially heterogeneous environments is a convenient explanation for the high levels of genetic variation observed in natural populations. Indeed, theoretical studies predict that spatial heterogeneity leads to higher levels of variation in a variety of selection models. These models, however, have assumed quite restrictive parameters (e.g., two alleles, fixed gene flow and specific selection schemes). Therefore, the effect on spatial heterogeneity is still poorly understood for a wider range of parameters (e.g., multiple alleles, different levels of gene flow and more general selection schemes). We have relaxed some of the assumptions that have limited the previous models and studied the effect of spatial heterogeneity using simple single-locus viability selection models. 
 First, we investigate the rarity of the parts of fitness space maintaining variation for multiple alleles and different levels of gene flow by randomly sampling that space using a "fitness space" approach. The volume of fitness space maintaining variation is always larger in a spatial model compared to a single-population model regardless of gene flow. Moreover, this volume is relatively larger for higher numbers of alleles, indicating that spatial heterogeneity is more efficient maintaining higher levels of variation. 
 Second, we investigate the ease with which a more natural process of recurrent mutation and selection evolves to the particular area of fitness space maintaining variation using a "construction" approach. Depending on the amount of gene flow, the construction approach leads to both higher and lower levels of variation compared to a single-population model. Thus, spatial heterogeneity can both constrain and promote the ease with which a natural process of mutation and selection evolves to maintain variation. Also, the construction approach results in variation being maintained in a more stable subset of the volume of fitness space than the volume that resulted from the fitness space approach. 
 Third, we investigate the effect of higher and lower levels of spatial environmental heterogeneity using the construction approach. The different levels of heterogeneity and gene flow interact to influence the amount of variation that is eventually maintained and this interaction effect is especially strong for intermediate levels of gene flow. More heterogeneous environments can maintain higher levels of variation, but selection in these environments also results in a higher level of migration load, lowering the final amount of adaptation that is achieved by the simulated evolutionary process. 
 Finally, we investigate effect of genetic drift and finite populations using the construction approach. Interestingly, two different effects emerge for smaller and larger populations; in smaller populations genetic drift lowers the amount of variation as expected, whereas, more surprisingly, genetic drift increases the amount of variation in larger populations. 
 Overall, spatial heterogeneity has profound effects on the outcome of selection, resulting in elevated levels of genetic variation for a wide variety of parameters.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">natural selection</field><field name="subject">variation (biology)</field><field name="subject">population genetics</field><field name="subject">evolutionary genetics</field><field name="subject">ecological heterogeneity</field><field name="subject">ecological genetics</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080507.151534</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Supranational governance of tourism : aid, trade and power relations between the European Union and the South Pacific island states</field><field name="creator">Schilcher, Daniela</field><field name="description">This thesis examined the role of supranational organisations (SOs) in the governance of tourism in a North-South context. Focusing on the issue area of development cooperation, this thesis investigated the question of how and why SOs got involved in tourism in developing countries, and more specifically, in small island developing states. Such involvement may occur either directly through aid funded projects or indirectly through international trade regimes that impact on tourism in the aid recipient countries. The thesis adopted a case study approach focussing on the European Union&#65533;s (EU&#65533;s) involvement in the governance of tourism in South Pacific island states. Grounded in a history of colonialism, the EU has been involved in the &#65533;development&#65533; of the South Pacific for more than three decades, which allowed to track changes in development philosophy over time. Focusing on the concept of power, the case was assessed in a multi-scalar manner, analysing the EU&#65533;s involvement from the global down to the local level. Never before has an entire multilevel polity been assessed in one coherent case study, incorporating actors situated at all levels and ranging from supranational organisations to national governments, businesses, communities, and individuals. 
 The methods employed in this thesis included interviews, participant observation, document analysis (policy documents and newspapers), and subsequently critical discourse analysis. The latter served to highlight the so-called &#65533;third face of power&#65533; (Lukes 1974), which is closely related to the concept of ideological hegemony. Interviews were conducted in Fiji and Samoa with officials of the South Pacific Delegations of the EU, officials of tourism authorities, NGOs, tourism operators and community members. Elite interviews in Brussels were conducted with officials of the European Commission and the European Parliament. 
 Under all scales and &#65533;faces&#65533; of power the EU was found to be the dominant actor, while the issue of self-interest appeared to play a key role. At a macro-level, the EU clearly dominated in most overt decision-making situations during negotiations on aid and trade agreements. As concerned the inclusion of tourism in the agreements, the relative importance of the sector was clearly dependent on the European Commission&#65533;s prevailing attitude on &#65533;tourism and development&#65533; at any point in time. At a meso- and micro-level, the EU&#65533;s influence was less obvious yet nonetheless existent, for example through funding rules and the use of European consultants. Indirect influence also occurred at the national level. In particular the substitution of a preferential trade regime with a free trade agreement (the Economic Partnership Agreements), which is currently being negotiated between the EU and the Pacific Islands, is likely to have a significant impact on the economic importance of tourism, as well as public policy in the South Pacific. In a mini case study of Samoa, it was found that the resulting changes in tourism policy would have a significant impact &#65533;on the ground&#65533;, in particular with regard to rates of local ownership and control. 
 Overall, power relations were found to be highly unequal and self-determination and empowerment have largely not been achieved. However, more research is needed to examine the ability to generalise the findings to other geographic regions or other types of SOs. The key contribution of this thesis in the theoretical realm constitutes its bridging of agency and structure within multi-level governance, which may be conceived as a &#65533;third way&#65533; to either dependency theory-influenced studies (global/structure) or community approaches (local/agency).</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">tourism</field><field name="subject">Pacific area</field><field name="subject">developing countries</field><field name="subject">political aspects</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080508.150955</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Food-based strategies to improve dietary iron intake and biochemical iron status in 12-24 month old New Zealand children</field><field name="creator">Szymlek-Gay, Ewa Anna</field><field name="description">Adequate nutrition is fundamental to optimal physical and cognitive growth in the second year of life. Toddlers, however, are particularly vulnerable to poor nutrition due to their high nutrient needs in relation to their body size and energy intakes. Nutrient-dense diets are therefore essential during this period. However, no practical quantitative food-based dietary guidelines directed at this age group are available to help caregivers choose nutrient-rich foods for their toddler. Such guidelines are needed not only to ensure adequate intakes of all nutrients during the period of dietary transition from infant to family foods, but also to emphasise intakes of nutrients for which toddlers are at particular risk of deficiency. Biochemical evidence suggests that iron nutrition requires special attention in New Zealand toddlers. The overall aim of this thesis was to design and assess the efficacy of practical food-based strategies for toddlers to ensure optimal nutritional status of 12-24 month old New Zealand children, with a specific focus on iron nutrition. To achieve these overall aims, the research was carried out in three stages. 
 In the first stage, secondary data analysis of food intake data for New Zealand toddlers identified the foods commonly consumed by New Zealand toddlers, the serving sizes and frequency of consumption of these foods, and the nutrients that New Zealand toddlers are at risk of consuming in suboptimal amounts. The food intake data were obtained from 3-day weighed food intakes that had been collected on non-consecutive days in an earlier community-based cross-sectional survey of 188 randomly selected non-breastfeeding 12-24 month old urban South Island New Zealand children. In addition to describing the food consumption patterns of New Zealand toddlers, the secondary data analysis also identified that nearly 40% of New Zealand toddlers were at risk of suboptimal iron intakes. 
 The results of these analyses were used in the second stage of the thesis to develop three food-based strategies. To do this a 4-phase approach based on linear and goal programming was used to design and hypothetically evaluate three sets of food-based strategies for 12-24 month old non-breastfeeding New Zealand children, and to identify the key problem nutrients for each set of strategies. The three sets of strategies were based on: (1) all foods consumed by toddlers including iron-fortified infant and toddler foods, (2) family foods only, or (3) family foods that are not fortified with iron. The mathematical modelling confirmed that iron was the key problem nutrient in the diets of New Zealand toddlers. The analysis showed that only food-based strategies that included a recommendation for the replacement of non-fortified cow&#65533;s milk with an iron-fortified toddler milk (500 mL), i.e. strategy set 1, achieved the Australian-New Zealand Recommended Dietary Intakes for all nutrients, including iron. In fact, inclusion of a recommendation for a substantially increased consumption of flesh foods was identified as the only possible alternative to the iron-fortified toddler milk recommendation for improving iron nutrition in New Zealand toddlers. Although the set of strategies including this flesh food recommendation did not provide as much total iron as those including the iron-fortified toddler milk recommendation, the bioavailability of the iron is likely to be greater because flesh foods provide highly bioavailable haem iron (red meat being a particularly rich source) and have an enhancing effect on the absorption of non-haem iron. The two key recommendations for achieving New Zealand toddlers&#65533; iron needs were, therefore, a recommendation to consume an iron-fortified toddler milk and a recommendation to consume substantial amounts of red meat. 
 In the third stage, the efficacy of an increased intake of red meat or the use of an iron-fortified milk for improving biochemical iron status in healthy non-anaemic 12-20 month old New Zealand children was investigated in a 20-week partial double-blind randomised placebo-controlled intervention trial. The study also examined the effect of these two interventions on dietary iron intakes and growth, and investigated the association between the amount of meat consumed and biochemical iron parameters. Participants (n=225) were assigned to one of three groups: Meat Group (n=90), Fortified Milk Group (n=45), or Placebo Group (n=90). Children in the Meat Group were encouraged to consume two red meat dishes per day (~ 2.6 mg of iron). In the Fortified Milk Group and Placebo Group, the children&#65533;s regular milk was replaced with iron-fortified cow&#65533;s milk (1.5 mg of iron per 100 g of prepared milk), or non-fortified cow&#65533;s milk (&lt; 0.1 mg of iron per 100 g of prepared milk), respectively. Geometric mean dietary iron intakes (95% CI) increased from 4.7 (4.1, 5.3) to 5.3 (4.7, 6.0) mg per day in the Meat Group (P=0.007), and from 4.3 (3.7, 5.0) to 10.4 (9.0, 12.2) mg per day in the Fortified Milk Group (P&lt;0.001). These increased iron intakes differed significantly from the Placebo Group (both P&lt;0.001), which declined from 5.1 (4.5, 5.7) to 4.6 (4.1, 5.2) mg per day during the intervention (P=0.047). Over 20 weeks, adjusted geometric mean serum ferritin concentration increased by 44% (95% CI: 14%, 82%) in the Fortified Milk Group (P=0.002), tended to decrease in the Placebo Group (14% decrease (95% CI: -27%, 1%; P=0.063)), and did not significantly change in the Meat Group (10% increase (95% CI: -7%, 30%; P=0.241)). However, because iron status declined in the Placebo Group, both groups fared significantly better than the Placebo Group: serum ferritin concentration at 20 weeks was 68% (95% CI: 27%, 124%; P&lt;0.001) greater in the Fortified Milk Group than in the Placebo Group, and 29% (95% CI: 2%, 63%; P=0.033) greater in the Meat Group than in the Placebo Group. There were no intervention effects on haemoglobin or serum transferrin receptor concentration. The cross-sectional analysis showed that a daily intake of 1 g of red meat was associated with 0.65% (95% CI: 0.18%, 1.11%; P=0.007) higher serum ferritin concentration. No adverse effects of the interventions on the toddlers&#65533; growth were detected. 
 In conclusion, this thesis shows that food-based strategies can be designed that, if adhered to, should ensure adequate iron status in New Zealand toddlers. Although both the iron-fortified milk recommendation and the increased red meat recommendation are likely to prevent the decline in body iron stores that can occur during the second year of life, only consumption of iron-fortified milk can successfully increase iron stores. Therefore, food-based strategies for New Zealand toddlers will need to include a recommendation that encourages the consumption of foods developed specifically for toddlers that are fortified with iron.</field><field name="date">n/a</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">children</field><field name="subject">infants</field><field name="subject">nutrition</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">iron in the body</field><field name="subject">iron deficiency diseases in children</field><field name="subject">prevention</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080509.141258</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Interaction between delta epithelial sodium channel ([delta]ENaC) and COMMD1</field><field name="creator">Chang, Chi-Chun</field><field name="description">The epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) is a key regulator of salt homeostasis. The classic ENaC consists of three subunits: &#945;, &#946; and &#947;, which are highly expressed in the kidney and colon where they mediate electrogenic Na&#8314; influx into cells under the tight hormonal regulation of aldosterone. 
 A fourth ENaC subunit named [delta]ENaC also generates Na&#8314; influx with the &#946;- and &#947;ENaC subunits in Xenopus oocytes. However [delta]ENaC differs to the other subunits in its channel properties and tissue distribution, suggesting that [delta]ENaC may possess a physiological role other than salt regulation. A copper-toxicosis related protein called COMMD1/Murr1 was previously identified to directly interact with [delta]ENaC and downregulate [delta]ENaC activity. COMMD1 is linked with multiple ubiquitination pathways, therefore we hypothesised that COMMD1 directly interacts with [delta]ENaC through novel protein-protein interaction motifs and promotes internalisation of [delta]ENaC from the cell surface through enhanced ubiquitination. 
 With the use of GST pulldown assays and coimmunoprecipitation, it was found that the binding of COMMD1 to [delta]ENaC is mediated by the COMM domain of COMMD1, primarily through amino acids 120-150 of COMMD1. Immunocytochemical studies showed that the intracellular interaction between [delta]ENaC and COMMD1 predominantly occurred in the early and recycling endosomes, suggesting that COMMD1 may promote the retrieval of [delta]ENaC from the cell surface to the intracellular pool. COMMD1 mediated a decrease in the [delta]ENaC cell surface population, as shown by a biotinylation surface labelling assay. This may be driven by an ubiquitin-regulated endocytosis, as COMMD1 increased ubiquitination, but not proteasomal/lysosomal degradation, of [delta]ENaC. COMMD1 may promote [delta]ENaC ubiquitination through the action of the ubiquitin ligase Nedd4-2 as coexpression with Nedd4-2 enhanced the COMMD1-mediated decrease in surface [delta]ENaC expression. This is abolished by the addition of the Nedd4-2 downregulator kinase sgk1, suggesting that COMMD1 may downregulate [delta]ENaC through the Nedd4-2/sgk1 pathway. Surface levels of [delta]ENaC may also be affected by XIAP, a RING domain ubiquitin ligase which is able to decrease the levels of COMMD1. Coimmunoprecipitation of endogenous [delta]ENaC and COMMD1 proteins, and the enhanced colocalisation of endogenous [delta]ENaC in the recycling endosomes with transfected COMMD1, indicate that interaction between transfected [delta]ENaC and COMMD1 reflect the intracellular interactions of the endogenous proteins. 
 Taken together, these findings suggest that COMMD1 downregulates [delta]ENaC activity by promoting the internalisation of surface [delta]ENaC into early and recycling endosomes and this may be mediated by enhanced [delta]ENaC ubiquitination via the ubiquitin ligase Nedd4-2.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">sodium channels</field><field name="subject">copper proteins</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080512.123318</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterisation of apoB peptide inhibitors of lipoprotein(a) assembly</field><field name="creator">Wang, Yan-Ting</field><field name="description">High plasma levels of lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] are an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Currently, no drugs have proven successful at lowering Lp(a) levels. Lp(a) is comprised of a LDL particle which is covalently bound to an additional glycoprotein, apolipoprotein(a) [apo(a)]. One approach is to develop inhibitors of Lp(a) assembly. It is therefore worth investigating inhibitors for the interaction between apo(a) and apoB-100 for their therapeutic potential to reduce plasma Lp(a) levels. A synthetic &#945;-helical peptide, apoB&#8324;&#8323;&#8327;&#8322;&#8331;&#8329;&#8322; peptide, has been shown to be an effective inhibitor of Lp(a) assembly in vitro (IC&#8325;&#8320;= 40 [mu]M). Complexing of the apoB&#8324;&#8323;&#8327;&#8322;&#8331;&#8329;&#8322; peptide with dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC) in 1:45 molar ratio increased its inhibitory activity to 4 [mu]M. Since the peptide:DMPC molar ratio previously used in vitro could not be obtained for in vivo study, lower molar ratios of the apoB&#8324;&#8323;&#8327;&#8322;&#8331;&#8329;&#8322; peptide-DMPC complex were assessed for their inhibitory activities on Lp(a) assembly in vitro and the Lp(a) lowering effect in vivo. A version of the apoB peptide modified to increase stability with DMPC under physiological conditions was also assessed. The aim of this project was to investigate the Lp(a) lowering effect of this peptide-DMPC complex in vivo and to determine its possible mechanism of action. 
 Studies showed that a 1:20 ratio of the apoB&#8324;&#8323;&#8327;&#8322;&#8331;&#8329;&#8322; peptide-DMPC complex exhibited an effective inhibition of Lp(a) assembly in vitro (IC&#8325;&#8320;= 9 [mu]M). Intravenous injection of this peptide-DMPC complex (1.3 &#65533; 0.2 mg peptide/mouse) significantly decreased Lp(a) levels at 1, 2 and 4 hours after injection compared with DMPC (p&lt; 0.01). However, a lethal effect occurred in some animals after treatment. This effect is likely associated with the aggregation of the apoB&#8324;&#8323;&#8327;&#8322;&#8331;&#8329;&#8322; peptide-DMPC complex under physiological conditions. 
 In order to develop a more stable peptide, a synthetic peptide, apoB[4365-4396K] based on the apoB4365-4396 sequence and substituted with extra lysines was analyzed and shown to be &#945;-helical in the absence and presence of DMPC. Intrinsic fluorescence studies showed that the apoB[4365-96K] peptide interacted with DMPC under physiological conditions. Also, the apoB[4365-96K] peptide-DMPC complex was shown to form small stable particles by dynamic light scattering. The apoB[4365-96K] peptide proved to be an effective inhibitor of Lp(a) assembly in vitro (IC&#8325;&#8320;= 38 [mu]M). Complexing the apoB[4365-96K] peptide to DMPC increased its inhibitory activity to 16 [mu]M. 
 Intravenous injection of the apoB[4365-96K] peptide-DMPC complex decreased the Lp(a) levels at 1 hour and 2 hours after injection compared to DMPC (p&lt; 0.05). The apoB[4365-96K] peptide was present in circulation prominently at 1 hour after intravenous injection and this coincided with a decrease in Lp(a) levels. Neither the apoB[4365-96K] peptide-DMPC complex nor DMPC had a significant effect on Lp(a) levels after intraperitoneal injection. 
 The mechanism by which the apoB[4365-96K] peptide-DMPC complex lowers Lp(a) levels was further investigated. The apoB[4365-96K] peptide was found to associate with plasma lipoproteins through ultrafiltration and agarose gel shift assays. The association of the peptide with lipoproteins was dependent on &#945;-helical structure and enhanced by complexing with DMPC. The association of the apoB[4365-96K] peptide with lipoproteins was also observed in plasma samples from mice treated with the apoB[436S-96K] peptide-DMPC complex intravenously. The association of the peptide-DMPC complex with plasma lipoproteins was most prominent at 1 hour after injection and this coincided with a maximum decrease in Lp(a) levels. These results suggest that the lipoprotein association of the apoB[4365-96K] peptide-DMPC complex played a role in lowering Lp(a) levels in vivo. 
 The work presented in this thesis has shown that apoB peptides containing apoB4372-4392 sequence have inhibitory effect on Lp(a) assembly in vitro and lower Lp(a) levels in vivo. The &#945;-helical structure of the peptide is important for its lipid binding ability and its inhibitory activity on Lp(a) assembly. Furthermore, the association of peptide with lipoproteins appears to play a role in its ability to inhibit Lp(a) assembly in vitro and lower Lp(a) levels in vivo. The studies undertaken in this thesis suggest that altering lipoprotein charges and conformation may reduce the efficiency of Lp(a) assembly. The knowledge gained in this study may provide a basis for future design of inhibitors of Lp(a) assembly.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">peptides</field><field name="subject">inhibitors</field><field name="subject">Lipoprotein A</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080513.112352</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Assessing the willingness to pay in the context of communal land values : the case of backpackers in Fiji</field><field name="creator">Tokalau, Filipo</field><field name="description">Communal land values can, on the one hand, be an integral part of the socio-cultural experience which tourists seek and enjoy while visiting Fiji. Partly inherited from the land, such values are still vital as basis of survival in rural Fiji. They are passive so they do not command a price and therefore largely considered free however, indigenous Fijian landowners tend to perceive that such values are an inseparable part of their land and may often expect that these ought to be paid for when land is taken up for development such as in tourism. This dilemma within the tourism system could underpin land conflicts between traditional landowners and tourism entrepreneurs. As tourists ultimately bear costs, the problem can be partially addressed by focusing on their willingness to pay for communal use of land. 
 This research assesses the backpackers&#65533; willingness to pay (WTP) for communal values of land in Fiji, including their opinions, feelings, attitudes and perceptions. It uses a social, psychological-economic theoretical framework which postulates firstly, that backpackers will pay in order to maximise satisfaction and, that utilities from passive values can be derived and measured. Secondly, as backpackers search for authenticity, adventure and meeting local people they would tend to be self actualised and therefore willing to pay. A contingent valuation study was undertaken in Fiji from February to June 2003 with a relatively high participation and response rate. Semi-structured interviews were conducted from February to March, 2005 to elicit backpackers&#65533; knowledge, feelings, perceptions and attitudes regarding their willingness to pay for the communal use of land. 
 A great majority of respondents were willing to pay. CV respondents were willing to pay an average of F$6.50 for the communal value of land but the younger, highly educated and long haulers would pay less. Though a high proportion of respondents were willing to pay because they valued the communal use of land, for the majority the main reason was financial. Interviewees were willing to pay for economic, psychological and egocentric reasons. The latter two were particularly based on their motivational satisfaction and understanding of the traditional land-based survival skills. Respondents&#65533; perceptions of communal values of land, incomes and psychological attitude were also major factors underlying why they were not willing to pay. 
 In light of the study&#65533;s findings, it was suggested that the backpacker concept may need to be re-examined as they tended not to be necessarily as budget-minded and exploitative as generally depicted to be. Similarly, they tended to be self-actualising and also espousing motivations similar to those of mass tourists. It was also proposed that WTP can provide a basis for economically analysing the use of passive values of environmental tourism resources, such as land, which can facilitate the industry&#65533;s ability in decision making, and management. As an incentive, WTP for communal values of land can be crucial in enhancing and sustaining tourism in a land-scarce economy such as Fiji. In the interim, WTP for communal land use could also provide informed decisions to address current issues such as the Customary Fisheries Bill. Indeed, this pioneering study examines the very issues of passive values for traditionally owned resources which can be applied more broadly; not only in Fiji, but also in other parts of the Pacific.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">backpacking</field><field name="subject">commons</field><field name="subject">tourism</field><field name="subject">Fiji</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080513.121054</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Risk factors for venous thromboembolism</field><field name="creator">Parkin, Lianne</field><field name="description">Background: Many risk factors for venous thromboembolism have been identified, but two particular exposures - the use of combined oral contraceptives and long-distance air travel - have generated considerable concern in recent years. In contrast, a possible link between venous thromboembolism and a third exposure - the use of psychotropic drugs - was first raised in the 1950s, but has received surprisingly little attention. Information about all three exposures and the risk of fatal events is limited. These risks were examined in three inter-related national population-based studies. 
 Methods: The underlying study population included all men and women aged 15 - 59 years who died in New Zealand between 1990 and 2000, for whom the underlying cause of death was pulmonary embolism. 
 The potential associations between fatal pulmonary embolism and the use of oral contraceptives and psychotropic drugs were explored in a general practice records-based case-control study. Non-users were the reference category for all analyses. Contraceptive supply data were used to estimate the absolute risk of death from pulmonary embolism in users of oral contraceptives. 
 A second case-control study, in which computer-assisted telephone interviews were undertaken with the next of kin of cases who had been resident in New Zealand, and with sex and age-matched controls randomly selected from the electoral roll, investigated the possible association between long-distance air travel and fatal pulmonary embolism. 
 Finally, the absolute risk of dying from pulmonary embolism following a long-distance flight was estimated in a descriptive study based on official migration data and deaths in recent air travellers. 
 Results: The adjusted odds ratio for use of any oral contraceptive in the three months before the index date (the onset of the fatal episode) was 13.1 (95% CI 4.4 - 39.0). The odds ratio for formulations containing desogestrel and gestodene was about three times higher than the point estimate for levonorgestrel products; preparations containing cyproterone acetate appeared to carry the highest risk. The estimated absolute risk of fatal pulmonary embolism in current users of oral contraceptives was 10.5 (95% CI 6.2 - 16.6) per million woman-years. 
 The adjusted odds ratio for current use of any antipsychotic was 13.3 (95% CI 2.3 - 76.3). Low-potency antipsychotics carried a 20-fold increase in risk; thioridazine was the main drug involved. Antidepressant use was also associated with a significantly increased risk (adjusted odds ratio 4.9 [95% CI 1.1 - 22.5]). 
 Compared with non-travellers, people who had undertaken a flight of more than eight hours&#65533; duration in the preceding four weeks were eight times more likely to die from pulmonary embolism (odds ratio 7.9 [95% CI 1.1 - 55.1]). The absolute risk of fatal pulmonary embolism following air travel of more than eight hours was 1.3 (95% CI 0.4 - 3.0) per million arrivals. 
 Conclusions: The present research was the first to have estimated the relative risks of fatal pulmonary embolism in relation to three exposures: oral contraceptive use in a population in which preparations containing desogestrel and gestodene preparations were widely used, conventional antipsychotics, and long-distance air travel. The findings were consistent with previous, and subsequent, studies of non-fatal events. Increased risks of fatal pulmonary embolism in users of antidepressants, and in people with an intellectual disability, have not been described previously and warrant further investigation. Referral and diagnostic biases are very unlikely in these studies of fatal events, and other types of bias and possible confounding are considered unlikely explanations for the findings.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">thromboembolism</field><field name="subject">thrombophlebitis</field><field name="subject">risk factors</field><field name="subject">veins</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080513.145314</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Globalization and the state : towards a neo-medieval political order?</field><field name="creator">Haigh, Stephen Paul</field><field name="description">The system of states that now covers the planet did not arise out of thin air; rather it was the product of historical forces that gradually coalesced around the state form. But the dynamics of that process no longer obtain. In their place, a new, highly complex amalgam of material and ideational forces is now in the ascendant -- and its arrival has serious implications for traditionally configured, "Westphalian" states. 
 Understood as ("thick") globalization, this interlocking array of political, economic, social and cultural forces challenges the old order at two key points. First, traditional states had "hard shells," by means of which they were capable of consolidating differences between &#65533;inside&#65533; and &#65533;outside&#65533; to the point where the latter could more easily be quarantined. Second, for closely related reasons they were largely able to "absorb" domestic society, such that the individual was less a citizen than (s)he was a subject. But these (dubious) capabilities have been severely exposed and eroded, which leads us to ask, "Whither the state under globalization?" My thesis constitutes a sustained attempt to answer this question. 
 The theme is a large one - and I believe that to be adequately treated, large themes require a varied approach. First, in terms of theory this means that I borrow from a significant diversity of recognized &#65533;Schools&#65533; within the discipline of International Relations. Second, in terms of method I follow a similarly pluralist line. Broadly speaking, the work is interpretive as opposed to explanatory, which is to concede that one cannot be &#65533;purely&#65533; scientific while standing inside the phenomena one wishes to examine. On the other hand, this forecloses neither the scientific method nor its guiding spirit. With respect to states and the international system, we can still be "scientific realists:" states are real structures whose nature can legitimately be approximated through sciences. In sum, I cleave to a sort of methodological middle ground between science and interpretation, taking from each in the measure that they advance the discussion. Third, in terms of normative intent my chief concern is with the way things are; but as it turns out, the way things are increasingly includes the way they ought to be. In other words, the ontology of our globalizing world is increasingly deontological in texture. 
 This may sound contradictory. Nevertheless, the spread of universal norms - and of equally universal ordering principles, or patterns of global organization - has undeniable repercussions for the relationship between is and ought. In turn, the implications for states are profound. The answer to my central question, "Wither the state under globalization?" is this: we are now on the threshold of a neo-medieval era of segmented political authority. Centrally nested within this new order is the embedded cosmopolitan state, wherein universal and particular aspects of being can now be fully reconciled.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">globalization</field><field name="subject">medievalism</field><field name="subject">political aspects</field><field name="subject">nation-state</field><field name="subject">international relations</field><field name="subject">internationalism</field><field name="subject">international organisation</field><field name="subject">sovereignty</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080514.111752</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Microcrystalline Silicon Thin Films Prepared by Hot-Wire Chemical Vapour Deposition</field><field name="creator">E.Mohamed@murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">Silicon is widely used in optoelectronic devices, including solar cells. In recent years new forms of silicon have become available, including amorphous, microcrystalline and nano-crystalline material. These new forms have great promise for low cost, thin film solar cells and the purpose of this work is to investigate their preparation and properties with a view to their future use in solar cells.

A Hot Wire-Deposition Chemical Vapour Deposition CVD (HW-CVD) system was constructed to create a multi-chamber high vacuum system in combination with an existing Plasma Enhanced Chemical Vapour Deposition (PECVD) system; to study the amorphous to crystalline transition in silicon thin films. As the two chambers were linked by a common airlock, it was essential to construct a transfer mechanism to allow the transfer of the sample holder between the two systems. This was accomplished by the incorporation of two gate valves between the two chambers and the common airlock as well as a rail system and a magnetic drive that were designed to support the weight of, and to guide the sample holder through the system. 

The effect of different deposition conditions on the properties and structure of the material deposited in the combined HW-CVD:PECVD system were investigated. The conditions needed to obtain a range of materials, including amorphous, nano- and microcrystalline silicon films were determined and then successfully replicated. 

The structure of each material was analysed using Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). The presence of crystallites in the material was confirmed and the structure of the material detected by TEM was compared to the results obtained by Raman spectroscopy. The Raman spectrum of each sample was decoupled into three components representing the amorphous, intermediate and crystalline phases. The Raman analysis revealed that the amorphous silicon thin film had a dominant amorphous phase with smaller contribution from the intermediate and crystalline phase. This result supported the findings of the TEM studies which showed some medium range order. Analysis of the Raman spectrum for samples deposited at increasing filament temperatures showed that the degree of order within the samples increased, with the evolution of the crystalline phase and decline of the amorphous phase. The Selected Area Diffraction (SAD) patterns obtained from the TEM were analysed to gain qualitative information regarding the change in crystallite size. These findings have been confirmed by the TEM micrograph measurements.

The deposition regime where the transition from amorphous to microcrystalline silicon took place was examined by varying the deposition parameters of filament temperature, total pressure in the chamber, gas flow rate, deposition time and substrate temperature. 

The IR absorption spectrum for &#131;&#221;c-Si showed the typical peaks at 2100cm-1 and 626cm-1, of the stretching and wagging modes, respectively. The increase in the crystallinity of the thin films was consistent with the evolution of the 2100cm-1 band in IR, and the decreasing hydrogen content, as well as the shift of the wagging mode to lower wavenumber. IR spectroscopy has proven to be a sensitive technique for detecting the crystalline phase in the deposited material.

Several devices were also constructed by depositing the &#131;&#221;c-Si thin films as the intrinsic layer in a solar cell, to obtain information on their characteristics. The p- layer (amorphous silicon) was deposited in the PECVD chamber, and the sample was then transferred under vacuum using the transport system to the HW-CVD chamber where the i-layer (microcrystalline silicon) was deposited. The sample holder was transferred back to the PECVD chamber where the n-layer (amorphous silicon) was deposited. 

The research presented in this thesis represents a preliminary investigation of the properties of &#131;&#221;c-Si thin films. Once the properties and optimum deposition characteristics for thin films are established, this research can form the basis for the optimization of a solar cell consisting of the most efficient combination of amorphous, nano- and microcrystalline materials.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">solar cells</field><field name="subject">hotwire - cvd</field><field name="subject">high vacuum</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20050421.133523</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ageing in Australia: Financial Independence and Work Disincentive Issues</field><field name="creator">r.ong@murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates issues central to population ageing in Australia. A principal policy concern is financing the retirement incomes of an increasing number of aged retirees from a shrinking working age population. The investigation has two primary aims. The first is to measure the budgetary savings that alternative social security reforms may yield, and the implications of these reforms for the economic wellbeing of the elderly. The second is to examine how the aged can become more self sufficient through an exploration of the potential role of home equity conversion, an understanding of why the labour force participation of mature age Australians is low, and how labour force participation may be promoted as retirement approaches.   

A microsimulation model is employed to conduct empirical analyses in the context of the new tax system introduced in July 2000. The main microsimulation exercises include measurement of the impacts of potential social security reforms and home equity conversion on the economic well-being of the elderly, and estimation of work disincentive measures, that is, effective marginal tax rates and replacement rates. The Replacement rate estimates are then used in econometric models of labour force participation. Innovative approaches are developed to overcome methodological problems that have prevented the inclusion of replacement rates in previous models.

The major findings are that reforms motivated by budgetary savings can have sizeable adverse impacts on the economic well-being of the elderly. Home equity conversion can promote financial independence, but significant risks are borne by elderly homeowners in those states and regions with less buoyant house prices. Blunt work incentives are experienced by specific mature age socio-economic groups, in particular persons whose partners&#146; incomes help to cushion their economic position on quitting employment. The replacement rate is found to have a significant impact on the participation decision of mature age persons.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ageing</field><field name="subject">work disincentives</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20050526.150529</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Zinc Application and its Availability to Plants</field><field name="creator">30075885@student.murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">Globally, low zinc (Zn) soils are widespread, but one of the largest expanses of such soils is in south west Australia (WA).  Early Zn research in the region determined how much fertiliser Zn was required for profitable production of spring wheat (Triticium aestivum L.) and subterranean clover (Trifolium subterraneanum L), the major crop and pasture species at the time.  The research showed that Zn sulfate and ZnO were equally effective Zn fertilisers, but ZnO was cheaper and so was widely used.  The research indicated that in the year of application, depending on soil type, between 0.5-1.5 kg Zn/ha provided adequate Zn for the production of wheat and subterranean clover.  The length of time that a single application of Zn fertiliser remains fully effective in maintaining the production of crops and pasture in future years (residual value; (RV)) had not been determined.  This knowledge of the RV of Zn fertilisers is required for soils of WA.  The experiments that measured the RV of fertiliser Zn for spring wheat and subterranean clover form the bulk of this thesis.

The soils in the region were also initially acutely phosphorus (P) deficient requiring the application of fertiliser P for profitable production.  Single superphosphate was the P fertiliser initially used.  It was manufactured locally using phosphate rock imported from Nauru and Christmas Islands.  This phosphate rock also contained much Zn, and the single superphosphate manufactured from it contained 400-600 mg Zn/kg.  At amounts of application needed to provide adequate P, the Zn-contaminated superphosphate also supplied about 90 g Zn/ha.  Therefore, early field experiments measured the RV of ZnO applied to soil when single superphosphate was applied annually at &gt;150 kg/ha.  In these experiments, the RV of Zn was measured when different amounts of fertiliser nitrogen (N) was applied.  This was because it has recently been very profitable to apply fertiliser N to wheat crops, which greatly increased grain yields and so may have increased the demand for Zn, thereby probably decreasing the RV of the original ZnO application.  In these experiments, there were many nil-Zn plots.  In subsequent years, freshly-applied ZnO amounts were applied to measure the RV of the original ZnO treatments relative to the fresh Zn treatment.  No Zn deficiency was detected for up to 23 years after applying ZnO while applying superphosphate at &gt;150 kg/ha per year and for all amounts of N applied.

Subsequently cheap imported DAP fertiliser was used for wheat crops instead of locally produced Zn-contaminated single superphosphate and urea. The imported DAP contained about 50 mg Zn/kg (1/12 that of single superphosphate).  This new fertiliser strategy induced Zn deficiency in many wheat crops.  This led to further field studies to determine the RV of ZnO fertiliser when DAP was applied.  The experiments also included 2 Zn-contaminated single superphosphate treatments.  In one, no ZnO was applied, and superphosphate was applied at &gt;150 kg/ha per year to match the amount of P applied as DAP to the other treatments.  The other treatment was the same, except 1.5 kg/ha Zn as ZnO was applied in the first year only. In subsequent years, freshly-applied ZnO amounts were applied to measure the RV of the original ZnO treatments relative to the fresh Zn treatment.  Relative to freshly-applied Zn in each year, the RV of the original ZnO treatments decreased as the length of time that the Zn was in contact with soil increased.  However, the rate of decline in the RV was also found to differ with soil type, and was affected by soil pH, clay and organic carbon content of soil, and in alkaline soils with the calcium carbonate content of soil. 

Parallel glasshouse studies measured the RV of Zn, as Zn sulfate, for wheat and subterranean clover, using many soils from WA and other Australian States.  The glasshouse studies also showed that the rate of decline in the RV of the original Zn application varied markedly with soil type and was strongly influenced by soil pH, clay and organic carbon content of soil, and in the alkaline soils, the amount of calcium carbonate in soil.

In the above studies, the RV of fertiliser Zn was measured relative to freshly-applied Zn using yield of plants (shoots and grain for wheat, shoots for clover), Zn content in shoots and grain, and soil test Zn using the ammonium oxalate and DTPA procedures.  In addition, Zn concentration in young tissue and rest of shoots (glasshouse studies) and young tissue and whole shoots (field studies) was measured, and Zn concentration related to 90 % of the maximum yield (critical Zn in plant parts) was determined.  The studies showed that the DTPA soil test procedure, together with soil pH, and clay and organic matter content of soil, was an accurate prognostic test for indicating when Zn deficiency was likely in the next clover or wheat crop.  The study confirmed that young tissue (youngest fully expanded leaves) provided critical plant test values for diagnosing Zn deficiency in plants.  The plant and soil tests for Zn are now used by commercial soil and tissue testing laboratories.

When Zn deficiency was diagnosed early in field grown wheat, Zn sprays can be applied to the crop foliage to prevent or minimise decreases in grain yields at the end of the growing season.  Zn sulfate and Zn chelate are the most widely used compounds.  This thesis reports the results of a field study to compare the effectiveness of the two compounds when the spray was applied at two growth stages of wheat (Gs14; seedling growth and Gs24; tillering).  In addition, Zn applied with the seed while sowing the wheat crop was also included.  Zinc applied to the soil while sowing was the most effective treatment.  Zn chelate was more effective as a spray than Zn sulfate when applied at the earlier growth stage, but Zn sulfate was cheaper, and both sprays were equally effective when applied at the later growth stage.

Recently in the region, durum wheat (T. durum L.), narrow-leafed lupin (Lupinus angustifolius L.), yellow lupin (L. luteus L.), white lupin (L. albus L.), canola (Brassica napus L.), chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.), faba bean (Vicia faba L.) and lentil (Lens culinaris Medik) were all increasingly grown in rotation with spring wheat.  Consequently, the Zn requirement of the new crops was compared with the Zn requirements of spring wheat.  Species requiring less Zn than spring wheat to produce the same relative yield were faba bean, chickpea, albus lupin and canola; species requiring more Zn were lentil and durum wheat.  

Spreadsheet models were developed to determine when re-application of fertiliser Zn was required for low and high production systems.  Relative to freshly-applied Zn, the rate of decline in the RV of Zn applied in a previous year varied depending on the amount of Zn applied, time the Zn was in contact with soil since application, properties of the soil (soil pH, % clay, % organic carbon, % free calcium carbonate), plant species, and the amount of Zn removed in harvested grain or hay.

The thesis has culminated in a better understanding of Zn in the agricultural production systems of WA.  The distribution and correction of Zn deficiency is now predictable for the many soil types and cropping systems of WA.  Accurate identification of Zn deficiency for a range of crop and pasture species by plant analyses, typically the youngest mature leaf, is now possible for local conditions.  With the calibration of the DTPA Zn soil test for soils of WA, particularly for wheat the major crop species grown in WA, prognosis of potential Zn deficiency can now be predicted before the appearance of Zn deficiency or loss in plant production.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">zinc</field><field name="subject">plant availability</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20050602.142302</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Exp&#233;dition aux Terres Australes A Web-based Online Role-play Simulation: the enhancement of language acquisition through social interaction</field><field name="creator">hartlv@perth.training.wa.gov.au</field><field name="description">This research project investigates to what extent a social constructivist approach to

this historic event. Being in a third year TAFE French class, the students had already
been exposed to sound grounding in grammar, relevant vocabulary, and use of

provided the students with their identity which was unknown to the other participants
during the simulation; created incidents through a weekly &#147;Course of Events&#148;
announcement; answered all questions within 12 &#150; 24 hours; encouraged engagement
within the learning community; made occasional suggestions if the characters seemed
uncertain of what to do next; and, above all, endeavoured to create a non-threatening,
friendly online environment for the students.
After the four-week online role-play simulation, the participants met for a debriefing
session in which they revealed their identities and discussed any issues, in particular
technical issues, that had emerged. This provided an opportunity for the participants
to disengage from the virtual world in which they have been immersed for four weeks
as well as an opportunity to reflect upon their personal learning.
A qualitative methodology, drawing on interpretive research, was employed to
analyse the data. Student pre- and post-questionnaires, online contributions by the
students and the debriefing discussion were used as the major sources of data
collection.
Most of the students took up the challenge of interacting online through asynchronous
and synchronous communication. The study focused on how the use of a social
constructivist epistemology could enhance language acquisition for learners of foreign
languages and also analysed to what extent did the students&#146; participation in a webbased
online role-play simulation affect their communication skills and fluency in the
second language.
The findings provided me with guidance for future implementation of online role-play
simulations in which I would ensure that all students have the basic computer skills
and necessary access to internet in order to participate fully in the simulation.
Nevertheless, this study demonstrated many benefits to the language enhancement of
the participants and will become a regular activity as it permits students to use their
conversational skills in a &#147;real-life&#148; virtual learning community.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">online</field><field name="subject">roleplay</field><field name="subject">simulation</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20050603.151117</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Micropolitics of Gender at Work Leading women in education rocking the boat and moving on</field><field name="creator">cpeters@westnet.com.au</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates the experiences of 21 women in leadership and management who chose to leave their positions in the central office of a large state education department in Australia between 1991 and 2001, despite a record of high achievement and, for most, many years of loyal service. In particular, I identified why the women left and elements of the organisational culture that altered their career directions. The study adds to existing knowledge about women in management in Australia and the phenomenon of &#145;the glass ceiling&#146; (generally understood to refer to an invisible barrier which prevents women, because they are women, from advancing beyond low to middle levels of organisational management). It demonstrates that the few women who do make it into senior management positions often encounter resistance to their acceptance at that level where the predominantly male managers exclude those who are different. 

Using a qualitative research approach with in-depth, open-ended interviewing techniques drawn from a critical feminist perspective, I worked with the interviewees to explore their experiences as women in organisational management. In combining a phenomenological approach with critical reflection I aimed to create a dialogue on lived experiences while at the same time using theory to inform and reflect on those experiences. My focus shifts back and forth from the women&#146;s stories, related in their own voices, to my critical interpretation through a feminist lens, of their life-worlds. 

The sample ranged from women leading projects and special programs to directors, executive directors and chief executives. All, with one or two exceptions , encountered barriers and described gendered micropolitical processes at work. The loss of talent is central to the research. The findings suggest that more could be done to retain women of high potential and, more broadly, to value talented and &#145;different&#146; individuals who may disrupt the traditional understanding of &#145;manager&#146; or &#145;leader&#146;.  
  
In a profound questioning of the corporate culture the research participants identified the micropolitical processes at work that often blocked career progress. They questioned political game playing, factional politics, unwritten rules, gatekeeping, the exclusiveness of the boys&#146; club, positional power, and the hierarchical and bureaucratic management structure. They observed that relational, inclusive and interactive management styles were not valued in a corporate culture that defined merit in masculinist terms. Many challenged excessive self-promotion and careerist politics; recognised techniques that excluded and marginalised women; and asked why men with mediocre performance records got promotions, often ahead of more qualified, experienced and talented women who worked passionately for &#145;the good of education&#146;.  

Yet these female leaders recognised that behaviours cannot be divided neatly along gender lines. Many of the interviewees cited examples of a new wave of women they considered had become honorary males, responsible for perpetuating rather than resisting deeply entrenched practices, and not supportive of other women. One experienced CEO, who had worked in a wide range of public sector positions, distanced herself from gender debates and rejected feminist arguments that identified leadership as gendered. Adding to the complexity of the stories, other women at executive level talked of survival, the exhaustion of the lone female, the overwhelming weight of expectations from others (both male and female) and the ethical dimension of working in an &#145;alien&#146; environment. As the &#146;90s progressed, social justice discourses were lost in the neoliberal agendas of managerialism and economic rationalism and feminist voices were submerged.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">gender</field><field name="subject">organisations</field><field name="subject">women</field><field name="subject">leadership</field><field name="subject">education</field><field name="subject">micropolitics</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20050705.105434</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Positively Promising: Women's Decision Making Pregnancy and Health Promotion</field><field name="creator">Kafka1@bigpond.com</field><field name="description">This thesis explores the ways in which health promotion campaigns presuppose the pregnant subject and how main stream health promoters construct theories and practices of empowerment, health literacy and rationality.

Two Western Australian main stream health promotion campaigns directed at pregnant women in the period 1996 to 1997 (the time of interviewing) and still current at time of writing, will be analysed and comparisons made with the development of health promotion theory and practice generally. The normalisation of medicallscientific approaches toward pregnancy care and behaviour will be illustrated by providing examples from health promotion literature, medical and health journals, popular pregnancy books, magazines and newspaper stories. The assumption that health literacy is the major attribute necessary to enable empowerment is intenogated and the limitations of this perspective illustrated.

The second part of the thesis deals more directly with the interview material and illustrates how the women interviewed related to, and engaged with, main stream health information. The diversity with the group of middle class women interviewed is highlighted, and the diferent pfulosophical positions they occupy in relation to main stream health information explored. The complexity and contextual situatedness of women's decision making in relation to notions about health literacy, rationality and empowerment is outlined. The concluding chapters of the thesis discuss the most recent developments in main stream health promtion theory, examining the limitations of social capital theory, social marketing and other health promotion strategies. The conclusion imagines the possible benefits for women as health subjects and main stream health promoters as experts, in rethinking rationality and re-supposing women as positive health subjects that are promising rather than permanently risky and in need of improvement.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">health promotion</field><field name="subject">women</field><field name="subject">pregnancy</field><field name="subject">women's decision making</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20050728.132130</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sediment remediation as a technique for restoring eutrophic wetlands and controlling nuisance Chironomidae</field><field name="creator">jchen1232005@yahoo.com.au</field><field name="description">Eutrophication is a global problem affecting many inland and estuarine waters. Many wetlands on the Swan Coast Plain, in Western Australia, have undergone increasing nutrient enrichment since European settlement of the region in the 1850&#146;s. Problems such as algal blooms and nuisance swarms of non-biting midges (Diptera; Chironomidae) are the consequence of nutrient enrichment in many of these wetlands. The restoration of these degraded wetlands, especially with respect to reducing nutrient enrichment, requires a range of comprehensive and effective techniques including catchment management, diversion or treatment of surface inputs and treatment of enriched sediments. Nitrogen and phosphorus, especially phosphorus, are not the only factors controlling algal biomass in water bodies, but they are the only elements that can be removed efficiently and economically. 

Internal P cycling from wetland sediments can initiate and sustain eutrophication and related algal blooms and nuisance midge problems even after external sources are diverted or reduced. The aim of this study was to identify an effective material to reduce sediment phosphorus release and thereby the phosphorus concentration of the water column. It was also important to determine the impact of the selected amendment material on phytoplankton and larval midge (chironomid) communities. 

A range of experiments at increasing scales, from bench-top, to microcosm to outdoor mesocosm experiments were designed to test three hypotheses:

1)	Materials which have a high P sorption capacity, over a wide range of P solution concentrations, and low P release rate, are potentially suitable agents to reduce P in wetlands with enriched sediments by inactivating sediment P;
2)	A reduction in the abundance of cyanobacteria caused by increasing the N:P ratio of an aquatic ecosystem results in a reduction in the density of nuisance species of Chironomidae. 

3)	Successful amendment of enriched sediments reduces P in the water column thereby reducing the total phytoplankton biomass and the related density of nuisance species of Chironomidae. 

The adsorption and desorption experiments were carried out under a range of pH values and P concentrations, with a number of materials including fly ash, red mud, precipitated calcium carbonate, crushed limestone and lime to determine the maximum adsorption capacity and affinity of these materials. A rang of P concentrations (0-1000 &#181;g/L) simulated the P concentration of the water column in a range of wetlands of differing trophic status. Poor fits to the Langmuir equation occurred with both red mud and fly ash due to their high P content. A good fit occurred with lime, with a high P removal rate (90%-96%) over the same range. Fly ash and red mud were eliminated from further investigation due to the possibility that they might release phosphorus rather than absorb when P concentrations in surrounding environment were less than 300 &#181;g/L or 200 &#181;g/L respectively (concentrations which can occur in eutrophic systems).

Among the three lime-based, redox-insensitive materials tested in the second mesocosm experiments, precipitated calcium carbonate (PCC) possessed the highest maximum adsorption capacity and lowest desorption rate under a range of pH values (6.2, 7.2 and 10) and P concentrations (0-12 000 &#181;g/L), followed by crushed limestone and lime. The different maximum absorption capacities of the three materials appears to be mainly attributed to their particle size (surface area). 

Lime was chosen as the amendment material for further investigation because it was the only one of the three available in sufficient quantities within the timeframe of this study.

Microcosm experiments showed that lime was effective in reducing sediment P release from intact sediment cores, and the ratio of TN:TP in the treatment cores increased over time compared to the control cores (in which TN: TP decreased slightly).

In the first mesocosm experiment a significantly higher density of larval midges was found in the treatments than in the controls. The treatments were aimed to increase N:P ratio in the systems to reduce cyanobacteria and, subsequently, larval midge densities. However even though cyanobacteria were eliminated from the treatments, the nitrogen addition appeared to result in higher phytoplankton biomass overall, which fuelled an increase in larval midge densities. 

In the second mesocosm experiment, the addition of lime to enriched sediments resulted in a reduction in P in the water column.  This reduction was accompanied by a reduction in total phytoplankton biomass, the absence of cyanobacteria, and a less abundant and more species - diverse chironomid fauna in the treatment mesocosms.

Sediment P fractionation undertaken for both the microcosm and mesocosm experiments showed that most of the phosphorus adsorbed by lime was in the labile fraction (NH3Cl extractable P and NaOH extractable P). Phosphorus in the HCl extractable fraction was also found to be higher in the treatments due to the presence of inert mineral P in the lime than the formation of new hydroxyapatite from adsorbed P. 

The two mesocosm experiments suggested that larval midges were non-selective feeders, responding to total phytoplankton biomass, rather than the presence of cyanobacteria. Dissolved oxygen and predation also influenced larval midge densities. 

In summary, although lime appeared to be a useful material for reducing P release from enriched sediments under controlled laboratory conditions, the effect under field conditions was not as definitive. Further work is required to more fully determine the conditions under which sediment remediation may be used as a means of controlling sediment P release and associated high densities of larval chironomids.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">eutrophic wetlands</field><field name="subject">sediment remediation</field><field name="subject">algal bloom control</field><field name="subject">nuisance chironomidae</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20050817.102759</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Interactive Television and Tourism Marketing WA to the UK Pleasure Travel Market through Interactive Television Applications</field><field name="creator">A.Schweda@murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">As an information intensive industry and as one of the most progressive industries in information technology adoption, travel and tourism provides an ideal context in which to investigate how new technologies such as interactive television challenge our understanding of media and media use.  This research looks at how interactive television can be used by consumers and how it may be best applied by marketers in international holiday travel.

Using the UK international traveller market to Western Australia as case in point, this research had three main research goals: 1) to understand how travellers use information sources with a focus on interactive television; 2) how an individual&#146;s previous interactive media and travel experiences may pre-dispose them to using interactive television; and 3) to better understand why individuals interact and what impact the interaction has on the promotional effort.  A travel ad and a travel show segment were used to explore these with impulse (brochure request) and telescopic (destination video) interactive opportunities.  The treatments were deployed over a video-on-demand platform in greater London and participants took part in their homes via their televisions and a self administered questionnaire.

This research has furthered the use of the multi-dimensional grid in understanding information sources in relationship to one another and updated the landscape with modern information sources such as television, teletext, the Internet and interactive television.  Findings from this area of investigation suggest that current interactive television offerings cater better to short-haul destinations and although it currently plays a minor role, interactive television has the potential to significantly contribute to travellers&#146; long-haul holiday planning process.

The finding that individuals understand interactive television through their experience with teletext rather than the Internet and are more likely to use interactive television if they are thorough and experienced planners supports the theory of knowledge transference.  However, most importantly, if an individual has a positive experience with interactive television they will interact again in the future.  Contributions were also made to a better understanding of the interactive television user and the use of interactive television applications to the travel and tourism industry in particular.  Exploration of the differences between the Impulse and Telescopic approaches to interactivity highlighted that while interactivity generally enhances the promotional effort each approach has its own strategic applications.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">interactibe television</field><field name="subject">tourism</field><field name="subject">long-haul travel</field><field name="subject">tourist information services</field><field name="subject">holiday planning</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20050930.104954</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterisation of Community-Derived Hymenolepis Infections in Australia</field><field name="creator">Marion.Macnish@abcrc.org.au</field><field name="description">Hymenolepis nana is a ubiquitous parasite, found throughout many developing and developed
countries. Globally, the prevalence of H. nana is alarmingly high, with estimates of up to 75
million people infected. In Australia, the rates of infection have increased substantially in the
last decade, from less than 20% in the early 1990&#146;s to 55 - 60% in these same communities
today. Our knowledge of the epidemiology of infection of H. nana is hampered by the
confusion surrounding the host specificity and taxonomy of this parasite. The suggestion of the
existence of two separate species, Hymenolepis nana von Siebold 1852 and Hymenolepis
fraterna Stiles 1906, was first proposed at the beginning of the 20th century. Despite ongoing
discussions in the subsequent years it remained unclear, some 90 years later, whether there were
two distinct species, that are highly host specific, or whether they were simply the same species
present in both rodent and human hosts. The ongoing controversy surrounding the taxonomy of
H. nana has not yet been resolved and remains a point of difference between the taxonomic and
medical literature.

The epidemiology of infection with H. nana in Australian communities is not well understood
as the species present in these communities has never been identified with certainty. It is not
clear which form of transmission commonly occurs in Australia, whether the H. nana
&#145;strain/species&#146; present in the north-west of Western Australia is present in human and rodent
hosts, or whether humans harbour their own &#145;strain/sub-species&#146; of Hymenolepis. Furthermore,
it is not known whether mice are a potential zoonotic source for transmission of Hymenolepis to
human hosts. In this study, 51 human isolates of H. nana were inoculated into highly
susceptible laboratory rodent species. However, these failed to develop into adult worms in all
instances, including when rodent species were chemically and genetically immunosuppressed.In addition, 24 of these human isolates were also cross-tested in the flour beetle intermediate
host, Tribolium confusum. Of these, only one isolate developed to the cysticercoid stage in
beetles, yet when inoculated into laboratory rodents, the cysticercoids also failed to develop into
adult stage.

Since isolates of H. nana infecting humans and rodents are morphologically indistinguishable,
the only way they can be reliably identified is by comparing the parasite in each host using
molecular criteria. In the current study, three regions of ribosomal DNA, the small subunit
(18S), the first internal transcribed spacer (ITS1) and the intergenic spacer (IGS) were chosen
for genetic characterisation of Hymenolepis spp. from rodent and human hosts from a broad
geographic range. In addition, a mitochondrial gene, the cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (C01)
gene and a non-ribosomal nuclear gene, paramyosin, were characterised in a number of
Hymenolepis isolates from different hosts.

A small PCR fragment of 369 bp, plus a larger fragment of 1223 bp, were sequenced from the
18S gene of reference isolates of H. nana and the rat tapeworm H. diminuta. Minimal sequence
variation was found in the two regions of the 18S between these two morphologically distinct,
phylogenetically recognised species, H. nana and H. diminuta, and this indicated that the 18S
gene was too conserved for further genetic characterisation of isolates of H. nana from different
hosts.

A large number of human isolates of H. nana (104) were characterised at the ITS1 using PCRrestriction
length fragment polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). The profiles obtained were highly
variable and often exceeded the original size of the uncut fragment. This was highly suggestive
of the existence of ribosomal spacers that, whilst identical in length, were highly variable in
sequence. To overcome the problems of the variable PCR-RFLP profiles, further
characterisation of the ITS1, by cloning and sequencing 23 isolates of H. nana, was conducted
and this confirmed the existence of spacers which, although similar in length (approximately
646 bp), differed in their primary sequences. The sequence differences led to the separation of
the isolates into two clusters when analysed phylogenetically. This sequence variation was not,
however, related to the host of origin of the isolate, thus was not a marker of genetic distinction
between H. nana from rodents and humans. Indeed, the levels of variability were often higher
within an individual isolate than between isolates, regardless of whether they were collected
from human or mice hosts, which was problematic for phylogenetic analysis. In addition, mixed
parasite infections of H. nana and the rodent tapeworm H. microstoma were identified in four
humans in this study, which was unexpected and surprising, as there have been no previous
reports in the literature documenting humans as definitive hosts for this parasite. Further studies
are required, however, to determine if the detection of H. microstoma in humans reflects a
genuine, patent infection or an atypical, accidental occurrence.

Sequencing of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase 1 gene (C01) in a number of isolates of
Hymenolepis nana from rodents and humans identified a phylogenetically supported genetic
divergence of approximately 5% between some mouse isolates compared to isolates of H. nana
from humans. This provided evidence that the mitochondrial C01 gene was useful for
identifying genetic divergences in H. nana that were not resolvable using nuclear loci. Despite
a morphological identity between isolates of H. nana from rodent and human hosts, the genetic
divergence observed between isolates at the mitochondrial locus was highly suggestive that
H. nana is a species complex, or &#147;cryptic&#148; species (= morphologically identical yet genetically
distinct). In addition, whilst not supported by high bootstrap values, a clustering of the
Australian human isolates into one uniform genetic group that was phylogenetically separated
from all the mouse isolates was well supported by biological data obtained in this study. To confirm the phylogeny of the C01 tree a small segment of the nuclear gene, paramyosin, was
sequenced in a number of isolates from humans and rodents. However, this gene did not
provide the level of heterogeneity required to distinguish between isolates from rodent and
human hosts. The high sequence conservation of the paramyosin gene characterised in this
study did not refute the finding that H. nana may be a cryptic species that is becoming host
adapted. It simply did not provide additional data to that already obtained.

A DNA fingerprinting tool, PCR-RFLP, of the ribosomal intergenic spacer (IGS), was
developed in this study in order to evaluate its usefulness in tracing particular genotypes within
a community, thus determining transmission patterns of H. nana between rodent and human
hosts. Analysis of the IGS of numerous H. nana isolates by PCR-RFLP identified the presence
of copies of the IGS that, whilst similar in length, differed in their sequence. Similar to that
observed in the ITS1, the existence of different IGS copies was found in both rodent and human
isolates of H. nana, thus the variability was not evidence of the existence of a rodent- or humanspecific
genotype. Evaluation of the intergenic spacer (IGS) as a fingerprinting tool suggests
that this region of DNA is too variable within individuals and thus, cannot be effectively used
for the study of transmission patterns of the tapeworm H. nana between different hosts.

In summary, it appears that the life cycle of H. nana that exists in remote communities in the
north-west of Western Australia is likely to involve mainly &#145;human to human&#146; transmission.
This is supported by both the biological and genetic data obtained for the mitochondrial locus in
this study. The role of the intermediate hosts, such as Tribolium spp., in the Hymenolepis life
cycle is still unclear, however it would appear that it may be greatly reduced in the transmission
of this parasite in remote Australian communities. In the future, it is recommended that further
genetic characterisation of faster evolving mitochondrial genes, and/or suitable nuclear genes be
characterised in a larger number of isolates of H. nana. The use of techniques which can
combine the characterisation of genotype and phenotype, such as proteomics, may also be
highly valuable for studies on H. nana from different hosts.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">hymenolepis</field><field name="subject">molecular epidemiology</field><field name="subject">parasite</field><field name="subject">zoonoses</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20050930.111325</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The influence of discouragement, anxiety and anger on pain: An examination of the role of endogenous opioids</field><field name="creator">Ash_Frew@yahoo.com.au</field><field name="description">Animal research suggests that exposure to inescapable stressors can lead to an endogenous opioid-mediated form of pain inhibition, known as stress-induced analgesia (SIA). Similar results have been found with humans, although the literature is much less extensive and at times contradictory where uncontrollable stressors have led to an increase, rather than a decrease in pain. More recently, there has been some suggestion that emotions play an important role in pain modulation, and that particular negative moods are associated with opioid-mediated hypoalgesia. This research aimed to clarify the psychological (cognitive and affective) factors underlying endogenous opioid-mediated pain inhibition in humans. 

The purpose of Study 1 was to examine the effects of stressor controllability and predictability on pain intensity (PI) and unpleasantness (UP) ratings during a cold pressor task (CPT) in 56 male and female subjects. The stressor involved a timed mental arithmetic task during which three moderately noxious electrical shocks were delivered. Although subjects were informed that shock delivery was contingent on math performance, the shock schedule was preset and identical across conditions. Perceived control over the shocks was manipulated between subjects by altering the difficulty of the math task. Shock predictability was manipulated by changing the colour of the computer screen to warn of an impending shock. Subjects were randomly allocated to four experimental conditions (controllable-predictable, controllable-unpredictable, uncontrollable-predictable, and uncontrollable-unpredictable shocks). Visual analogue ratings of &#145;perceived self-efficacy&#146; (to avoid the shocks) and mood (anxiety, confusion, discouragement, anger, sluggishness, liveliness) were completed before, during and after the math task. Significantly greater discouragement and lower self-efficacy was reported in &#145;uncontrollable&#146; conditions indicating that &#145;controllability&#146; was manipulated effectively. Results indicated that a perceived lack of control over shocks during the math task led to significantly greater decreases in PI, but not UP, ratings during the last stages of a 4-minute fixed interval CPT after the math task. Shock predictability failed to influence subjective pain ratings alone; however, unpredictability interacted with lack of control to initially increase pain, followed by analgesia. Stress-induced increases in negative affect (anxiety, discouragement, anger) were associated with decreases in cold pressor PI, but with increased shock PI and UP during the math task. It was concluded that lack of control over an aversive event and negative affect led to SIA during a prolonged pain stimulus, whereas shock predictability had little influence 
on pain. 

In Study 2, 70 male and female subjects received either an opioid antagonist (naltrexone) or a placebo before the math task (using a double-blind, counterbalanced design), in order to determine the role of endogenous opioids in SIA. Subjects were randomly assigned to one of three experimental conditions to investigate whether the shocks themselves may have contributed to analgesia observed after the math task: (1) easy task-few shocks, (2) hard task-few shocks, 
(3) hard task-many shocks. Increases in systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), anxiety, anger and discouragement indicated that negative affect and sympathetic arousal were induced during the math task. Endogenous opioids inhibited the rise in anger, but not discouragement or anxiety, during the math task. There was some evidence that perceived lack of control over shocks, and not the shocks themselves, led to opioid-mediated decreases in cold pressor UP after the math task. In correlational analyses, discouraged subjects under opioid blockade reported more cold pressor UP after the math task than their placebo counterparts. However, this effect was not strong enough to reach statistical significance in regression analyses. Anxiety, anger, discouragement and lack of control over shocks increased shock PI and UP during the math task. 

A growing body of research with normotensive subjects has linked increased cardiovascular activity with insensitivity to pain, but the role of endogenous opioids remains contentious. In addition to the investigations outlined above, Study 2 aimed to examine the contribution of endogenous opioids in the cardiovascular-pain relationship. However, there was no evidence of an interaction between pain and cardiovascular activity in this study.

Study 3 was carried out to investigate opioid involvement in the effects of an uncontrollable stressor and stress-induced negative mood on cold pressor PI, UP and pain tolerance, and onset/thresholds of the nociceptive flexion reflex (RIII). Forty-three male and female subjects were administered either naltrexone or a placebo using a double-blind, counterbalanced design before completing a timed mental arithmetic stressor (identical to the &#145;hard task-many shocks&#146; condition in Study 2). Increases in physiological (SBP, DBP) and affective measures (anxiety, anger and discouragement) indicated that the math task induced a marked state of stress. Negative affect increased shock PI and UP during the task, whereas self-efficacious subjects taking the placebo experienced less shock pain. However, uncontrollable stress led to an opioid-antagonised increase in cold pressor UP. Stressor controllability had a similar, but marginal, effect on cold pressor PI, but not pain tolerance. Tolerance of cold pressor pain was not associated with subjective PI and UP ratings, but was positively associated with endurance to non-painful, but unpleasant tasks (Valsalva Manoeuvre, Letter-Symbol Matching Task), indicating that pain tolerance was measuring the ability to tolerate discomfort, in addition to pain. Results of hierarchical multiple regressions demonstrated that increases in discouragement were positively related to increases in cold pressor UP after the math task, for naltrexone recipients only. These findings suggest that discouragement inhibits the UP of a prolonged pain stimulus via opioid mechanisms. RIII latencies and thresholds were not affected by the math task or by opioid blockade; however, these null effects may be due to methodological limitations. Unlike Study 2, higher blood pressure was associated with shock and cold pressor pain inhibition in normotensive subjects, and this relationship appeared to be mediated by opioids.

The strong association between chronic pain and depression has led to speculation that the endogenous opioid system and pain modulatory mechanisms may be impaired in depression. At the time that this research was carried out, no studies had examined whether this was the case. In Study 4, the effect of a cognitive stressor (math task used in Study 3) on foot cold pressor PI, UP and pain tolerance and the nociceptive, or R2 component, of the blink reflex was investigated in 61 participants with or without major depression (as met by DSM-IV diagnostic criteria and confirmed by psychometric testing). Naltrexone or placebo was administered to subjects an hour before the math task using a double-blind, counterbalanced design. Increases in physiological (SBP, DBP) and affective measures (anxiety, anger and discouragement) confirmed that the math task induced the targeted emotional state. An opioid-mediated reduction in anxiety occurred mid-way through the math task. Opioid-mediated decreases in foot cold pressor PI and UP were observed in depressed and non-depressed subjects after the math task. R2 onset to 10 mA was facilitated after the task regardless of opioid blockade, suggesting that endogenous opioids are not involved in the modulation of the BR. Increased anxiety and discouragement led to opioid-mediated inhibition of shock PI and UP during the task and, to a lesser extent, foot cold pressor PI and UP after the math task. Anger increased shock pain without being influenced by opioid blockade. Pain tolerance was not influenced by depression, opioid blockade or mood. These findings failed to support the idea that SIA is impaired in major depression, suggesting instead that uncontrollable aversive events and negative mood (anxiety, discouragement) lead to opioid activation and insensitivity to acute pain. Multiple regression analyses revealed that the inverse relationship between resting blood pressure and foot cold pressor PI and UP was opioid-mediated in controls only, suggesting that opioid dysregulation in depression might influence regulatory functions other than SIA. 

In Study 4, opioid involvement in hetero-segmental pain inhibitory phenomena termed diffuse noxious inhibitory controls (DNIC) was examined separately, before psychological stress. Specifically, the effect of a heterotopic noxious conditioning stimulus (CS i.e., hand CPT) on R2 onset latency was compared before and after drug absorption (before the math task). An inhibitory effect of the first CS was detected at each electrical stimulus intensity consistent with a DNIC effect. However, this effect was not detected during the second CS, suggesting that some other process masked the DNIC effect. 

In summary, the findings indicate that uncontrollable aversive events and negative emotion (primarily discouragement) activates endogenous opioids and inhibits pain in human subjects, whether depressed or not. Notably, opioids inhibited the affective component of pain perception, or pain UP, more consistently than PI, suggesting that the antinociceptive function of opioids may be secondary to an important emotional-modulatory role. Endogenous opioids also appeared to mediate the cardiovascular-pain relationship in normotensive non-depressed subjects, suggesting an important stress-regulatory role for these peptides. Opioid-mediated masking of this relationship in major depression suggests that functioning of the endogenous opioid system may be impaired in baroreceptor-mediated analgesia. This finding provides preliminary support for the notion that opioid antinociceptive system dysfunction may contribute to cardiovascular disease in depression.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">negative mood</field><field name="subject">pain</field><field name="subject">endogenous opioids</field><field name="subject">depression</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20050930.111852</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Beyond the Pink:(Post) Youth Iconography in Cinema</field><field name="creator">x1999@iinet.net.au</field><field name="description">Beyond the Pink: (Post) Youth Iconography in Cinema is a project in cultural time travel.  It cuts up linear cinematic narratives to develop a hop-scotched history of youth, Generation X and (post) youth culture.  I focus upon the pleasures, pedagogies and (un)popular politics of a filmic genre that continues to be dismissed as unworthy of intellectual debate.  Accelerated culture and the discourse of celebrity have blurred the crisp divisions between fine art and crude commodity, the meaningful and meaningless, and real and fictive, unsettling the binary logic that assigns importance to certain texts and not others.  This research project prises open that awkward space between representation and experience.
 
Analysts require methods and structures through which to manage historical change and textual movement.  Through cinema, macro-politics of identity emerge from the micro-politics of the narrative.  Prom politics and mallrat musings become imbued with social significance that speak in the literacies available to youth.  It grants the ephemerality and liminality of an experience a tactile trace.  I select moments of experience for Generation X youth and specific icons &#150; Happy Harry Hardon, Molly Ringwald, the Spice Girls, the Bitch, the invisible raver, teen time travellers Marty McFly and Donnie Darko, and the slacker &#150; to reveal the archetypes and ideologies that punctuate the cinematic landscape.  The tracked figures do not configure a smooth historical arc.  It is in the rifts and conflicts of diverse narratives and subjectivities where attention is focused.  

This research imperative necessitates the presentation of a series of essays arranged in a tripartite framework.  The first section proposes theoretical paradigms for a tethered analysis of filmic texts and Generation X.  The second segment explores sites of struggle in public spaces and time.  The final section leaves the landscape of post-Generation X to forge the relationship between history, power and youth identity.  I particularly focus on the iconography, ideologies and imaginings of young women to lead the discussion of the shifts in the experience and representations of youth.  By reinserting women into studies of film, it is imperative to stress that this is not a dissertation in, and of, women&#146;s cinema.  Rather, it serves as an historical corrective to the filmic database.  

The existing literature on youth cinema is disappointing and narrow in its trajectories.  Timothy Shary&#146;s Generation Multiplex: The Image of Youth in Contemporary American Cinema and Jon Lewis&#146; The Road to Romance and Ruin: Teen Films and Youth Culture exemplify the difficulties of capturing the complexities of individual films when they are collated in artificial and stifling categories.  At one end of the analytical spectrum is the critique that comes with the caveat of &#145;it&#146;s just another teen movie&#146;.  Jonathon Bernstein&#146;s monograph Pretty in Pink: The Golden Age of Teenage Movies is one such example which derails into acerbic diatribes and intellectual dismissal.  The Cinema of Generation X: A Critical Study by Peter Hanson is a more successful project that is interested in the influences that inform a community of filmmakers than arriving at a catalogue of generic themes and narratives.  There is an emphasis on the synergy between text, producer and readership.

I continue this relationship explored by Hanson, but further accent the politics of film.  The original contribution to knowledge offered by this doctoral thesis is a detailed study of (post) youth popular culture, building into a model for Generation X cinema, activating the interdisciplinary perspectives from film and cultural studies.  With its adaptability into diverse media forms, cultural studies paradigms allow navigation through the expansive landscape of popular culture.  It traverses beyond simple textual analyses to consider a text&#146;s cultural currency.  As an important carrier of meaning and sensory memories, cinema allows for alternative accounts that are denied in authorised history.  As a unique form with its own visual literacy, screen theory is needed to refine observations.  This unique melding of screen and cultural studies underscores the convergent relationship between text, readership, production and politics.

This doctoral thesis activates concepts and methods of generationalism, nationalism, social history and cultural practice.  There is a dialogue between the chapters that crosses over text and time.  The 1980s of Molly Ringwald shadows the dystopia of Donnie Darko.  The celebrity status of the Spice Girls clashes with the frustrated invisibility of the female raver.  Douglas Coupland&#146;s vision of Generation X in 1991 has evolved into Richard Linklater&#146;s documentation of post-youth in the new millenium.  Leaping between decades through time travel in cinema, I argue that the nostalgic past and projections for the future evoke the preoccupations and anxieties of the present.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">youth cinema</field><field name="subject">popular culture</field><field name="subject">generation x</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20050930.124547</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Liberating the Disabled Identity: A Coalition of Subjugated Knowledges</field><field name="creator">Rose_gal@bigpond.net.au</field><field name="description">My thesis explores the notion, originally developed by sociologists such as Goffman and Charmaz, that a person&#146;s identity undergoes a difficult and painful metamorphosis in response to the effects of serious long-term impairment or chronic illness. I argue that existing methods of researching what I have come to call &#147;the disabled identity&#148; generally avoid a deeper exploration of the social context in which this kind of marginalisation occurs. To address this absence, I develop a research methodology which combines an intensive exploration of the personal experience of disability with a critical analysis of the social and historical context in which the disabling of identity occurs. I approach the former through grounded theory and the latter through a Foucaultian analytics of genealogy and governmentality. These are informed by the theoretical insights surrounding the &#147;social model&#148; of disability which claims that &#147;disability&#148; is not a physical problem based on personal tragedy but is a social imposition based on exclusion and stigmatisation. 

In accordance with this, the thesis proceeds in three successive stages. First, I apply a genealogical analysis to disability in general, then more specifically to the disabled identity, to provide the background for my qualitative research. The purpose of genealogy is to reveal that the concept under investigation is not a self-evident &#147;given&#148; but a social construction which has developed to serve varying interests over time. Through this process it becomes evident that disability has evolved as a concept which performs as a counterpoint to the norm and, as such, provides a measure of &#147;what not to be&#148; in terms of contemporary neoliberal citizenship. 

Next, I engage in a grounded theory study which draws on the stories of disabled people to explore how their self-perceptions and the attitudes of those around them have been affected by disability. These stories stem from a variety of data sources, including my dialogues with participants, written stories from participants, and published autobiographies. Their analysis results in the emergence of the following themes: independence, occupational identity, and sexuality/appearance. Each theme is discussed in a separate chapter which attempts to let the stories speak for themselves by way of lengthy excerpts from the participants and texts, and combines them, where relevant, with my own insights and experiences as a disabled person.

In the final stage, I use a governmentality analysis to explore these themes and to place them in their current social and historical context. Here I suggest that independence, work and sexuality are key factors which are used to divide the affiliated from the marginalised in contemporary neoliberal societies. I argue that the two &#147;technologies&#148; which currently have the most impact on how independence, work and sexuality are governed in relation to disability are welfare reform and sexual rehabilitation. Here I explore the available primary sources - particularly the last five years of Australian government policy on welfare reform and a selection of sexual rehabilitation texts - to reveal how governance seeks to operate as a liberatory force while remaining oppressive due to its paternalism and reinforcement of normative prescriptions. 

The final chapter further problematises disability in relation to the governmental concepts of &#147;self-esteem&#148; and &#147;empowerment&#148; in an attempt to unpick what can be claimed to be emancipatory from what remains embedded in the dominant discourse. By &#145;deconstructing necessity&#146; and exploring the root causes of oppression through what Foucault refers to as &#145;the disinterment of subjugated knowledges&#146;, the thesis outlines an alternative discourse in relation to &#147;disability&#148; and opens up new possibilities for the creation of more positive identities.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">disability</field><field name="subject">identity</field><field name="subject">social model</field><field name="subject">qualitative</field><field name="subject">foucault</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20051011.122747</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Invisible Empire: Border Protection on the Electronic Frontier</field><field name="creator">Mkent@iinet.net.au</field><field name="description">The first codes of the Internet made their tentative steps along the information highway in 1969, connecting two computers at UCLA. Since that time, the Internet has grown beyond institutions of research and scholarship. It is now a venue for commerce, popular culture and political discourse. The last decade, following the development of the World Wide Web, has seen access to the Internet, particularly in wealthy countries such as Australia, spread throughout the majority of the population. While this proliferation of users has created many opportunities, it also profiled questions of disadvantage. The development and continuation of a digital divide between the information &#145;haves&#146; and &#145;have nots&#146; was framed as a problem of &#145;access.&#146; In the context of the increasing population online, debates into social inequity have been directed at technical barriers to access, the physical infrastructure and economic impediments to the adoption of the medium by all members of society. 

This doctoral research probes questions of access with greater subtlety, arching beyond the spread of broadband or the expansion of computers into schools. Forging dialogues between Internet and Cultural Studies, new theories of the screen &#150; as a barrier and border &#150; emerge. It is an appropriate time for such a study. The (seemingly) ever expanding growth in Internet access is stalling. New approaches are required to not only understand the pattern of events, but the type and mode of intervention that is possible.

This doctoral research takes theory, politics and policy to the next stage in the history of digital access. By forging interdisciplinary dialogues, the goal is to develop the concept of &#145;cultware&#146;. This term, building on the history of hardware, software and wetware, demonstrates the imperative of understanding context in the framing and forging of exclusion and disempowerment. Mobilising the insights of postcolonial theory, Popular Cultural Studies, literacy theory and socio-legal studies, a new network of exclusions emerge that require a broader palette of interventionary strategies than can be solved through infrastructure or freeing codes. Commencing with the Universal Service Obligation, and probing the meaning of each term in this phrase and policy, there is a discussion of networks and &#145;gates&#146; of the Digital Empire. Discussions then follow of citizenship, sovereignty, nationalism and the subaltern. By applying the insights of intellectual culture from the analogue age, there is not only an emphasis on the continuities between &#145;old&#146; and &#145;new&#146; media, but a confirmation of how a focus on &#145;the new&#146; can mask the profound perpetuation of analogue injustices.  

Access to the Invisible Empire occurs for each individual in a solitary fashion. Alone at the screen, each person is atomised at the point where they interface with the digital. This thesis dissects that point of access. The three components of access at the screen &#150; hardware, software and wetware &#150; intersect and dialogue. All three components form a matrix of access. However, the ability to attain hardware, software and wetware are distinct. An awareness of how and where to attain these literacies requires the activation of cultware, the context in which the three components manifest. Without such an intersection, access is not possible. The size of the overlap determines the scale of the gateway and the value of access. There is an interaction between each of these components that can alter both the value of the access obtained and the point at which the gateway becomes viable and stable for entry into the digital discourse. A highly proficient user with developed wetware is able to extract more value, capital and currency from hardware and software. They have expert knowledge in the use of this medium in contrast to a novice user. In dissecting the complexity of access, my original contribution to knowledge is developing this concept of cultware and confirming its value in explaining digital inequalities.

This thesis diagnoses the nodes and structures of digital and analogue inequality. Critical and interpretative Internet Studies, inflected and informed by Cultural Studies approaches and theories, offers methods for intervention, providing contextual understanding of the manifestations of power and social justice in a digital environment. In enacting this project, familiar tropes and theories from Cultural Studies are deployed. Particular attention is placed on the insights of postcolonial theorists. The Invisible Empire, following the path of the digital intellectual, seeks to act as a translator between the digital subaltern and the digital citizen. Similarly, it seeks to apply pre-existing off screen theory and methodology to the Invisible Empire, illuminating how these theories can be reapplied to the digitised environment.

Within this context, my research provides a significant and original contribution to knowledge in this field. The majority of analyses in critical and interpretative Internet Studies have centred on the United States and Europe. While correlations can be drawn from these studies, there are features unique to the Australian environment, both socially and culturally, as well as physical factors such as the geographic separation and sparse distribution of the population, that limit the ability to translate these previous findings into an Australian context. The writer, as a white Australian, is liminally positioned in the colonial equation: being a citizen of a (formerly) colonised nation with the relics of Empire littering the symbolic landscape, while also &#150; through presence and language &#150; perpetuating the colonization of the Indigenous peoples. This &#145;in-betweenness&#146; adds discomfort, texture and movement to the research, which is a fundamentally appropriate state to understand the gentle confluences between the digital and analogue.

In this context, the screen is the gateway to the Invisible Empire. However, unlike the analogue gate in the city wall that guards a physical core, these gates guard a non-corporeal Invisible Empire. Whereas barbarians could storm the gates of Rome without the literacy to understand the workings of the Empire within, when an army masses to physically strike at these gates, the only consequences are a broken monitor. Questions cannot be asked at the gate to an Invisible Empire. There is no common space in which the digital subaltern and the digital citizen cohabitate. There is no node at which translation can occur. These gates to the Invisible Empire are numerous. The walls cannot be breached and the gates are only open for the citizenry with the required literacy. This literacy in the codes of access is an absolute requirement to pass the gates of Invisible Empire. The digital citizen transverses these gates alone. It is a point where the off screen self interfaces the digital self. Social interaction occurs on either side of the screen, but not at the gateway itself.  

Resistance within the borders of Invisible Empire is one of the founding ideologies of the Internet, tracing its origin back to the cyberpunk literature that predicted the rise of the network. However this was a resistance to authority, both on and off screen, by the highly literate on screen: the hacker and the cyber-jockey. This thesis addresses resistance to the Invisible Empire from outside its borders. Such an intervention is activated not through a Luddite rejection of technology, but by examining the conditions at the periphery of Empire, the impacts of digital colonisation, and how this potential exclusion can be overcome. Debates around digital literacy have been deliberately removed or bypassed to narrow the debate about the future of the digital environment to a focus on the material commodities necessary to gain access and the potential for more online consumers. Cultware has been neglected.

The Invisible Empire, like its analogue predecessors, reaches across the borders of Nation States, as well as snaking invisibly through and between the analogue population, threatening and breaking down previous understandings of citizenship and sovereignty. It invokes new forms of core-periphery relations, a new type of digital colonialism. As the spread of Internet access tapers, and the borders of Empire close to those caught outside, the condition of the digital subaltern calls for outside intervention, the place of the intellectual to raise consciousness of these new colonial relations, both at the core and periphery.

Recombinant alpha- and beta- tubulin proteins from Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense were expressed as soluble fusion proteins in an E. coli expression system. The recombinant alpha- and beta- tubulins were used to determine the nature of binding of novel trifluralin analogues EPL-AJ 1003, 1007, 1008, 1016 and 1017. Native tubulin from rats was used to determine the extent of binding to mammalian tubulin. The results of this study clearly demonstrate two important aspects of the binding of trifluralins to tubulin. Firstly, they have specific affinity for trypanosomal tubulin compared with mammalian regardless of the chemical composition of the trifluralin analogue tested. Secondly, they have a demonstrably stronger affinity for alpha-tubulin compared with beta-tubulin. In addition, compounds 1007, 1008, 1016 and 1017 have strong binding affinities for alpha-tubulin, with limited binding affinity for mammalian tubulin, which indicates that these compounds selectively bind to trypanosomal tubulin. 

The morphology of bloodstream forms of T. b. rhodesiense exposed to trifluralin analogues was studied using electron microscopy and immunofluorescence to determine the ultrastructural changes these compounds induce as a result of binding to tubulin. All compounds tested induced severe irreparable damage in T. b. rhodesiense, including perturbation of subpellicular microtubules, extensive cytoplasmic swellings, axoneme and paraflagellar rod malformation, disconfiguration around the flagellar pocket and membrane disintegration. These results suggest that the mechanism of action of these trifluralin analogues is through the disruption of polymerization of tubulin into microtubules as a result of binding to alpha-tubulin. 

The potential for recombinant trypanosomal tubulins to be used as vaccine candidates was assessed by monitoring parasitaemia and length of survival of mice immunised with the proteins and challenged with a lethal infection of T. b. rhodesiense. Although all the mice vaccinated with recombinant tubulin developed a patent parasitaemia and did not survive, they were partially protected because their patency period and length of survival were significantly greater than the control groups. Furthermore, plasma collected from mice immunised with recombinant trypanosomal tubulin contained antibodies that recognized tubulin in a soluble extraction from T. b. rhodesiense. The results of this thesis confirm the potential for the structural protein, tubulin, to be used as a target for anti-trypanosomatid drug discovery and vaccine development.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">tubulin</field><field name="subject">trypanosomiasis</field><field name="subject">recombinant protein</field><field name="subject">drug discovery</field><field name="subject">vaccine discovery</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20060315.191003</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Paul&#146;s Paradigm for Ministry in 2 Corinthians: Christ&#146;s Death and Resurrection</field><field name="creator">Evelyn_Ashley@iinet.net.au</field><field name="description">The Christian congregation in Corinth found Paul&#146;s &#147;weak&#148; presentation of the gospel
and his approach to ministry to be scandalous. Recently arrived &#147;apostles&#148; reinforced
and accentuated attitudes the congregation had already imbibed from contemporary
Corinthian culture. As a result many in the congregation were less than satisfied with
Paul&#146;s manner of speech, his apparent lack of &#147;charismatic&#148; qualities, his refusal to
accept money from them, his lack of commendatory letters, and his lifestyle that was
characterised by suffering, affliction, opposition and weakness.
However, Paul&#146;s criteria for evaluating ministry, and by implication God&#146;s criteria,
were significantly different from those of the Corinthian congregation. Key verses
such as 2 Cor 1:9; 3:5; 4:7; 6:7; 12:9 and 13:4 indicate that Paul maintained that
Christian life and ministry generally, and apostolic ministry in particular, must be
carried out through divine power, not human power. His apostolic ministry was valid
because it was exercised as God&#146;s representative, in God&#146;s presence (2:17), with God
as judge (5:10) and as a result of God&#146;s mercy (4:1), not as a result of his own power,
authority, eloquence or charismatic presence.
The theological underpinning for Paul&#146;s approach to ministry is found in 13:4 where
Christ who &#147;was crucified as a result of weakness, but lives as a result of God&#146;s
power&#148; is the model for Paul who &#147;shares in his weakness&#148;, but in ministry to the
Corinthians, also &#147;lives as a result of God&#146;s power&#148;. Paul&#146;s model for ministry was
one of dependence on God. This is most clearly demonstrated in the &#147;affliction&#148; he
experienced in Asia where he despaired of life itself, but in the process learned to rely
on &#147;God who raises the dead&#148;. Thus his suffering, weakness and affliction, far from
being disqualifiers for ministry, were in fact, demonstrations of his authenticity as a
minister whose competency came from God and not from himself (3:6).</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">theology</field><field name="subject">new testament</field><field name="subject">2 corinthians</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20060811.143227</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A critical policy analysis of the Crossroads Review: Implications for higher education in regional Western Australia</field><field name="creator">Editech@iinet.net.au</field><field name="description">This work is a critical policy analysis of the Crossroads Review, especially those aspects of it that are most likely to have a significant impact on higher education in regional Western Australia. It aims to understand the place of higher education in regional Western Australia historically with a view to critiquing current policy directions and the potential consequences of Crossroads. The thesis argues that the ideologies of marketisation and corporatisation are driving current higher education policy and this may significantly damage the long-term viability of regional campuses and learning centres as well as public and private funding allocations. The implications for the dismantling of the social contract (or social democratic settlement) in the knowledge economy is an important issue for regional populations for their continued growth, health, education and welfare. 

The issues examined here are relevant to regional higher education in this State. The purpose of this thesis is to examine the potential policy effects with regard to accessibility of higher education in regional Western Australia. The thesis analyses the advantages and disadvantages of studying in regional WA in the current policy environment where there has been a dramatic shift in ideology from the welfare state to economic rationalism. Factors that impact on higher education in regional Western Australia include the provision of telecommunications services for access to and participation in the knowledge economy. 
The thesis considers the evolution of higher education in Australia in general and more particularly in Western Australia, as it has evolved since its foundations in the mid-nineteenth century to the beginning of the twenty-first century. In this time there have been radical changes in higher education in Australia in line with changes to our society and its place in an increasingly globalised environment. 

The thesis concludes by considering some possible options for the future such as the development of learning communities and branch campuses. In discussing such possible alternative forms of delivery of higher education to regional Western Australia, this thesis seeks to raise awareness in relevant government bodies and in rural and remote communities of their particular higher education needs. It is hoped also to encourage regional communities to become more confident and pro-active in their own endeavours to gain greater access and equity in higher education.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">educaton</field><field name="subject">tertiary</field><field name="subject">rural</field><field name="subject">regional</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20061019.134304</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Thai Cinema as National Cinema: An Evaluative History</field><field name="creator">patsorn_sungsri@hotmail.com</field><field name="description">This dissertation considers Thai cinema as a national text. It portrays and analyses Thai film from the introduction of cinema to Thailand during the reign of King Chulalongkorn (1868-1910) up until the present day (2004). 

At its core, this thesis adopts the ideas of Higson, O&#146;Regan and Dissanayake in considering the cultural negotiation of cinema and the construction of nation.  In this study of Thai National Cinema two principal methods are employed&#151;economic and text-based.  In terms of political economy Thai National Cinema is explored through the historical development of the local film industry, the impact of imported cinema, taxation, censorship and government policy, and the interplay between vertically and horizontally integrated media businesses.  Special attention is paid to the evolving and dynamic role of the ruling class in the local film industry. The dissertation&#146;s text-based analyses concern the social and ideological contexts of these national productions in order to consider extant characteristics of Thai nationhood and how these are either reflected or problematised in Thai Cinema.  
 
Of particular relevance is this dissertation&#146;s emphasis on three resilient and potent signifiers of Thai identity&#151;nation, religion, and monarchy&#151;and their interrelationship and influence in the development of Thai National Cinema. These three &#145;pillars&#146; of Thai society form the basis for organising an understanding of the development of Thai cinematic tradition, now over a century old.  This thesis argues that any discussion of the historical, or current, development of Thai National Cinema must accommodate the pervasive role that these three principal forms of national identity play in formulating Thai society, culture, and politics. The recent challenges of globalisation and postmodernism, as well as the rise of an educated middle-class, provide opportunity for reconceptualizing the relevance of these three pillars. In this way Thai National Cinema can be considered a useful barometer in both reflecting and promoting the construction of Thai identity and thought.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">film</field><field name="subject">cinema</field><field name="subject">Thai</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20061019.145601</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Destructive Discourse: 'Japan-bashing' in the United States, Australia and Japan in the 1980s and 1990s</field><field name="creator">Narrelle Morris</field><field name="description">By the 1960s-70s, most Western commentators agreed that Japan had rehabilitated itself from World War II, in the process becoming on the whole a reliable member of the international community.  From the late 1970s onwards, however, as Japan&#146;s economy continued to rise, this premise began to be questioned.  By the late 1980s, a new &#145;Japan Problem&#146; had been identified in Western countries, although the presentation of Japan as a dangerous &#145;other&#146; was nevertheless familiar from past historical eras.  The term &#145;Japan-bashing&#146; was used by opponents of this negative view to suggest that much of the critical rhetoric about a &#145;Japan Problem&#146; could be reduced to an unwarranted, probably racist, assault on Japan.
  
This thesis argues that the invention and popularisation of the highly-contested label &#145;Japan-bashing&#146;, rather than averting criticism of Japan, perversely helped to exacerbate and transform the moderate anti-Japanese sentiment that had existed in Western countries in the late 1970s and early 1980s into a widely disseminated, heavily politicised and even encultured phenomenon in the late 1980s and 1990s.  Moreover, when the term &#145;Japan-bashing&#146; spread to Japan itself, Japanese commentators were quick to respond.  In fact, the level and the nature of the response from the Japanese side is one crucial factor that distinguishes &#145;Japan-bashing&#146; in the 1980s and 1990s from anti-Japanese sentiment expressed in the West in earlier periods.
  
Ultimately, the label and the practice of &#145;Japan-bashing&#146; helped to transform intellectual and popular discourses about Japan in both Western countries and Japan itself in the 1980s and 1990s.  Moreover, in doing so, it revealed crucial features of wider Western and Japanese perceptions of the global order in the late twentieth century.  Debates about Japan showed, for example, that economic strength had become at least as important as military power to national discourses about identity.  However, the view that Western countries and Japan are generally incompatible, and share few, if any, common values, interests or goals, has been largely discarded in the early twenty-first century, in a process that demonstrated just how constructed, and transitory, such views can be.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Japan-bashing</field><field name="subject">United States</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Japan</field><field name="subject">images</field><field name="subject">Rising Sun</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20061116.153222</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Theravada Treatment and Psychotherapy: An Ecological Integration of Buddhist Tripartite Practice and Western Rational Analysis</field><field name="creator">Aung.Myint@correctiveservices.wa.gov.au</field><field name="description">An assertion that psychotherapy is an independent science and a self-authority on human mind and behaviour has uprooted its connection with philosophy and religion. In practice, the scientist-practitioner model of psychotherapy, a seemingly dualistic model, prefers determinism of science to free will of choice in humans.

In particular, the model does not see reason and emotion as co-conditioning causes of human behaviour and suffering within the interdependent aggregates of self, other, and environment. Instead, it argues for wrong reasoning as the cause of emotional suffering.

In Western thought, such narrative began at the arrival of scripted language and abstract thought in Greek antiquity that has led psychotherapy to think ignorantly that emotions are un-reasonable therefore they are irrational. Only rational thinking can effectively remove un-reasonable emotions.

This belief creates confusion between rational theory and rational method of studying change in emotion because of the belief that science cannot objectively measure emotions. As a result, rational epistemologies that are ignorant of moral and metaphysical issues in human experience have multiplied. These epistemologies not only construct an unchanging rational identity, but also uphold the status of permanent self-authority.

Fortunately, recent developmental psychology and cognitive neuroscience research have quashed such ideas of permanent self-identity and authority.

Buddhist theory of Interdependent Arising and Conditional Relations sees such identity and authority as arisen together with deluded emotional desires of greed and hatred.

These desires co-condition interdependent states of personal feeling and perception (metaphysics), conceptual thinking and consciousness (epistemology) and formation of (moral) emotion and action within the context of self other-environment matrix. Moral choices particularly highlight the intentional or the Aristotelian final cause of action derived from healthy desires by valued meaning makings and interpretations.

Theravada formulation aims to end unhealthy desires and develop the healthy ones within the matrix including the client-clinician-therapeutic environment contexts.

Theravada treatment guides a tripartite approach of practicing empathic ethics, penetrating focus and reflective understanding, which integrates ecologically with Western rational analysis. It also allows scientific method of studying change in emotion by applying the theory of defective desires.

In addition, interdependent dimensions of thinking and feeling understood from Theravada perspective present a framework for developing theory and treatment of self disorders.

Thus, Theravada treatment not only allows scientific method of studying change in emotion and provides an interdependent theory and treatment but also ecologically integrates with Western rational analysis. Moreover, Theravada approach offers an open framework for further development of theoretical and treatment models of psychopathology classified under Western nomenclature.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Psychotherapy</field><field name="subject">buddhist psychology</field><field name="subject">Theravada buddhism</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20071130.121741</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The pastoral academic divide: Impacts and implications for pastoral care</field><field name="creator">kclark@bcgs.wa.edu.au</field><field name="description">Secondary schools in Australia routinely develop organisational constructs to
fulfil their dual obligations of academic teaching and the pastoral care of students.
Although these obligations are closely interrelated, school organisational structures
are frequently dichotomous, differentiating between the academic roles of teachers
and their pastoral responsibilities and can result in a functional divide between the
two sides of the school. Teachers find themselves wearing &#145;two hats&#146;; a subject
teacher and a pastoral carer and thus are required to work in two separate domains,
the academic and the pastoral, each with distinct and different tasks, expectations and
line management. The limited amounts of research available suggest that such an
organisational divide can hinder the work of teachers and lead to some organisational
confusion within the school. This research took the form of a qualitative case study,
based in an independent secondary school in Western Australia. It investigated the
impacts and implications of the notional division between the pastoral and academic
dimensions of the school. The thesis begins with a review of the understanding and
development of pastoral care in schools. The construct of an enabling bureaucracy is
then explored and adopted as a theoretical lens with which to examine the pastoral
care system from the perspective of teachers, students and senior managers.
Narratives are used to present the data. The research findings indicate that alignment
of the pastoral and academic structures, both functionally and culturally, can be
achieved if an enabling approach is employed. Such alignment allows the pastoral
care system to support the primary function of a school which is learning, whilst
retaining its fundamental duty of student care. The study concludes with a
consideration of how an enabling school culture may improve the provision of
pastoral care in schools.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">pastoral</field><field name="subject">school organisation</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20081002.94914</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Parliamentary administration in traditional Westminister [sic] parliaments : reflections on the role of procedure and management</field><field name="creator">Pender, J.

The process depends on rainfall, soil, vegetation and
topographic conditions. The last three variables can be influenced by human land-uses. This study is concerned with the influence of landuse
types (categories) on infiltration at the upper
Ciliwung watershed of West-Java, Indonesia. Sixty six infiltration measurements were carried out in 5 types of land-uses i.e. natural forest, agriculture, settlement, productive (old) tea and new tea plantation areas. The measurements were done using ring infiltrometers. The data
obtained were expressed in the form of Philip's equation I = st1I2 + At, where I is cumulative infiltration; S is sorptivity; t is time; A is a parameter which was calculated from saturated hydraulic conductivity (K). Crown cover, slope gradient and soil variables such as soil moisture, organic carbon content, total porosity,
bulk density were also analysed from each of the 66 sites. The results of the study shows that land-use types have significant influence on these soil variables and on infiltration. Crown cover and human activities in term of land management are among the most important factors which affect soil condition. These variables mostly influence total porosity of soil which is the most important variable to determine sorptivity and hydraulic conductivity. High percentage of crown cover and less human activity
in forest area result in high accumulation of litter and humus and high total porosity of soil. On the other hand, settlement and new tea plantation areas have comparatively low crown cover and more frequent human activity which
result in soil compaction. Discriminant function analysis of land-use categories shows that the soil under forest is very distinct from the soils under other land-use types. However, the soils under the remaining land-use types are
more similar to each other, especially between the soil of settlement and tea plantations.
The rank of infiltration rate from the highest to the lowest magnitude is as follows; natural forest, agriculture, productive tea plantation, new tea plantation and settlement areas. Infiltration rates under natural forest and agriculture are significantly different from each
other as well as from those in the last three land- use types. However, there are no significant differences in infiltration rates among the last three land-use types. The result of this study also provides basic information
for landuse management and further research in
order to solve soil and water conservation and management problems in the watershed.</field><field name="date">1992</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">inflation</field><field name="subject">watershed</field><field name="subject">Indonesia</field><field name="subject">West Java</field><field name="subject">Upper Ciliwung</field><field name="subject">landuse</field><field name="subject">watershed management</field><field name="subject">soil variables</field><field name="subject">land management</field><field name="subject">hydrology</field><field name="subject">Philip's equation</field><field name="subject">soil conservation</field><field name="subject">water conservation. land-use</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20041215.124610</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Influencing the boss : correlates of upward influence strategies</field><field name="creator">Byrne, Ros</field><field name="description">The research reported in this thesis examines some aspects of upward influence behaviours at work, and in particular, the relationship between type of influence behaviours used and a number of potential correlates, including sex of agent, sex of target, sex-role identity, locus of control, job level, job type (secretarial worker or not) and educational level of agent.

To examine these relationships. 64 male and 173 female white-collar workers (at AS01 to AS06 levels, or equivalent) in three large organisations in Canberra (A.C.T.) were surveyed, with a questionnaire containing measures of influence behaviours, attitudes to influencing upwards at work, a measure of sex-role identity, and a measure of locus of control beliefs, as well as demographic information.

The data gathered from this survey was analysed using univariate, bivariate. and multivariate methods.

Results showed limited support for stereotypical differences between males and females in influence behaviours used, and no support for
hypotheses involving sex of target, sex-role identity, or secretarial workers.

Influence behaviours previously identified as having positive outcomes for the agent were found in this study to be significantly associated with job level and educational level; influence behaviours previously identified as having negative outcomes for the agent were significantly associated with the tendency to explain outcomes in terms of control by powerful others, and with a sex-role identity characterised by negative masculinity traits. These findings suggest the importance of both structural and personal factors in choice of upward influence strategies at work.

Many factors contribute to music improvisation skill and they must all be taken into account when investigating the music improvisation processes of high school music students. The theoretical framework of this study was based on the complex interactions that take place simultaneously between three identified ensembles of factors. The three ensembles of factors were: 
I . The student profile which included general information and detailed aspects of prior music experience.
2. Enabling skills which included audiation ability, the ability to play music by ear and kinaesthetic abilities.
3. Improvisation processes including, creative processes, cognitive strategies and group or solo contexts for music improvisation.

Taking into account the exploratory nature of this study, the single embedded case study design, involving 12 high school music instrumentalists aged between 13 and 15 years, offered the necessary potential to cope with the wide variety of evidence.

The formal survey was used to gather information that would establish a detailed profile of each student. The Test of Ability to Audiate and Ability to Play by Ear (TAAAPE) was used to measure students' ability to audiate and play music by ear. Similarly, in order to explore the relationships between improvisation processes,
enabling skills and the profile of each student, the Improvisation Ability Test (IAT) was used. This test provided authentic music improvisation experiences in both group and solo contexts. Both tests were scored by two independent judges and the researcher. Finally, the focused interview was used to establish the cognitive
strategies used by the students when undertaking the various music improvisation tasks.

The ability of the case study design to handle both qualitative and quantitative data
proved to be useful in this study. Two major findings emerged from the analysis of
the data:
1. The first was that the processes used by this small group of students when engaged in music improvisation were unpredictable.
2. The second major finding relates to evidence that supports the theory of an interaction between the three ensembles of factors as presented in the theoretical framework of this study. However, contrary to what might have been expected, the study further indicated that the interaction of these factors, in the context of
the music improvisation processes used by these individual students, did not follow or produce any specific patterns.

It was not within the scope of this study to seek the emergence of a model for teaching music improvisation to high school music instrumentalists. However, it has opened the path for further research which could result in the development of such a model.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">music improvisation processes</field><field name="subject">improvising music</field><field name="subject">schools</field><field name="subject">instrumentalists</field><field name="subject">TAAAPE</field><field name="subject">IAT</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20050214.143037</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Perceived needs of the terminally ill</field><field name="creator">Fulton, Graham</field><field name="description">While there is considerable international interest in the development of hospice and palliative care programs, as an alternative form of care for the terminally ill, there is minimal empirical research undertaken on the needs of recipients of these programs. Using a Q-sort, developed by the author, this research examined the relationship between individual patient's ranking of their needs, and the nurse's perception of the needs identified by individual
patients in their care.

A basic assumption of the study was that patients' needs could be categorised in four groups, namely spiritual, physical, emotional, and social. Consequently, the study also examined whether patients and nurses identified, as most important, needs from one group, more frequently than the other groups.

The limited size of the sample placed severe restrictions on the analysis of results derived from this research. However, while no definite conclusions could be drawn from data obtained from the small sample, tentative analysis identified trends that may have proved significant had they continued in a larger sample.</field><field name="date">1989</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">terminally ill</field><field name="subject">perceived needs</field><field name="subject">hospice</field><field name="subject">palliative care</field><field name="subject">patients</field><field name="subject">nurses</field><field name="subject">spiritual needs</field><field name="subject">physical needs</field><field name="subject">emotional needs</field><field name="subject">social needs</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20050217.103844</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Gender differences in multiple choice assessment</field><field name="creator">Geering, Margo</field><field name="description">Multiple choice testing has been introduced as an assessment instrument in almost all educational systems during the past twenty years. A growing body of research seems to indicate that tests structured to a multiple choice format favour males. In the ACT, Queensland and Western Australia, a
multiple choice examination known as ASAT was used to moderate student scores. Using data from the 1989 ASAT Paper 1, as well as data from the ACT Year 12 cohort of that year, an investigation was made of the items in the ASAT paper. This investigation attempted to identify specific types of questions that enabled males, on average, to perform better than females. Questions, which had a statistically significant difference between the results of males and
females, were examined further. An ASAT unit was given to students to complete and their answers to a questionnaire concerning the unit were taped and analysed.
The study found that males performed better, on average, than females on the 1989 ASAT Paper 1. The mean difference in the quantitative questions was much greater than in the verbal
questions. A number of factors appear to contribute to the difference in performance between males and females. A statistically significant number of females study Mathematics
at a lower level, which appears to contribute to females lower quantatitive scores. Females seem to be considerably more anxious about taking tests and this anxiety remains throughout
a multiple choice test. Females lack confidence in their ability to achieve in tests and are tentative about "risktaking" which is an element of multiple choice tests. The language of the test and male oriented content may contribute to females' negative performance in multiple choice testing.</field><field name="date">1993</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ASAT</field><field name="subject">multiple choice assessment</field><field name="subject">gender differences</field><field name="subject">Australian Scholastic Aptitude Test</field><field name="subject">males</field><field name="subject">females</field><field name="subject">performance</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20050218.141005</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An examination of a military performance appraisal system and the selection of commanders; perceived validity, prototypes and sources of error</field><field name="creator">Elsbury, O. James</field><field name="description">Performance appraisal has been well established as an important management tool for improving individual and organisational performance, and has attracted considerable research interest over the past fifty years. Many previous studies of performance appraisal have been conducted either in laboratory settings, or have tended
to focus narrowly on raters and/or the appraisal process, or of necessity have excluded from consideration the group dynamics prevalent in large organisations. Additionally, although it has long been recognised that the purpose of performance appraisal can affect ratings, little appears to have been done in situ on performance appraisal as a part of a complex personnel management system. One consequence of this approach has been a degree of uncertainty on the utility of laboratory and other findings to working appraisal systems. Moreover, previous examinations have focused on civilian
organisations even though military organisations have an equally long history of using performance appraisal for a range of purposes. Using a sample (N = 577) of senior air force officers from three adjacent rank levels, this study examined the relationships between performance appraisal rating leniency, the perceived causes of leniency, and two personnel selection processes based on appraisal data. Rating leniency was perceived to be widespread, and was found to be associated with a lack of confidence (or mistrust) in several aspects of the performance appraisal system and related officer selection processes. While officer groups did not show any practically significant
differences in perception of the prototype of the ideal commander (the leader), raters used a range of prototypes for estimating officers' promotion potential and suitability for command. Officers from one employment specialisation tended to stand apart in their view of the appraisal system and personnel selection processes, and the lower ranking officers surveyed tended to be more critical of the performance appraisal system and selection processes than were the higher ranking officers. In terms of selection process outcomes, 21.7% of officers were not satisfied with the management and leadership style of their commander, and officers at the lower organisational levels were found to be significantly (p&lt;.005) more satisfied with their commander that those at the highest level. Satisfaction was found to be predicted by a multiple regression equation (R2=.72, p&lt;.001), with the elements of the equation reinforcing the importance of a human-relations orientation for effective leaders. This study suggests that the behaviour of a working performance appraisal system can be predicted by established theory and that a model of system effectiveness may be possible, embracing rating errors, rating format, reliability factors (such as dyadic quality and period of observation), criterion validity of the appraisal instrument, and rater trust in the system. Additionally, this study suggests that upwards appraisal may be a useful input to the process for selecting leaders, if only to indicate which appraisal dimensions are perceived by subordinates to be important.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">performance appraisal</field><field name="subject">military performance</field><field name="subject">leadership styles</field><field name="subject">selection process</field><field name="subject">personnel management</field><field name="subject">Royal Australian Air Force</field><field name="subject">RAAF</field><field name="subject">Australian Defence Force</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20050307.155449</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Five yards, a cloud of dust and a bucket of blood : Australian rugby league and violence 1970 to 1995</field><field name="creator">Hutchins, Brett</field><field name="description">This thesis evaluates Australian rugby league participant violence between 1970 and 1995 through the use of figurational sociology, a body of thought pioneered by Norbert Elias. While figurational theory is the dominant
paradigm used, an interdisciplinary focus is adopted in order to negotiate the recognised weaknesses of 'Eliasian' theory, and to complement its strengths. Communication
studies, cultural studies and gender theory are interweaved with figurational sociology to analyse rugby league violence. Furthermore, through these theoretical paradigms, important wider social and cultural issues are taken into account including the commodification of
Australian rugby league, the media framing of State of Origin rugby league as a 'sports mediated product', and the role violence plays both within the construction of masculine identities in rugby league and in the wider 'gender order' . These social and cultural issues are evaluated to gain an adequate understanding of the structural and interpersonal interrelationships constituting the social phenomenon of rugby league violence. The central finding of this thesis is that there
is a processual shift from more to less illegitimate violence in Australian rugby league between 1970 and 1995.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australian rubgy league</field><field name="subject">violence</field><field name="subject">Norbert Elias</field><field name="subject">Eliasian theory</field><field name="subject">State of Origin</field><field name="subject">sporting violence</field><field name="subject">sociology</field><field name="subject">masculinity</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20050308.155200</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Case against India : British propaganda in the United States, 1942</field><field name="creator">Weigold, Auriol</field><field name="description">British propaganda, delivered in the United States against immediate self-government for India in 1942, was efficiently and effectively organised. British propaganda was not adventitious. It was deliberate. The chief protagonists were Churchill and Roosevelt. Churchill's success in retaining control of government in India depended on convincing the President that there was no viable alternative.

This the Prime Minister did in two ways. Firstly, his propaganda organization targetted pro-British groups in America with access to
Roosevelt. Secondly, it discredited Indian nationalist leadership.
 
Churchill's success also depended on Sir Stafford Cripps' loyalty to Whitehall and to the Government of India after his Mission in March 1942 failed to reach agreement with the Indian leaders. Cripps tailored his account of the breakdown of negotiations to fit the British propaganda line. Convincing American public opinion and, through it the President, that colonial government should remain in British hands, also depended on the right mix of censorship and press freedom in India.

Britain's need to mount a propaganda campaign in the United States indicated its dual agenda: its war-related determination to maintain and increase American aid, and its longer term aim to
retain control of its empire.

Despite strong American support for isolationism, given legal status in the 1930s Neutrality Acts, Roosevelt was Britain's supportive friend and its ally. Britain, nonetheless, felt sufficiently threatened by the anti-imperial thrust of the Lend Lease Act and
the Atlantic Charter, to develop propaganda to persuade the American public and its President that granting Indian selfgovernment in 1942 was inappropriate.

The case for a propaganda campaign was made stronger by Roosevelt's constant pressure on Britaln from mid-1941 to reach a political settlement with India. Pressure was also brought to bear by the Congress Party as the price for its war-related cooperation, by China, and by the Labour Party in Britain. Japan's success in
Singapore and Burma made strategists briefly assess that India might be the next target. Stable and cooperative government there was as much in America's interest as Britain's.

The idea that Roosevelt might intervene in India to secure a measure of self-government there constantly worried Churchill. In turn this motivated the Foreign Office, the Ministry of Information, the India Office, the Government of India and the British Embassy in Washington to develop propaganda based, firstly, on the official explanation for the failure of the Cripps Mission and, secondly. on the elements of the August 1942 Quit India resolution which could
be presented as damaging to allied war aims.

The perceived danger to Britain's India-related agenda, however, did not end with substantive threats. The volatility of the American press and the President's susceptibility to it in framing policy were more unpredictable. Britain met both threats by targetting friends with access to Roosevelt, sympathetic broadcasters and pro-British sections of the press. Each had
shown support for Britain during the Lend Lease debates.

Britain, however, could never assume that it had won the propaganda battle or that Roosevelt would not intervene polltically on nationalist India's behalf. Roosevelt continued during 1942
and beyond to let Indian leaders know of his interest in their struggle, and information received from his Mission in New Delhi and from unofficial informants in India gave him a view of events there which differed markedly from the British account. Just as nationalist India was unsure about America's intentions, so was

in telecommunications from the advent of telegraphy to Australia in 1854 to the
end of 2000, with particular emphasis on concepts of universal service.
The history of public policy development in telecommunications universal service
obligations is analysed to gain an understanding of how different narratives are
used to frame policy within particular material contexts. The study demonstrates
that narratives in telecommunication development reflect national public policy
agendas. In addition the thesis analyses how policy narratives are used to
underwrite and legitimise assumptions, values and statements that influence the
agendas and expectations of diverse social actors and interpretive communities.
Furthermore, the thesis examines the interaction between policy narratives and
the barriers and opportunities created by dynamic material environments such
as economic, legislative and technological arenas.
The study analyses five narratives that influence telecommunication policy and
the agendas and expectations of diverse social actors and interpretive
communities. National development, technocratic, rights, competition and charity
narratives are used to frame different approaches to telecommunication policy,
with particular reference to universal service. The study demonstrates how
national development and competition narratives compete to dominate policy.
Furthermore, diverse technocratic narratives provide scientific reinforcement to
underwrite and legitimise the dominant narrative as well as discredit alternative
perspectives. In addition, social rights and charity narratives respectively provide
moral support to underwrite and legitimise national development and competition
policy narratives.
A key focus of this study is a narrative analysis of more than a thousand
submissions to an independent inquiry in 2000 into telecommunication service
levels with particular reference to universal service. The Telecommunications
Service Inquiry was a forum that provided examples of the narratives analysed
in this study from a cross-section of the Australian community. Submissions
came from diverse social actors and institutions that included governments and
state bodies, the telecommunication industry, unions, the farming industry, other
business groups, community groups and individuals.
The research demonstrates that changes in material environments and social
expectations of universal service produce tensions within dominant narratives
that require greater support from secondary narratives to provide scientific and
moral legitimacy. Furthermore the research indicates that, in part, universal
service policy functions to stabilise and legitimise the dominant policy narrative.
However, the diverse social expectations associated with universal service
produce continuing tensions within the dominant narrative that keep the policy in
a state of flux. Consequently, government and industry policy makers find
telecommunications policy a problematic area to reconcile with expectations of
universal service.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">public policy</field><field name="subject">telecommunications</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">universal service</field><field name="subject">telecommunication development</field><field name="subject">policy narratives</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20050331.101440</field></doc><doc><field name="title">"What is the Environment Anyway"?: A Study of Children's Perceptions of the Notion of Environment</field><field name="creator">Carroll, Colleen</field><field name="description">This interpretive study focused on the way in which children

comprehensive examination of children's perceptions of the notion
of environment in an Australian context. There is a concerted effort
to create environmental education programs targeted for children
yet we have little understanding of how children make sense of
the concept of environment. The study examined perspectives from
children aged 11 to 13 living in close proximity in New South Wales,
Australia. Children's perspectives were gathered through a drawing
activity as well as small group interviews. In order to provide a larger
conceptual picture of children's perceptions data was also gathered
from the surrounding community. Parents, teachers, principals
and local media's perspectives on the notion of environment
were investigated. The study showed that children perceive the
environment as nearly synonymous with nature. They also perceive
the environment and nature to be a place without people. Children
were very concerned about environmental issues, especially issues
in their local areas. Children generally did not attribute individuals
with responsibility for the environment. Children's ideas were
examined alongside those from the broader community revealing
relationships and links between community practices and children's
perceptions of the environment. This study addresses a gap in the
literature by providing a comprehensive exploration of children's
perceptions of the notion of the environment and examining links
to the portrayal of environment in the context of the surrounding

the colonisation of the Shoalhaven and Illawarra regions of New South Wales. It
explores the competing claims of articulation theory and dependency theory about the
intersection of colonial and indigenous economies. Dependency theory claims that
settlers destroy the indigenous mode of production to permit the expansion of their own
economic system. They exploit indigenous labour which then becomes dependent on
capitalist sources of subsistence. Articulation theory, as modified by Layton (2001) to
recognise the bi-directional nature of contact, posits that the rate of capitalist penetration
into indigenous economies is variable and that the non-capitalist mode of production may
be preserved to create a self-supporting source of labour. The contrasting theories are
assessed in this thesis by determining the contribution different strategies made to
Aboriginal subsistence. Historical evidence is used to assess each strategy. The main
source of information is from Alexander Berry's Shoalhaven estate, where Aboriginal
people lived from settlement in 1822 until they were moved to a reserve in the early
1900s. The analysis suggests that contrary to previous research, Aboriginal people
gained the majority of their subsistence from fishing, hunting and gathering until 1860.
Strategies that depended on the colonial economy such as farm work, trading, living with
settlers and stealing made only minor contributions to Aboriginal subsistence. After
1860, European land use intensified and Aboriginal people were further alienated from
the land. The contribution of hunting and gathering contracted as a result. Dependency
on government assistance increased, particularly after the foundation of the Aborigines
Protection Board in 1882. Fishing remained an important source of food and cash.
Maritime resources were not commercially exploited to a significant extent until the
closing years of the 19th century when Aboriginal people were provided with boats and
nets to assist their efforts. The historical evidence demonstrates that articulation theory
offers a more realistic approach than does dependency theory when analysing the
intersection of colonial and indigenous economies. This is because articulation theory

dysfunctional eating on female distance runners</field><field name="creator">Clews, Gayelene</field><field name="description">This study examined the effectiveness of a multi-dimensional education program in facilitating
attitude changes in adolescent female athletes away from dysfunctional eating behaviours and
restrictive body image. Although research is available for diagnosing and identifying the
problems associated with dysfunctional eating behaviours and attitudes in female athletes, few
preventative tools have been proposed in order to address the problem. This study involved the
design, delivery and the evaluation of a proposed a multi-dimensional education model as a
preventative tool. The research design involved 18 teenage female middle/long distance runners,
aged between 13 and 19, who were registered with the ACT Cross Country Club. The study was
a quantitative and qualitative investigation employing a pre and post test design and using the
process of triangulation to increase the study's validity. It was proposed that a multi-dimensional
education program might be effective in steering attitudes away from dysfunctional eating
behaviours and body image and that a mixed method design may corroborate and elaborate on
the findings of the study to strengthen the understanding of the potential benefits of such an
education program has to its participants. Results showed that education proved to be a
successful tool in facilitating attitudinal changes in a positive direction, across a number of

and pedagogic choice: Riverside's
response to the challenge</field><field name="creator">Faulkner, Val</field><field name="description">This study looks at the ways in which middle schooling initiatives (particularly notions
such as 'authentic pedagogy') are impacting on teachers' pedagogic choices and
practices especially in the area of literacy teaching. There has been no research to
date which explores the linkages between curriculum/school reform such as proposed
in middle schooling initiatives and choices/practices demonstrated by teachers caught
up in this initiative in particular schools. My research attempts to theorise the
connection between crucial features of middle school reform, teacher decisions and
practices in the classroom and their impact on students' own learning/adolescent
literacies. I assume that if the reform is to have continuity and to contribute to higher
levels of adolescent engagement and deep learning, it needs to support and facilitate
certain kinds of decisions and practices in the school and classroom environments.
Where I find evidence of engagement, sustained/substantial conversation across
lessons, within lessons and 'deep learning' in transdisciplinary work by students, then it
is fair to say that middle schooling is working for students and teachers. Where I find
little or no evidence of these things, then it is necessary to apply a critical and
constructive reading of reform initiatives. This critical and constructive reading
attempts to outline the necessary and sufficient conditions which must be in place in
schools if middle schooling is to thrive and to make the difference in young peoples'
school lives it claims to make. My research is a contribution to the sustained and
substantial conversation that is so necessary to middle schooling reform.
Many previous studies surrounding middle schooling have remained at the level of
"description". These commentaries either support or oppose the reform initiative. In
making a commitment to move beyond description, generated by participant
observation and ethnographic conversations, to also involve extensive D/discourse
analysis (Gee, 1999; Bernstein, 1990) of pedagogic practice, this thesis sought to
develop an awareness of the notion of authentic literacy pedagogy through close
analysis of pedagogic choice enacted in three middle school homerooms. A further
significance lies in the perspectives that it offers on adolescent literacies.
The data collected raised questions about the "actual" impact of the middle school
reform initiative at one school, Riverside', how this approach to schooling for young
adolescents impacts on the way that teachers and students construct literacies; and
whether or not these constructions are mindful of the range of those "private" and
"public" literacies found in the multiple life-worlds of adolescents (Phelps, 1998). It
challenges some "myths" about literacy pedagogic transformation linked to middle
schooling, as well as, highlights those factors, both physical and intrinsic, that impact
on reform initiatives and change.
Acknowledgement of the need to engage in a theorisation of adolescent literacies that
moves beyond the current narrow macro-level D/discourse agenda, which focuses on
the "public" school-based literacies, also emerged. This highlights those tensions that
exist between the macro, meso and micro educational environments when considering
what it means to be "literate" for young adolescents.

The study also highlights those disjunctions and tensions found within the progressivist
middle school approach. As a result there are a number of implications that emerge.
These are linked to the preparation of pre-service teachers; a concern for the
physical/material landscape of middle schools; the establishment of Learning Circles as
critical in creating the "ferment of change"; the need to continue theorising the notion -
adolescent literacies; the need to link professional learning for teachers to those
phases of pedagogic change highlighted as part of the reform process; as well as an
acknowledgement of the importance of the need to support the development of more
authentic pedagogies.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">education</field><field name="subject">middle schooling</field><field name="subject">Riverside School</field><field name="subject">literacy</field><field name="subject">adolescence</field><field name="subject">pedagogy</field><field name="subject">Learning Circles</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20050411.094459</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The ecology and management of the common brushtail possum Trichosurus vulpecula in Central Australia.</field><field name="creator">Foulkes, Jeffery Neil</field><field name="description">This study investigates the ecology of one of the best known Australian marsupials,
the Common Brushtail Possum Trichosurus vulpecula, in central Australia. Trichosurus
vulpecula is one of few medium-sized mammal species that persist in arid Australia today.
Its distribution within the arid zone has declined markedly since European settlement. Two
populations, one within the East MacDonnell Ranges along the Hale River and the other on
Irving Creek, a River Red Gum creek in the Petermann Ranges, were studied in the southern
Northern Territory. Others locations in the region were visited opportunistically. Trie
central Australian Trichosurus is not distinct genetically from populations elsewhere in
Australia.
The diet of T. vulpecula consisted of a range of leaves, flowers and fruits of perennial
dicotyledonous species as well as some ephemeral herbs. Grasses were absent from the diet.
Variation in the diet reflected seasonal availability in flowers and fruits. The species
preferentially consumed at each site had significantly higher moisture content and dry matter
digestibility than species not consumed. Preferred species included Amyema maidenii leaves
(a mistletoe), Acacia spp. flowers and fruits, Santalum lanceolatum leaves (a shrub),
Marsdenia australis leaves (a vine), Solarium quadriloculatum fruit (shrub) and Euphorbia
spp. leaves (herb). Small amounts of invertebrate material were consumed throughout the
year. Other non-plant material consumed included honeycomb and unfledged birds eg.
Budgerigars. There were no significant differences in the diet between the sexes.
Trichosurus vulpecula were found in six main habitats: Acacia aneura/Callitris
glaucophylla on rocky hills; E. camaldulensis sandy creek-lines; mixed Acacia rocky hills,
Rocky Eucalyptus creek-lines; Degraded drainage lines; and Wet gullies. Logistic regression
modelling revealed a significant correlation between mistletoe species richness, higher levels
of soil nitrogen and the presence of T. vulpecula. In habitats occupied by T. vulpecula
species richness of mistletoes was associated with the absence of fire and the presence of
reliable ground water supplies.
Trichosurus vulpecula were highly mobile with mean home ranges at Hale River of
44.21 &#65533; 22.76 ha and considerably higher than those recorded in previous studies in
Australia. Mean home ranges at Irving Creek were much smaller, at 4.99 &#65533; 1.46 ha and
VII
similar to that recorded in other studies in Australia. At both sites, males had larger home
ranges and there was a high degree of overlap with other males and females. At the Hale
River study site, T. vulpecula predominantly denned in caves or cavities in rocks, whereas at
Irving Creek all den sites were in large Eucalyptus camaldulensis on the drainage line. Adult
and pouch young sex ratios were at parity. During this study, T. vulpecula was found to
breed continuously, with births recorded in almost all months. Growth of the young were
more rapid than previously recorded for Trichosurus in Australia. This is interpreted as an
adaptation for living in an arid environment, enabling the young to achieve independence
before quality food supplies diminish.
No single exotic predator or competitor was solely responsible for the decline of T.
vulpecula in arid Australia, implying an interactive impact. Prey switching by dingoes from
rabbits to T. vulpecula, macropods and echidnas followed the crash of rabbit populations at
Hale River. Predation by dingoes on T. vulpecula was only recorded once, at the Irving
Creek study site, where numbers of rabbits remained stable throughout the study. The
impact of exotic herbivores occurred through habitat degradation rather than competition.
Evaluation of the ecological data collected during this study generally supports
current models of decline and extinction in medium-sized mammals in arid Australia,
integrating the effects of predators, competitors, drought and fire. However, the importance
of each factor on populations of T. vulpecula was found to vary depending on their location
in the landscape. This study suggests two separate models to explain the decline of T.
vulpecula in arid Australia after the arrival of Europeans. The first operates in the riparian
lowlands and the second on the rocky ranges. In both models, prior to European settlement,
T. vulpecula occupied refuge habitats characterised by readily available moisture for plant
growth (run on areas and/or shallow water tables) and soils with higher soil nutrient
concentrations. The impact of fires on these refugia was minimal, as Aboriginal burning
practices protected them with mosaic burning generally preventing large-scale fires from
developing. Following European settlement, the forces impacting on populations were
different in the riparian lowlands from those affecting rocky ranges.
In the riparian lowlands, the effects of rabbits and livestock together with predation
were found to have the major impact on T. vulpecula populations. Fire was not a significant
factor in these areas.
In the rocky ranges, fire was the most significant factor affecting T. vulpecula
populations. Introduced herbivores did not degrade these habitats as they did in the riparian
lowlands because the rugged and steep nature of the ranges acted as a physical barrier.
Similarly, predator numbers were lower because of the relative difficulty in moving over
rough ground and the generally lower relative abundance of preferred prey such as rabbits.
An adaptive management strategy needs to be implemented to determine the
effects of different management regimes on T. vulpecula population viability. The key
elements of a management strategy in the riparian lowlands involves the manipulation and
monitoring of predators, rabbits and livestock numbers. In the rocky ranges, the key
management strategy involves the implementation of a patch burning to prevent fires entering
habitats occupied by T. vulpecula. Importantly, any management strategies should involve
Aboriginal people. Trichosurus vulpecula is an important part of Aboriginal culture. Its
decline is of great concern to many people and several of the remaining populations and
potential reintroduction locations are on Aboriginal land. Because of their relationship with
the land and the animals, people have both the knowledge of the animal and the skills (such
as patch burning) to provide information to managers which will assist with management.
To achieve these management directions a coordinated national education programme
is required to inform and convince the Australian community that conservation of T. vulpecula
is deserving of attention in arid and semi-arid Australia. This is particularly important given
the perception that T. vulpecula is a common species throughout Australia, despite its massive
decline in arid Australia since European settlement.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Common brushtail possum</field><field name="subject">Trichosurus vulpecula</field><field name="subject">central Australia</field><field name="subject">ecology</field><field name="subject">Petermann Ranges</field><field name="subject">East MacDonnell Ranges</field><field name="subject">riparian lowlands</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20050411.101222</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Information technology implementation and acceptance: a case study of change management</field><field name="creator">Compton, Shane M.</field><field name="description">The implementation of a new Information Technology in an organization represents a
significant change. Little research, however, has been conducted on the collective
power of Information Technology acceptance and change management. The current
research seeks to integrate a prominent model of technology acceptance and change
management theory to develop an holistic approach to Information Technology
implementation and acceptance. Using Davis' (1989) Technology Acceptance Model
(TAM) (Attitude) and Beer, Eisenstat and Specter's (1990) six step model of change
(Change), this three phase longitudinal case study examined the change management
of the implementation of a new Information System within a statutory authority.
Results from the current study show that the addition of the six step model (Change)
adds appreciably to the TAM (Attitude) in the prediction of general service
satisfaction and perceived implementation success. Findings also show the temporal
salience of the factors of the six step model and the TAM in the prediction of these
dependent variables. The current research supports previous work by Davis (1989)
and Thompson, Higgins and Howell (1994) who stated that initially people are
motivated to use an Information System by affect, but will in time be more concerned
with usefulness as habit formation occurs. The current study found that during the
pre-implementation phase, commitment through communication and vision are
critical to the change process. However, as the change moves into the implementation
phase, consensus becomes most important. The shift in factors salient during the
change process is what the author refers to as the temporal progression proposition.

determination of the pig-nosed
turtle, Carettochelys insculpta, in
the wet-dry tropics of Australia</field><field name="creator">Doody, J. Sean</field><field name="description">Much of what we know about temperature-dependent sex determination
(TSD) in reptiles stems from constant temperature incubation studies in the
laboratory. In recent years, as TSD studies moved into the field it became evident
that TSD was much more complex than previously thought. The present study
attempted to reveal the complexity of TSD, as it relates to other features of the
species' biology and physical characteristics tractable only in the field, such as
fluctuations in incubation temperature and reproductive life history. To this end I
studied the ecology of the turtle Carettochelys insculpta, a TSD species inhabiting the
wet-dry tropics of northern Australia from 1996 to 1998. I tested hypotheses
associated with movements, activity, behaviour, reproduction, nest site choice, nest
temperatures, embryonic survival, embryonic aestivation, hatch-ling sex ratios, and
emergence in the species. Each of these was also considered in the context of the
influence of the wet-dry tropics.
Compared to other turtles inhabiting lotic habitats, C. insculpta occupied
considerably larger home ranges, covering up to 10 km of river. Of previously
published factors influencing home range size, low productivity of the (micro) habitat
may best explain the extensive home ranges in C. insculpta. Patchiness and low
nutrient value of the chief food (aquatic vegetation) of C. insculpta may force turtles
to cover large expanses of river to acquire sufficient energy for growth and
reproduction. Females were more active, moved farther, and occupied larger home
ranges than males. Home ranges of females comprised 1-4 activity centres, many of
which were associated with thermal springs. I suggest that females may exhibit
increased activity and movements relative to males because of sexual inequality in
parental investment, where food is particularly limiting (e.g., in species with biennial
reproduction). Biennial reproduction in the population allowed the examination of the
influence of reproductive condition on home range size, movements, and activity.
Reproductive condition did not influence home range or activity, but gravid turtles
moved father between successive sightings than non-gravid females. Individual data
corroborate these findings, with females moving farther between successive sightings
while gravid compared to while spent. Contrary to previous reports, turtles did not
appear to move into estuarine areas or lowland flood plains during the wet season, but
moved into the riparian forest and possibly into wetlands adjacent to the main channel
in the vicinity of their dry season home ranges.
During the study I documented the turtles' use of small, localized thermal
springs discharging from the river bottom. Dataloggers attached to the carapace to
monitor ambient water temperatures recorded the frequency and duration of thermal
spring use by individuals. Turtles used the thermal springs frequently during the
winter (4-6 months) when river temperatures were lower than that of the thermal
springs (8 = 29 &#65533; 0.52&#65533; C). Turtles often utilized thermal springs for several
consecutive hours, leaving the springs only to surface for air. Thermal springs may be
derived from ground water (which maintains a temperature equivalent to the annual
mean air temperature), rather than from a specific geothermal heat source. Nine of 19
radio-telemetered adult females were seen to use thermal springs, of which seven
were gravid and two non-gravid. Thus, gravid turtles may seek thermal springs more
than non-gravid turtles. Frequency, duration, and timing of usage collectively suggest
active thermoregulation as the primary function of thermal spring use. Utilization of
thermal springs probably permits turtles to be more active in cooler months, which
may enhance growth rates and accumulation of energy for reproduction. Onset of
nesting along river stretches with thermal springs preceded nesting in a stretch not
known to have thermal springs by 24 days. Thus, I speculate that by warming
themselves on thermal springs in the months prior to nesting, turtles may have
accelerated follicular development and nested earlier.
Female C. insculpta matured at ca. 6 kg body mass (38.0 cm carapace length,
30.5 cm plastron length). Turtles produced egg sizes and clutch sizes similar to that
of other turtle species of similar size. Turtles reproduced every second year, but
produced two clutches in each breeding year, ca. 40 days apart. Thus, it appeared that
females were energy limited, possibly due to the low available energy content of the
dry season diet (aquatic vegetation). Life history theory predicts that if some costly
behaviour is associated with reproduction, skipping years could reduce that cost and
allow savings to be directed into future reproduction. The present study revealed no
obvious accessory behaviour in the population. Within years, clutch mass did not
differ between early (first) and late (second) clutches. However, earlier clutches
tended to have more and smaller eggs per clutch but than later clutches, a new finding
for turtles that has been demonstrated in lizards and other animals. Because the study
spanned both years with 'big' and 'small' wet seasons, I was able to examine how the
magnitude of the wet season influenced reproductive characteristics. Following big
wet seasons turtles produced larger, heavier, and more eggs per clutch than they did
after small wet seasons. Relationships among body size, egg size, and clutch size
were evident after two big wet seasons but not apparent after two small wet seasons.
Collectively, annual variation in reproductive characteristics and current life history
theory suggest that a big wet season is a plentiful time for the turtles.
I investigated beach selection of nesting pig-nosed turtles (Carettochelys
insculpta) along a 63 km stretch of river in 1997 and 1998. I used three classes of
beaches to examine beach choice: beaches with nests, beaches with only crawls, andbeaches without nests or crawls. Across these beach types I compared aspect, solar
exposure, temperature, substrate moisture, height, water depth at approach, and the
height of cohesive sand. I located 82 nesting beaches with 221 nests, and identified
171 potential nesting beaches based on previously published criteria. Beaches with
nests had a greater substrate moisture content and corresponding higher cohesive sand
line (hereafter CSL) than beaches without nests. Beaches with nests also had a higher
CSL than beaches with only crawls. Apparently, turtles could not excavate a nest
chamber above the CSL due to loose substrate consistency causing sand to fall in on
itself. Turtles could only nest at low elevations below the CSL on beaches with lower
substrate moisture. Turtles apparently avoided nesting on these beaches due to the
higher probability of nest flooding, as corroborated by a concurrent study. Beach
temperatures increased with a seasonal increase in air temperatures, and were
influenced by aspect and total angle of solar exposure. Temperatures did not differ
among beaches with nests, beaches with only crawls, and beaches without crawls or
nests. Therefore, there was no indication that turtles were manipulating offspring sex
through choice of nesting beach. However, turtles may be manipulating sex by
nesting in areas with particular thermal characteristics within beaches.
Two related aspects of hatchling emergence were studied. Using emergence
phenology data, nest temperatures, historical weather data, and a developmental
model, I tested the hypothesis that delayed hatching occurred in C. insculpta, and that
such a delay would allow hatchlings to time their emergence to match the onset of the
wet season. Hatchling C. insculpta emerged, on average, 17 days later than dates
predicted from a developmental model. Combined with observations of hatchlings
remaining in eggs until emergence, these results confirmed delayed hatching in
nature. This delay was synchronized with initial river rises associated with the onsetof wet season rains, and is consistent with published criteria for embryonic
aestivation. On a diel scale, I generated predictions of two potentially competing
models for nocturnal emergence in hatchling turtles, based on the knowledge that air
temperatures decrease with season during the emergence period. A test of those
predictions for C. insculpta produced ambiguous results. However, further analysis
indicated that C. insculpta, and probably other nocturnally emerging turtle species,
respond to a decline in diel temperature rather than an absolute temperature. The
former would ensure nocturnal emergence, while the latter is experienced during the
day as well as at night. Nocturnal emergence may be associated with nesting in open
microhabitats.
The 'decision' of when and where to nest can influence both offspring survival
and hatchling sex ratios in animals with temperature-dependent sex determination
(TSD). Knowledge of how these maternal attributes influence the incubation
environment is an important first step in hypothesizing why TSD evolved in a
particular species. 1 studied the influence of nest site choice and timing of nesting on
embryonic survival and hatchling sex ratios. Predation and flooding were the major
sources of embryonic mortality. Embryonic survival was influenced by both lay date
and nest site choice: In one year when nesting began later, nests laid later and at lower
elevations were destroyed by early wet season river rises. In other years early nesting
precluded flood mortality. However, turtles did not nest at the highest available
elevations. I hypothesized that turtles were unable to nest at higher elevations
because the sand was dry and not cohesive. A field experiment demonstrated that
turtles were constrained to nest at lower elevations where they could construct a nest
chamber. A mathematical model predicting hatchling sex from fluctuating
temperatures was applied to temperature data from 102 natural nests. Resultsconfirmed a type la pattern of TSD, whereby males are produced from cooler
temperatures and females from warmer temperatures. The principal determinant of
hatchling sex was lay date. Clutches laid earlier in the season produced mainly males,
while later clutches yielded mostly females, due to seasonal ramping of air and sand
temperatures. However, nest site choice also exerted an influence on hatchling sex.
Female-producing clutches were deposited at higher elevations than male-producing
clutches. The onset of nesting was not influenced by water temperatures, but may
have been related to the magnitude of the previous wet season(s). Turtles nested
earlier after two 'big' wet seasons and later following two 'small' wet seasons. This
pattern indicates that the wet season is a plentiful time for the turtles. Adaptive
'differential fitness' models for the evolution of TSD have recently been reviewed and
clarified. The differential fitness model that best fits C. insculpta is the 'timematching'
model, whereby one sex benefits more than the other from early hatching.
Male C. insculpta hatched 2-3 weeks earlier then females, on average. Benefit to
early hatching males and, therefore, the ultimate selective mechanism (e.g., growth,
time to mature) is unknown. Obtaining such data will likely prove difficult in such a
long-lived species.
A recent adaptive explanation for the evolution and maintenance of temperaturedependent
sex determination (TSD) in reptiles rests upon the assumption that mothers
can predict or manipulate offspring sex. I postulated that four physiological and
behavioural criteria must be met in order for this assumption to be valid: (1) a strong
correlation must exist between substrate temperatures during nest site choice and nest
temperatures during the period of development when sex is determined in the egg
(thermosensitive period = TSP). (2) Assuming that (1) is possible, mothers would need
to be capable of correcting for temporal factors obscuring the predictable thermalcharacteristics of nest sites. This could be accomplished in two ways. By contracting
nesting times mothers could assess the relative temperatures of alternate nest sites with
some accuracy. A protracted distribution of nesting times could greatly reduce a
mother's ability to distinguish between, for example, a cooler nest site at a warmer
time and a warmer nest site at a cooler time. Alternatively, mothers would need to be
able to incorporate temporal changes in nest site temperatures. (3) Sufficient variation
in thermal profiles among nest sites, relative to the breadth of temperatures producing
both sexes (pivotal temperatures), would be necessary. For example, if most nests
produced both sexes, then depth of the eggs would be the deciding factor determining
sex, leaving little opportunity for nest site choice to produce one sex or the other. (4)
Mothers would need access to nest sites spanning a range of thermal profiles in order
to produce either offspring sex. To this end, home range size relative to the number
and location of nesting beaches should be important. I tested these four predictions in
Carettochelys insculpta, a beach nesting turtle with TSD, using three years of field
data on nest site choice, nesting times, thermal characteristics of nests, hatchling sex
ratios, and movements of nesting turtles. A strong positive correlation existed between
assessable substrate temperatures at nest site choice and mean daily TSP temperatures
in all three years. However, the proportion of explained variation was highly variable
among years, and low in 1998. Accordingly, the proportion of nests in which substrate
temperatures at nest site choice predicted offspring sex correctly was low in 1998 (48-
62 %, depending on treatment of the data). Nesting times were normally distributed,
and combined with diel changes in nest site temperatures greatly reduce a turtle's
ability to distinguish between sites that would produce different sexes. Considerable
among-clutch variation in thermal profiles to produce variable sex ratios existed,
agreeing with other studies on turtles. Radiotelemetry indicated that home rangesencompassed several nesting beaches with differing thermal profiles, indicating scope
for producing the desired sex. However, the seasonal increase in air temperatures
resulted in an overriding effect of mostly males being produced in early (first) clutches
and mainly females being produced in late (second) clutches. Collectively, the results
suggest that C. insculpta mothers would find it difficult to predict, and therefore,
manipulate hatchling sex, supporting the conventional notion that TSD mothers have
little or no control over offspring sex.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">pig-nosed turtle</field><field name="subject">sex determination in animals</field><field name="subject">applied biological science</field><field name="subject">Carettochelys insculpta</field><field name="subject">temperature-dependent sex determination</field><field name="subject">reptiles</field><field name="subject">wet-dry tropics</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20050404.101052</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Influence of fluvial geomorphology on
riparian vegetation in upland river valleys: south eastern Australia</field><field name="creator">Evans, Lisa J</field><field name="description">Healthy riparian vegetation has a positive impact on the adjacent river. Unfortunately,
riparian vegetation is often threatened by human impacts such as dam construction and
clearing. To gain the knowledge underlying the effects of such impacts and to aid riparian
rehabilitation, the objective of this thesis was: to determine riparian vegetation association
with, and response to, variation in fluvial geomorphology over several scales and
consequently to fluvial disturbance. Only woody riparian plant species were considered.
Flood disturbance was the unifying theme of this thesis. Linked to this theme and arising
from the main objective was the supposition that plant interactions with the abiotic
environment, but not biotic interactions between species, control riparian species distribution
because of frequent fluvial disturbances.
Woody riparian vegetation and riverine environmental variables were recorded along the
upper Murrumbidgee River at three spatial scales based on a geomorphic hierarchy for
Chapter 2. Multivariate analysis was used to group species and to associate environmental
variables with vegetation at the three spatial scales. Observations at the two larger scales, of
river segment (site) and riparian reach (transect), identified a river-longitudinal speciescomposition
gradient associated with geology, river width and stream channel slope.
Observations at the smallest scale of geomorphic units (plot) identified a lateral riparian
gradient and also the longitudinal gradient; these gradients were associated with geomorphic
variation, land use, plot elevation and also river longitudinal variables.
Using the same data set, but varying the spatial scale of analysis caused the species
composition pattern to change between scales. Increase in scale of observation, that is from
geomorphic unit to reach and segment scales, resulted in disproportionate importance of rarer
species and decreased importance of some key riparian species at the larger scales. It would
appear that in this instance the geomorphic unit scale best described patches of different
species composition because this scale had high spatial resolution and was also able to
identify multiple gradients of environmental variation. It was recommended that riparian
sampling take place at scales that represent dominant gradients in the riparian zone. These
gradients are represented by geomorphic scales, indicating the appropriateness of using
geomorphic based scales for observation of riparian vegetation. Chapter 3 considered whether there is a geomorphic template upon which riparian vegetation
is patterned and whether it is associated with process variables, such as flooding and soil type.
This question was investigated at different spatial scales in three ways: i) by an experiment to
determine whether soil nutrient condition affects plant growth; ii) by graphical analysis of
trends between geomorphic units, species and process variables; and iii) by analysis of
vegetation distribution data.
The smallest scale (meso) found experimental differences in plant growth because of soil
type. Plants growing in sand had the lowest performance, with an average plant Relative
Growth Rate (RGR) of 0.01, compared to plants growing in soils with small amounts of silt or
clay particles, with an average plant RGR of 0.04. This pattern was attributed to differences
in nutrients. Clear relationships were demonstrated at the larger geomorphic unit scale
between species distribution and process variables. For example, hydrology and substratum
type were found to be associated with geomorphic units and species. The largest scale
considered in Chapter 3 was the riparian reach scale. At this scale species were clearly
grouped around reach type. Therefore, geomorphology was considered to be a template for
riparian species distribution. Findings in this chapter suggested that geomorphic variables
should be good predictors of riparian species distribution. This hypothesis was tested and
supported in Chapter 6.
The experiments reported in Chapter 4 aimed to determine whether inundation depth and
duration affected plant performance and survival for five common riparian zone species.
Riparian seedling patterns in the field were also compared with experimental results to test
whether species performance was reflected by field distribution. The experiments that were
conducted included an inundation period and depth experiment, and a survival period test
whilst under complete inundation. Biomass and height relative growth rates were determined,
and the results were analysed using factorial Analysis of Variance. Obligate riparian species
(Callistemon sieberi, Casuarina Cunninghamiana, Leptospermum obovatum) were found to
be tolerant of inundation duration and depth, to the point where inundation provided a growth
subsidy. On the other hand, non-obligate riparian species (Acacia dealbata,
Kunzea ericoides) were either just tolerant of inundation or showed a negative growth
response. For instance, C. sieberi demonstrated an average height RGR of 0.04 after
complete inundation and 0.007 when not inundated, while A. dealbata had an average height
RGR of 0.001 after complete inundation and 0.01 when not inundated. These experimental
findings were found to closely reflect both seedling and adult plant distribution in the field
such that inundation tolerant species were found close to the river and intolerant species
further away. Thus, the conclusion was drawn that riparian species establishment and
distribution is affected by inundation and that change to the flood regime could have serious
impacts on riparian zone plant composition.
The other aim of this chapter was to determine whether optimum germination temperatures
were associated with flood or rainfall. Growth chamber germination trials were conducted at
air temperatures of 15&#65533;C, 20&#65533;C and 25&#65533;C to determine the 'best' germination temperature.
These germination patterns at different temperatures were then related to annual variation in
field temperature, flooding period and rainfall. No evidence was found to suggest a
relationship between ideal germination temperature and flood season, rather it was suggested
that germination was patchy through time and may simply reflect recent rainfall.
Investigations that were reported in Chapter 5 aimed to elucidate relationships between
species and flow velocity variables. Two experiments were conducted: i) a flume experiment
to determine the effect of flow velocity on plant growth; and ii) an experiment to observe the
response of plants to damage (imitating flood damage) and inundation. Field observations of
species distribution and flow velocity related variables were also conducted to put the flume
results into a real-world context.
Treatments for the flume experiment were fast flow velocity (0.74 m s-1), slow velocity
(0.22 m s-1) and no velocity (control) but still inundated. All treatments were flooded
completely for four days. Subsequent biomass and height relative growth rates were
determined, and the results were analysed using factorial Analysis of Variance. Results were
unexpected, given that obligate species exposed to the fastest velocity had the highest growth
rate with an average height RGR of 0.046, compared to plants in still water, which grew the
least with an average height RGR of 0.013. It was hypothesised that this response was
because relatively greater carbon dioxide and oxygen levels were available in the moving
water compared to the still water. With regard to shoot damage, the species that were nonobligate
riparian species lost more leaves from velocity treatment than the obligate riparian
species. The cut and flood experiment found growth of the obligate species
(Casuarina cunninghamiana) to be greater after cutting than the non-obligate species.
Flooding was not found to have an effect in the cut and flood experiment, probably because
the period to sampling after flood treatment was longer (4 weeks) than other flooding
experiments (3 weeks).
Field observations were found to support the experimental findings, with a gradient of species
across the riparian zone that reflected potential flood velocities. Therefore, velocity is one of
a suite of riparian hydrological factors that are partially responsible for the gradient of species
across the riparian zone. Potentially the absence of flooding could result in a homogeneous
mix of species, rather than a gradient, except on the very edge of the river.
The study that was reported in Chapter 6 investigated a technique for predicting riparian
vegetation distribution. One of the aims of this investigation was to address a current riparian
rehabilitation shortfall, which was how to objectively select species to plant for rehabilitation.
Field data were collected from three confined river valleys in south-eastern New South Wales.
Using data on plant species occurrence and site and plot measures of soils, hydrology and
climate, an AUSRIVAS-style statistical model, based on cluster and discriminant analysis,
was developed to predict the probability of species occurrence. The prediction accuracy was
85 % when tested with a separate set of plots not used in model construction. Problems were
encountered with the prediction of rarer species, but if the probability of selection was varied
according to the frequency of species occurrence then rarer species would be predicted more
often. Various models were tested for accuracy including three rivers combined at the
geomorphic unit (plot) scale and riparian reach (transect) scale in addition to a Murrumbidgee
River plot scale model. Surprisingly, the predictive accuracy of the all rivers and single river
models were approximately the same. However, the difference between the large scale and
small scale models pointed to the importance of including small scale flood-related
parameters to predict riparian vegetation.
When these riparian predictions were compared to predictive outcomes from a hill slope
model, which was assumed to be affected by fewer disturbances (i.e. flooding), predictive
accuracies were not very different. Overall though, predictive accuracy for riparian
vegetation was high, but not good enough to support the supposition that riparian vegetation is
abiotically controlled because of frequent flood disturbance. Nevertheless, geomorphology
and consequently flood effects are still important for the determination of the riparian
community composition.
Overall, riparian vegetation was found to be closely linked to its environment (evidenced in
Chapters 2, 3, 4, 5) in a predictable manner (Chapter 6). Species pattern relied on flood
disturbance affecting species distribution. Some riparian species were found to be highly tolerant of flooding and gained a growth advantage after flooding (Chapters 4 and 5).
Therefore, flood tolerance was important for the formation of a species gradient across the
riparian zone. These species tolerances and growth requirements reflect riparian geomorphic
pattern (Chapter 3), which was suggested to form a template on which riparian vegetation is
structured.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">riparian vegetation</field><field name="subject">fluvial geomorphology</field><field name="subject">upland river valley ecosystems</field><field name="subject">south eastern Australia</field><field name="subject">environmental impact</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20050404.112525</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of carp (Cyprinus carpio L) size in the
degradation of freshwater ecosystems.</field><field name="creator">Driver, Patrick</field><field name="description">Carp (Cyprinus carpio) are alien freshwater fish that are globally widespread and often
associated with highly degraded freshwater ecosystems. This study explored carphabitat
interactions that could contribute to the worldwide distribution of, and
consequent ecological impacts by, carp. Particular emphasis was placed on the role of
carp size in these interactions. One component of this study involved a field experiment
that was used to quantify the effects of carp biomass density and size-structure on
freshwater invertebrate communities and water quality. The treatments in this field
experiment comprised different combinations of large (2 kg) and small (0.7 kg) carp,
and low (330 kg.ha-1), intermediate (570 kg.ha-1) and high (650 kg.ha-1) biomass
densities. Carp impacts were more carp size-dependent than described in previous
studies. In particular, carp size was more important than carp biomass density in
determining the concentration of total phosphorus and algal biomass. On the other hand,
a more even mix of carp sizes increased total nitrogen. The zooplankton and
macroinvertebrate taxa that were more abundant in the presence of carp were the taxa
most able to avoid carp predation and tolerate habitat changes caused by carp
benthivory. To complement the small-spatial scale field experiment, large-scale patterns
of carp distribution, biomass density and recruitment were explored among the rivers of
New South Wales (Australia) in relation to their physical habitat. In contrast to
expectations, and although most recruitment probably occurred at lower-altitudes, the
populations with a size structure and biomass density most likely to cause ecological
degradation occurred at intermediate altitudes. Furthermore, the distribution of smaller
carp (less than or equal to 100 mm, and less than or equal to 300 mm) indicated that the
regulation of river flows does not always favour carp populations, particularly during
drought conditions. Nevertheless, it was concluded in a review of the carp literature,
which incorporated the findings of this study, that invasion by alien carp is most
successful in streams with formerly highly variable flows that are now subject to flow
regulation. Moreover, carp are likely to enhance their advantage in these waters through
habitat modification.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">carp</field><field name="subject">Cyprinus carpio</field><field name="subject">freshwater ecosystems</field><field name="subject">freshwater invertebrates</field><field name="subject">freshwater biology</field><field name="subject">habitat modification</field><field name="subject">ferrel pests</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20050404.110223</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The changes in strength, power and associated

functional variables such as speed and vertical jump ability are understood poorly.
This is particularly the case when dealing with a long-term preparation for a major

The results of this research suggest that a number of isoinertial speed strength
measures may be sensitive to aspects of a training program and therefore be useful
tools for determining the level of development of various underlying neuromuscular
capacities.
Further results provide a question mark about the role of maximum strength in the
development of high velocity functional movements, as increases in maximum
strength did not correlate to changes in measures of functional performance.
An important finding from this research is the potential role of specific isoinertial
speed strength parameters in the detection of neuromuscular fatigue. Time course

with particular reference to Penggilingan in Jakarta</field><field name="creator">Harjoko, Triatno Yudo</field><field name="description">Urbanism in the discipline of architecture has largely been confined to the
analysis of physical appearance of cities. Such an analysis may overlook the crucial
issue, which is political, on the spatial formation of a city like Jakarta This formation
results from the structuration process of a society where the production and
reproduction of society assumes domination from one another. In a dual society, such
as in the city of Jakarta, such a process has an implication of the urban form, that is,
the dual quality of urbanism.
This study examines this dual image of Jakarta, with a particular concern for
the transformation of the inner dynamic of its social life. It concerns the triad of
knowledge-power-space in which the society is produced and reproduced in the timespace
dimension. The kampung is investigated as a locale of social practices,
especially in regard to the low-income urban population. The idea and term
tropotopia is introduced to describe urban form or spatiality that is in a continuous
process of formation and transformation.
The study looks particularly the history of the reproduction of society in
Indonesia, where dominant social systems control allocative and authoritative
resources. Such practices primarily govern the spatial formation of Jakarta. In these
systems, planners and designers acting as agents have played crucial roles in the
structuration of society, and of the space. Planners and designers are seen to be part
of the episteme that develops and informs the poor relation of society. The
dissertation concludes with a reflection on the ways in which the dual quality of
Jakarta is revealed in the interplay in social practices within a triadic knowledge-power-

Australian Alps. Wild horses were first introduced into the Alps over 150 years ago.
Paradoxically, they are a feral animal impacting on the environment, but are also a cultural
icon. Managing wild horse populations is contentious and needs to be founded on knowledge
of their population ecology. This is the first study of its kind in the Australian Alps and
therefore has a broad focus. Four general areas were addressed: distribution, estimation of
abundance and density, population dynamics and the influence of brumby-running. The study
was conducted between 1999 and 2002 inclusive in the Australian Alps national parks, which
form a contiguous protected area in south-eastern Australia from the Australian Capital
Territory (ACT) in the north, through New South Wales (NSW) and into Victoria in the
south.
The current distribution of wild horses in the Australian Alps national parks is patchy. There
are five major discrete populations in NSW and Victoria with the northern most population in
Kosciuszko National Park (NSW) bordering on the ACT. A review of published material and
oral history reveals historic influences on distribution. The presence of each population is
associated with introductions by people. The distribution of some populations expanded after
introductions and many have fluctuated over time. Distributions have been contained or
reduced through control by people, natural events such as snow and drought and by
geographical barriers. Park managers eliminated a population of wild horses in the ACT in
the 1980s. Distributions have expanded in areas without active management (notably
northern Kosciuszko National Park) and are likely to continue expanding under a policy of
no management.
In February and March 2001, abundance and density of wild horses were estimated by
helicopter aerial survey in areas where the mapping showed horses to occur. This was the
first time that these parameters have been estimated empirically. I compared three different
aerial survey techniques (strip, mark-recapture and line transect) based on relative accuracy
and precision and found that line transect analysis gave the highest, most precise estimate.

Given that aerial surveys usually underestimate abundance, this method was also likely to be
the most accurate. Mark-recapture over a 50m wide strip gave a similar result but lacked
precision. Strip and mark-recapture techniques performed poorly over 200m strips because
animals were missed. Numbers observed dropped off dramatically beyond the 50m strip.
Line transect analysis (for both observers combined) gave an estimate of 5010 (+/- 1408SE)
horses while mark recapture over 50 metres gave an estimate of 4915 (+/-2733SE). These
estimates correspond to a density of 1.8 horses km-2 over the area surveyed (2789km2). The
results suggest that aerial surveys of large mammals using a wide strip width (200m) and
mark recapture analysis may seriously underestimate population density.
The population dynamics and demography of wild horses were estimated at three sites, Big
Boggy, Cowombat and Currango, every spring and autumn over 3 years. The sites were
spread widely across the Alps with the aim of obtaining a broad understanding of population
dynamics. The survey used Pollock&#65533;s robust design and natural markings were used to
identify individuals. There was a seasonal spring peak in population size at Big Boggy with
no clear seasonal trend at the other two sites. Mean wild horse densities determined at Big
Boggy (2.01km-2) and Currango (2.13km-2) were not significantly (p&lt;0.5) different to the
density calculated in the aerial survey, whereas density was significantly higher at Cowombat
(6.4 km-2). Census techniques were of limited use in estimating annual population growth
rate because of low precision.
Demographic analysis showed that none of the populations were increasing at the maximum
intrinsic rate (l = 1.2), and the Big Boggy and Cowombat populations may be stable (l =
1.0/yr). There was an apparent trend of food limitation across the sites. Body condition was
positively related (p&lt;0.01) to pasture biomass. The Currango population was increasing (l =
0.09) associated with higher recruitment, body condition and pasture biomass than in the
other two populations studied. The Cowombat population had the lowest annual finite rate of
increase (l = 1.03), and horses at this site were in the poorest condition and pasture biomass
was lowest. The Big Boggy population was intermediate between the two.

Annual adult survival was constant in all populations at 0.91. Survival in the first three years
of life was more variable with the average at each site ranging from 0.63/yr to 0.76/yr. An
average of 0.26 female foals was born per adult female per year. Sensitivity analysis showed
that population growth rate is most sensitive to changes in adult survival, followed by
fecundity and then survival in the first three years of life. The dynamics observed at each site
was representative of the demography of wild horses in other parts of the world and is typical
for large mammalian herbivores.
Brumby-running is a form of harvesting that is currently being used to control wild horses in
the Alpine National Park (Victoria) and is soon to be trialled in Kosciuszko National Park
(NSW). The effectiveness of brumby-running has not been assessed prior to this study. Data
collected by the Alpine Brumby Management Association and predictive modelling were
used to examine the influence of brumby-running on the wild horse population in Alpine
National Park. Brumby-runners remove about 200 horses per year with a preference for
young animals and adult females. More horses are caught in autumn (61/yr) and least in
summer (30/yr) (p&lt;0.05). Brumby-runners do not appear (p&gt;0.05) to target horses in poor
condition. One skilled brumby-runner caught an average of 1.16 horses/day, while his
companions caught an average of 0.55 horses/day. Brumby-runners show behaviour
analogous to social carnivores. Predictive modelling suggests that brumby-runners could
suppress the population of wild horses in Alpine National Park similar to the effects of
predators, or human harvesting of other large mammals. Selecting young animals in the
harvest reduces the impact of harvesting on the population compared to unselective
harvesting, while selecting adult females increases the predicted impact.
There are several management recommendations based on the findings of this thesis that
address concerns for both environmental impact and the cultural value of wild horses. The
distribution of wild horses should not be allowed to expand further, and the size of the wild
horse population should be prevented from increasing further. Other management
recommendations that are more complex involve reducing some populations so that the level
of environmental impact they are causing is acceptable. This requires a definition of
&#65533;acceptable impact.&#65533; Finally managers should consider eradicating smaller populations.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">wild horses</field><field name="subject">brumbies</field><field name="subject">Australian Alps</field><field name="subject">Equus caballus</field><field name="subject">feral animals</field><field name="subject">environmental impact</field><field name="subject">aerial survey</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20050412.151308</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Community title or community chaos : environmental management, community development and governance in rural residential developments established under community title</field><field name="creator">Hazell, Peter</field><field name="description">This thesis contends that; in mainstream rural residential development around the
Australian Capital Territory, use of community title guidelines for sub-division should
consider social processes and environmental considerations along-side economic
imperatives and interactions.
Community title is a form of land tenure that allows for private freehold ownership of
land as well as community owned land within the one sub-division. In New South
Wales, community title was introduced in 1990 under the Community Land
Development Act 1989 (NSW) and the Community Land Management Act 1989
(NSW). Since the introduction of community title, upwards of one hundred and fifty
developments, ranging from just a few blocks to the size of small suburbs, have been
approved throughout the state. The original aim of community title was to provide a
legal framework that underpinned theme-based broad-acre development. Themebased
development could include a Permaculture&#169; village, a rural retreat for likeminded
equine enthusiasts, or even a medieval village.
Community title is also seen as an expedient form of land tenure for both developers
and shire councils. Under community title, a developer only has to submit a single
development application for a multi-stage development. This can significantly reduce
a developer's exposure to risk. From a shire council's perspective, common land and
resources within a development, which would otherwise revert to council
responsibility for management, becomes the collective responsibility of all the land
owners within the development, effectively obviating council from any responsibility
for management of that land. Community title is also being touted in planning and
policy as a way of achieving 'sustainable' environmental management in new subdivisions.
The apparent expediency of community title has meant that development
under these guidelines has very quickly moved beyond theme-based development into
mainstream rural residential development.
Community title effectively provides a framework for participatory governance of
these developments. The rules governing a community title development are set out in
the management statement, which is submitted to the local council and the state
government with the development application. A community association, which
includes all lot owners, manages the development. Unless written into the original
development application, the council has no role in the management of the common
land and resources.
This thesis looks at the peri-urban zone around one of Australia's fastest growing
cities - Canberra, whose population growth and relative affluence is impacting on
rural residential activity in the shires surrounding the Australian Capital Territory.
Yarrowlumla Shire, immediately adjacent to the ACT, has experienced a 362 percent
increase in population since 1971. Much of this growth has been in the form of rural
residential or hobby farm development. Since 1990, about fifteen percent of the
development in Yarrowlumla Shire has been community title. The Yass Shire, to the
north of the ACT, has shown a forty five percent population increase since 1971.
Community title in that shire has accounted for over fifty percent of development
since 1990. The thesis case study is set in Yass Shire.
The major research question addressed in the thesis is; does community title, within
the context of rural residential development around the Australian Capital Territory,
facilitate community-based environmental management and education? Subsidiary
questions are; what are the issues in and around rural residential developments within
the context of the study, who are the stakeholders and what role do they play and;
what skills and support are required to facilitate community-based environmental
management and education within the context of the study area?
To answer the research questions I undertook an interpretive case study, using
ethnographic methods, of rural residential development near the village of
Murrumbateman in the Yass Shire, thirty kilometres north of Canberra. At the time of
the study, which was undertaken in 1996, the developments involved had been
established for about four years. The case study revealed that, as a result of
stakeholders and residents not being prepared for the management implications of
community title, un-necessary conflict was created between residents and between
residents and stakeholders. Community-based environmental management issues were
not considered until these issues of conflict were addressed and residents had spent

enough time in the estates to familiarise themselves with their environment and with
each other.
Once residents realised that decisions made by the community association could affect
them, there developed a desire to participate in the process of management.
Eventually, earlier obstacles were overcome and a sense of community began to
develop through involvement in the community association. As residents became
more involved, the benefits of having ownership of the community association began
to emerge.
However, this research found that management of a broad acre rural residential
development under community title was far more complicated than any of the
stakeholders, or any but the most legally minded residents, were prepared for.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">community title</field><field name="subject">Community Land Development Act 1989 (NSW)</field><field name="subject">freehold land</field><field name="subject">land tenure</field><field name="subject">Community Land Management Act 1989 (NSW)</field><field name="subject">broad-acre development</field><field name="subject">Permaculture&#169;</field><field name="subject">Australian Capital Territory</field><field name="subject">ACT</field><field name="subject">Murrumbateman</field><field name="subject">Yass Shire</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20050415.124034</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An exploratory study of student and instructor characteristics to determine the extent to which self-directed learning can be introduced in the undergraduate curriculum in the Philippines</field><field name="creator">Hsu, Jean Edwina</field><field name="description">This research was in the area of self-directed learning, largely resulting from
the researcher's experience with it whilst in Australia. However, the intent of this
study was to consider factors which would affect the implementation of self-directed
learning principles into the Philippine context.
Education in the Philippines can be described as primarily engaged in the
transmission of knowledge. The structure and culture of education in the Philippines
is one that largely supports a teacher-directed learning environment. Students are
conditioned to be dependent on teachers and are used to studying with the security
of a clear structural plan with very limited opportunities to apply self-directed
learning principles. This approach to education produces static knowledge and
denies the expression and cultivation of the learner. Hence, there is a need to
promote self-directed learning as part of the curriculum.
In attempting to introduce self-directed learning (SDL) in the Philippines, it is
important to analyse student and instructor characteristics which could influence the
extent to which it is applied in the undergraduate university curriculum. This
research project gathers in-depth information on the conduciveness of integrating
self-directed learning in the undergraduate curriculum of De La Salle University
(DLSU) in the Philippines.
This exploratory study aimed to respond to the statement "What is the level of
readiness for self-directed learning of undergraduate students from De La Salle
University? What are the student's perceptions of education, their role in the
educational process, the role of peers and the role of their instructors? What is the
instructor's education orientation? What are the perception of instructors on the
purpose of education, the nature of learners, characteristics of learning
experiences, management of learning experiences, evaluation and the relationship
between the educators and learners and between learners themselves? Are these
perceptions similar and would it be possible to introduce self-directed learning
principles to an undergraduate curriculum for traditional students in De La Salle
University?" The response to these questions could be used in determining whether
self-directed learning principles could in fact be applied in the Philippines, as well as
determine the appropriate balance of pedagogical and andragogical instruction
techniques.
Twenty-three instructors and one hundred students from De La Salle University
in the Philippines participated in the study. Instructors completed the Educational
Orientation Questionnaire and students completed the Self-Directed Learning
Readiness Survey. Follow up intewiews were also conducted to confirm findings
resulting from the survey.
Findings indicate that instructors have an orientation that is a combination of
both pedagogical and andragogical techniques and that students perceive
themselves as having self-directed learning readiness. As a number of learning
situations already utilise andragogical and self-directed learning principles, the
challenge is to promote and encourage SDL and implement it on a wider scope.
Some recommendations have been included in this research on how to implement it

of Australia was conducted between October 1995 and March 1998. E. m. macquarii is
an abundant and widespread species of short-necked turtle that is highly variable in
morphology and related life history attributes. No study in Australia had previously
looked at geographic variation in biological traits in freshwater turtles, hence the level
of variation in E. m. macquarii had been poorly documented. The principal aims of this
study were to investigate the plasticity of life history traits across populations of E. m.
macquarii and to speculate on possible causes. A more intensive study was also
conducted on a rare and suspected declining population of E. m. macquarii in the
Nepean River to determine whether relevant management and conservation measures;
were required.
The study involved comparing various life history attributes between five
populations of E. m. macquarii (Brisbane River, Macleay River, Hunter River, Nepean
River and Murray River). The populations were specifically chosen to account for the
range of variation in body size within this subspecies. Body size (maximum size, size at
maturity, growth rates), population structures (sex ratios, age and size structures),
reproductive traits (clutch mass, clutch size, egg size, egg content, etc.) and other
attributes were collected for each population. Patterns of life history traits, both within
and among populations, were explored so that causes of variation could be sought.
Geographic variation in Body Size and other Related Life History Traits
Body size in E. m. macquarii differed markedly between populations. Females
ranged in maximum sizes (carapace length) of 180 mm in the Macleay River to over
300 mm in the Murray River. E. m. macquarii was sexually dimorphic across all
populations with females larger than males in all cases. Maximum body size was
positively related to the size at which a turtle matures. The size at maturity in turn was
positively related to juvenile growth rates. Age was a more important factor for males
in terms of timing of maturity whereas in females it was body size. Morphological
variation was not only great between populations, but also within populations.
Maximum body size was unrelated to latitude; hence it was inferred that habitat
productivity had the most important influence on geographic variation in body size.
Population structures also differed between populations. Sex ratios did not differ in the
Brisbane, Macleay and Murray Rivers. However, a male bias was present in the Nepean
River population and a female bias in the Hunter River. Juveniles were scarce in the
Brisbane and Macleay Rivers but numerous in the Nepean and Hunter Rivers.
Geographic Variation in Reproduction
There was large variation in reproductive traits across populations of E. m.
macquarii. Nesting season began as early as mid-September in the Brisbane River and
as late as December in the Hunter River, and continued until early January. Populations
in the Hunter and Murray Rivers are likely to produce only one clutch per season while
populations from the Macleay and Nepean Rivers can produce two, and on some
occasions, three clutches annually. The majority of females would appear to reproduce
every year.
Clutch mass, clutch size, and egg size varied greatly both within and among
populations. A large proportion of variation in reproductive traits was due to the effects
of body size. E. m. macquarii from large-bodied populations such as in the Brisbane
and Murray Rivers produced bigger eggs than small-bodied populations. Within a
population, clutch mass, clutch size, and egg size were all correlated with body size,
except the Nepean River. The variability of egg size was smaller in large-bodied
populations where egg size was more constant.
Not all variation in reproductive traits was due to body size. Some of this
variation was due to annual differences within a population. Reproductive traits within
a population are relatively plastic, most likely a result of changing environmental
conditions. Another source is the trade-off between egg size and clutch size. A negative
relationship was found between egg size and clutch size (except the Brisbane River).
Reproductive variation was also influenced by latitudinal effects. Turtles at lower
latitudes produces more clutches, relatively smaller clutch sizes, clutch mass and larger
eggs than populations at higher latitudes. Annual reproductive output is greater in
tropical populations because they can produce more clutches per year in an extended
breeding season.
Eggs that were incubated at warmer temperatures hatched faster and produced
smaller hatchlings. Incubation temperatures above 30&#65533;C increased egg mortality and
hatchling deformities, suggesting this is above the optimum developmental temperature
for E. m. macquarii. Hatchling size was positively related to egg size, hence hatchling
sizes was on average larger in the Murray and Brisbane rivers. However, population
differences remained in hatchling size after adjustments were made for egg size. For
example, hatchlings from the Hunter River were smaller than those from the Macleay
River despite the egg size being the same. These differences were most likely due to the
shorter incubation periods of hatchlings from the Hunter River.
Nepean River
The Nepean River population of E. m. macquarii is at the southern coastal limit
of its range. This is a locally rare population, which is believed to be declining. This
study aimed at determining the distribution, abundance, and population dynamics to
assess whether any conservation management actions were required. E. m. macquarii in
the Nepean River was mainly concentrated between Penrith and Nortons Basin,
although even here it was found at a very low density (10.6 - 12.1 per hectare). The
largest male caught was 227 mm while the largest female was 260.4 mm. Males
generally mature between 140 - 150 mm in carapace length and at four or five years of
age. Females mature at 185 -195 mm and at six to seven years of age.
Compared with other populations of E. macquarii, Nepean River turtles grow
rapidly, mature quickly, are dominated by juveniles, have a male bias and have a high
reproductive output. Far from being a population on the decline, the life history traits
suggest a population that is young and expanding. There are considered to be two
possible scenarios as to why the Nepean River population is at such a low density when it appears to be thriving. The first scenario is that the distribution of the population on
the edge of its range may mean that a small and fluctuating population size may be a
natural feature due to sub-optimal environmental conditions. A second scenario is that
the population in the Nepean River has only recently become established from dumped
pet turtles.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Emydura macquarii macquarii</field><field name="subject">turtle</field><field name="subject">Nepean</field><field name="subject">Hunter</field><field name="subject">Murray</field><field name="subject">Macleay</field><field name="subject">Rivers</field><field name="subject">Murray-Darling basin</field><field name="subject">ecology</field><field name="subject">freshwater amphibious reptiles</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20050418.151350</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Public policy performance in developing countries: urban housing policy with special reference to the national sites and services and squatter upgrading in Tzania</field><field name="creator">Kaare, Suma Clara Mwakitwange</field><field name="description">This study contributes to the developing countries' public policy discourse by linking

H.</field><field name="description">Unemployment was a major problem faced by the ex-servicemen in Malaysia since the
early seventies. Recognising the needs of ex-servicemen, the government through the
organisation of the Veterans Affairs Division (VAD) introduced the resettlement
program for the ex-servicemen with the aim of assisting the veterans to find
employment. However despite the implementation of training programs, the rate of
unemployment among the ex-servicemen was relatively very high, whilst the extent of
the as well as the underlying factors remained unknown, with the resultant ambiguity
of the role of VAD.
This case study was designed to investigate issues related to the employment situation
of the ex-servicemen by surveying those in the capital territory of Kuala Lumpur and
the states of Selangor, Negeri Sembilan and Melaka, who participated in resettlement
training and were discharged in 1993. In addition the states of Johor, Perak and Penang
were included for the survey on the non participants of resettlement training.
The study found that the rate of employment of the ex-servicemen in the states
surveyed was substantially lower than that of the national average. The study also
found that participation in the resettlement training organised by the VAD had
significant effect on increasing the rate of employment besides higher income, shorter
period of unemployment, better readjustment and higher satisfaction with civilian life.
Among the factors analysed, ability to speak English and the economic activity and the
stage of development of the states were found to have significance influence on the rate
of employment. Other factors found to be associated with the employment of the ex-servicemen
included age, education level, rank, urban or rural background, and
matching of training to application.
Based on the findings of this case study recommendations were made to improve the
selectivity of, and access to, resettlement training by all ex-servicemen. Other
recommendations included improving the standard of education and spoken English
before discharge, lowering age of discharge with pension, provision of information
related to employment and counselling service, setting up of data bank of ex-servicemen
and further research.</field><field name="date">1994</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">unemployment</field><field name="subject">Malaysia</field><field name="subject">ex-serviceman</field><field name="subject">Veterans Affairs Division</field><field name="subject">VAD</field><field name="subject">veterans</field><field name="subject">employment</field><field name="subject">resettlement training</field><field name="subject">Kuala Lumpur</field><field name="subject">Selangor</field><field name="subject">Negeri Sembilan</field><field name="subject">Melaka</field><field name="subject">Johor</field><field name="subject">Perak</field><field name="subject">Penang</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20050426.140714</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Microfinance and poverty in Indonesia: an analysis of the role of KUKESRA and MKEJ.</field><field name="creator">Kaluge, David</field><field name="description">Following the success of the Grameen Bank in Bangladesh, Microfinance institutions
(MFIs) which apply group-lending method through the medium of small credit have
been regarded as a new and effective tools for poverty alleviation for the poor in many
Less Developed Countries. This study analyses the role of two MFIs, namely
KUKESRA, a government administered programme and Mitra Karya East Java (MKEJ)
which is a privately managed institution in poverty alleviation in Indonesia. It examines
to what extent these institutions have been successful in helping the poor, and
improving the living standards of the recipients. Two alternative approaches, namely
the institutionalist and the welfarist approaches, are used to examine the question of
whether the poor benefited from the two programmes, followed by a comparison of the
performances between the two.
Using data obtained from a sample survey of 393 respondents in the District of Malang
in East Java, from December 1998 - June 1999, it was found that the differences in
management, organisational structure, programme design, and the system of
coordination all resulted in differences in performance of the two MFI institutions
studied.
It was found that both programmes increased the incomes of the recipients, but the
impact of KUKESRA was much lower than that of MKEJ. However, KUKESRA had a
greater positive effect on employment than MKEJ. Neither of the programmes resulted
in a significant improvement in the consumption of basic needs of the recipients. Of the
two approaches used in the evaluation of the programmes, a good performance in terms
of outreach and sustainability under the institutional approach did not imply that the
poor really benefited from the programme. It was found that the welfarist approach is
much more appropriate in evaluating the effectiveness of MFIs in Indonesia.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Microfinance</field><field name="subject">Living standards</field><field name="subject">KUKESRA</field><field name="subject">MKEJ</field><field name="subject">Mitra Karya East Java</field><field name="subject">Indonesia</field><field name="subject">Microeconomics</field><field name="subject">MFI</field><field name="subject">Microfinance Institution</field><field name="subject">Poverty</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20050509.093311</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An analytical framework on regulatory competence
over online activity</field><field name="creator">Kohl, Uta</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the application of traditional jurisdictional doctrines to
online activity. It analyses not only to what extent, and why, the Internet
challenges existing principles allocating regulatory competence, but the
factors which shape, and must shape, the regulatory responses to these
challenges, in an attempt to create an analytical framework within which the
search for viable solutions can begin.
The overarching argument made in this thesis is that the keys to viable future
Internet regulation are deeply embedded in past and present regulation and
that we cannot simply look for the most efficient legal solutions, regardless of
how they fit within existing laws. This would be inconsistent with the law's
basic function to answer the need for certainty and predictability. Building
upon this fundamental premise, it is further argued, and shown, that an
understanding of the public law - private law dichotomy within the existing
jurisdictional framework, as well as its deeply entrenched status, is essential
for appreciating the severity of the jurisdictional problems caused by the
Internet and actual and likely regulatory responses to them. It is argued that
this explains why both sets of rules have consistently accommodated
transnational online activity differently, giving rise to different problems -
problems which ultimately touch upon fundamental legal notions, such as
formal justice, the rule of law or obedience to law which cannot but set further
outer parameters of the search for solutions to the jurisdictional problems
triggered by the Internet.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Regulatory competence</field><field name="subject">law</field><field name="subject">online law</field><field name="subject">internet regulation</field><field name="subject">jurisdictional issues</field><field name="subject">Australian Online Law</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20050509.105817</field></doc><doc><field name="title">"Balanced development" a study of the Murray Committee on Australian Universities</field><field name="creator">McShane, Ian</field><field name="description">This thesis is a study of the work of the Committee on Australian Universities of 1957,
usually called the Murray Committee after its chairman.
Interpretations of the Murray Committee's work usually focus on its achievement in
securing funding increases for Australian universities at a time of great financial need, and
establishing an arms-length grants body that assisted what was referred to as the "balanced
development" of the sector. In this thesis I look at the context of the inquiry and the text
of the committee's report to place this outcome within what I consider to be the broader
scope and intent of the committee's work. I argue that the committee was anxious to
secure the position of the universities at the top of an educational hierarchy in a period of
change and challenge. The committee responded to the Commonwealth Government's
request that the future pattern of university development be in the best interests of the
nation by defending what they saw as the traditional role and purpose of the university. I
argue that this response is one that has at various times been put foward by universities to
demands for change, a response that, to paraphrase a view popular in university circles at
the time, seeks to give government what it needs rather than what it wants.
In this instance the committee looked to an English model of a residential university as the
"traditional" template on which Australian institutions should be fashioned. The
committee argued for the value of a broad, liberal education as emblematic of university
pedagogy in an era of increasing knowledge specialisation and increasing confusion of
purpose in the tertiary education system. It considered that a residential university
conducted on liberal principles was the best institutional representation of its ideal of a
community of scholars. The committee set down in its report a range of strategies by
which the ideal might be realised, or at least approached, in the Australian context. It paid

particular attention to the incorporation of first year students - the newest and most
vulnerable members of the community. I also argue that in setting down its ideas on the
institutional form and pedagogy of the university, the committee made assumptions about
the personal characteristics of "the scholar", and I analyse these assumptions.
In redefining the university in the Australian context the committee also engaged in a
process of defining the roles and purposes of other tertiary education institutions. The
committee took a hierarchical view of social organisation to their work, and viewed the
education system in this light. The committee charged the universities with oversight of
the Australian education system and intellectual guardianship of the Australian community.
University graduates, in the committee's view, were the natural leaders of Australian
society, and their education should prepare them to undertake properly this role. In
redefining the university the committee members engaged in a process of boundarysetting,
consolidating an institutional hierarchy in what they saw as a confused and
uncoordinated system. However, they sought to incorporate a commitment to
meritocracy and expansion of education opportunity within this perspective and urged the
creation of pathways between the institutions.
To characterise the committee's work I extend the concept of "balanced development" to
the various areas in which the committee made recommendations. The concept of
balanced development can be seen to refer to the proper development of the individual in
the university system (the production of a balanced personality, or the education of the
whole person); to the balanced development and co-ordination of the university sector; to
the development of the tertiary education system as a whole and its proper articulation
with the labour market; and to the process of reconciling the needs of the universities with
the demands of government</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Murray Committee</field><field name="subject">Austrtalian Universities</field><field name="subject">funding</field><field name="subject">educational hirarchy</field><field name="subject">residential university</field><field name="subject">tertiary education</field><field name="subject">balanced development</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20050509.161344</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Papua New Guinea Senior Education Officers' views on Leadership: A Cross-Cultural Perspective</field><field name="creator">Koro, Paul</field><field name="description">This study examines senior education officers' (SEOs) perceptions of the
meanings and characteristics of the term 'leadership' both from their
traditional PNG and Western perspectives. Data were drawn from
questionnaires returned by 20 SEOs, 2 recorded interviews and a focus-group
methodology.
The purposes of the study are to: (i) define the meaning of leadership from
the senior education officers' perspectives and through the review of the
literature; and (ii) identify key characteristics and skills of the leadership role
of senior education officers in PNG today, as a basis for improving practice
and informing knowledge about leadership.
Respondents were asked to define the meaning of the term leadership, and to
describe their most memorable leadership experiences which may have
helped to shape their understanding of leadership. They were also asked to
identify and to list the key leadership functions, qualities and skills/abilities
which they perceive to be most important in their roles today, and for the
foreseeable future.
Literature on leadership is complex and wide ranging. Those which provided
data of particular significance in specific areas directly related to this study
include: Rost (1991) on the definitions of leadership; Kouzes and Posner (1993
and 1987) in relation to characteristics of leadership; on educational
leadership (Sergiovanni et al 1987, Turney et al 1992, and Fullan 1991 and
1992) in relation to the functions, qualities and related skills/abilities of
educational leaders; on culture and cross-cultural studies (Hallinger and
Leithwood 1996, Heck 1996, Bates 1992); and various ethnographic sources on
PNG and Melanesian traditional and contemporary leadership.
A number of significant findings have emerged through this research study.
The first, relates to a firm view of traditional PNG/Melanesian leadership as a
'shared leadership', defined in this study as a shared influence relationship
among members of a social unit through a mutual quest for their existence. 
The notion of shared leadership emphasises the importance of reciprocal
generosity, cooperation and competition for Melanesians in their daily quest
for their needs and aspirations based on mutual concern, care and devotion
for one another. The great diversity of people and cultures of Melanesians
also enriches the view of 'leadership as cultural practice' (Gerstner and O'Day
1995, Heck 1996, Bates 1992) and the interplay of 'education as cultural
construction'. These insepearable concepts provide logical and promising
framework both towards transcending knowledge, cultures and poeple, and
an interest to engage in more cross-cultural research.
This study identifies among the most pressing problems of contemporary
leadership in PNG relates to the inability of leaders to transcend traditional
knowledge and customary practices with the new Western knowledge and
practices. In other words, the problems of transcending the notion of 'shared
leadership' with Western leadership characterised by public accountability,
credibility and integrity normally associated with leadership in public office
cannot easily be matched and transferred. This study suggests a 'transcendent
leadership model' as a potential solution toward achieving this end.
Extending beyond one's own limits, to do something extraordinary and
admirable for the common good is what transcendent leadership model
suggests every leader must be able to do. The foundations of transcendent
behaviour the literature suggests include: moral and ethical living (Starratt
1996); ambition, competence, and integrity (Bennis and Goldsmith 1994); and
honesty, forward-outlook and inspiration (Kouzes and Posner 1993).
The literature indicates that these qualities and skills require proper
'intellectual conditioning' (Ramoi 1987, Narakobi 1991), to produce 'educated
persons' (Starratt 1996) who are able to understand, appreciate, critique, and
participate in their cultures, traditions, and history.
This study therefore investigates and defines the meanings, roles and
functions of the concepts of leadership, culture and education in relation to
the cross-cultural conditions of the work of SEOs in PNG.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Senior education officers</field><field name="subject">leadership</field><field name="subject">education</field><field name="subject">knowledge</field><field name="subject">culture</field><field name="subject">transcending knowledge</field><field name="subject">Melanesians</field><field name="subject">Papua New Guinea</field><field name="subject">cross-cultural perspective</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20050516.100024</field></doc><doc><field name="title">ASCIS subject headings and student terminology : the relationship between the subject headings used in manual school library catalogues in New South Wales and the subject access terms generated by NSW Higher School Certificate syllabus documents, textbooks and examination questions</field><field name="creator">Sorby, Janet</field><field name="description">The present study was undertaken to investigate the concerns of secondary school teacher-librarians, that the subject headings set down by the Australian Schools Catalogue Information Service (ASCIS) do not cover topics in senior sourses of study.

Terms were extracted from three textual sources (syllabus, textbook and examination papers) and checked against the subject headings in the ASCIS Subject Headings List.  A comparison was made between terms which matched exactly, those which were only partially matched and those which had no match.  The linguistic complexity of the term (single-word or multi-word) and the number of textual sources using the term were also taken into account.
The results showed a varying degree of match between textual terms and subject headings.  Single-word terms found in more than one textual source were much more likely to be found in the subject headings than those from only one textual source.  Multi-word terms were found less frequently than single-word terms, but were also more likely to be found when they came from more than one textual source.  There was a large number of partial matches in this group, and these were found to be more general in concept than the textual terms.

provisions in the Corporations Law is an area of the law which has been largely
neglected by the legislature. Although there have been several legislative reforms on
remedies since the Corporations Law came into force, those reforms were ad hoc in
nature and no attempt has been made to carry out a comprehensive review to assess the
effectiveness of the existing sanctions and remedies in context of the needs of
contemporary society. In consequence, there is increasing concern that the remedies
employed in Australia for breaches of the Corporations Law are inadequate, inconsistent,
out-dated and are confined within a narrow range.
This thesis seeks to evaluate the current package of sanctions and remedies provided
under Part 3.2 of the Corporations Law. As part of this exercise, comparative studies
are made with the remedies of other jurisdictions. The provisions for sanctions in Part
3.2 are measured against parallel provisions in the Crimes Act of the Commonwealth and
of New South Wales and Victoria. They are also measured against corresponding
provisions in selected foreign jurisdictions. A further comparison is made between the
traditional civil remedies under the common law and those in the Corporations Law.
The evaluation of the sanctioning regime in Part 3.2 is made against the criteria
appropriateness, adequacy, consistency and accessibility. This thesis discusses the need
for a complete re-assessment of the penalty structure to bring the remedies in line with
community expectations.</field><field name="date">1994</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Corporations law part 2.3</field><field name="subject">sanctions under law</field><field name="subject">jurisdictions</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20050523.102418</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Public versus private heath care provision in the northeast of  Thailand</field><field name="creator">Laohasiriwong, Wongsa</field><field name="description">This thesis is a comparative study of public and private health care provision in Northeast

are more efficient and effective than their public health counterparts The thesis also
examines equity concerns raised by the growth of private sector medical institutions The
study commences by describing the changes in health problems, health policies and health
care delivery in developing countries and Thailand that have led to the development and
growth of private health care. This is followed by detailed consideration of the Northeast of
Thailand including the socioeconomic context, health indicators and health delivery
systems development paying particular attention to private sector growth. The remainder of
the thesis is comprised of an empirical study of selected public and private sector hospitals
in Northeast Thailand and an analysis of the results Much of the data was collected from
questionnaires delivered to patients and staff in the study hospitals.
The major findings include roughly similar levels of patient satisfaction between public and
private hospitals; patients utilizing public hospitals often had no choice of which
institutions to use, and the average incomes of patients attending private hospitals were
above those of public hospital patients. There was undoubted inequity of access to private
sector facilities. Data gathered from hospital staff showed greater levels of satisfaction with
staffing levels and quality in private hospitals than in public ones. Salaries were more
compressed in public hospitals due to central government rules than in private hospitals
whose management was based on market considerations. However, higher salaries were
paid to skilled professionals in the private sector. Public sector hospital management was
typically bureaucratic with central government guidelines and decisions determining many
aspects of hospital organization. It was found that comparison between public and private
hospitals was complicated by the different missions and activities of institutions in the two
sectors. The thesis concludes by arguing that the mixture of public and private health care
providers has contributed to a more competitive atmosphere which has encouraged greater
concern with quality and efficiency in the delivery of health services in Thailand.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">health care</field><field name="subject">private</field><field name="subject">public</field><field name="subject">quality and efficiency</field><field name="subject">salary equality</field><field name="subject">Northeast Thailand</field><field name="subject">management of hospitals</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20050523.100911</field></doc><doc><field name="title">OTC derivatives filling the gaps in investor protection</field><field name="creator">Lee, Foong Mee</field><field name="description">The dramatic growth of over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives in the last two decades
and the ever-expanding range of financial derivative have triggered concerns as
regards investor protection. These concerns have been exacerbated in recent times by
phenomenal losses sustained by several large corporations (including municipalities), in
the United States, Europe and Asia.
This thesis seeks to evaluate the capacity of the existing regulatory framework in
Australia to provide protection to participants trading in the OTC derivatives markets.
The evaluation is carried out in three parts: first, by identifying the gaps in the
Corporations Law regimes, second by determining the extent to which the general
criminal and consumer laws are capable of stepping into the breach left open by the
Corporations Law and third, by locating the gaps in the supervisory structure by
identify the participants who are not subject to any form of supervision by the
regulators.

The examination conducted in this thesis of the regimes in Chapters 7 and 8 of the
Corporations Law reveals a number of gaps in respect of investor protection.
Significantly, the OTC derivatives market, which is by far the larger market compared
to the on-exchange derivatives market, is generally unregulated by the Corporations
Law. Comparative analysis between the sanctions provisions in Chapters 7 and 8 of
the Corporations Law and those in the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) and the Trade
Practices Act 1974 (Cth) indicated that whilst these latter Acts have the potential to
act as a substitute for some of the sanctions provisions in the Corporation Law, about
half of the sanctions provisions under the Corporations Law regime has no equivalent
provisions in these Acts. In consequence, some regulatory gaps remain. Gaps also
occur in the supervisory structure as the surveillance by regulators of market
participants is focused along institutional lines.

The failure of the law to provide adequate protection to investors trading in the OTC
derivatives markets is due primarily to an outdated, inflexible and inappropriate
regulatory framework which, when originally constructed, was not intended to
regulated the broad spectrum of financial derivatives. This thesis discusses the gaps
and deficiencies in the Corporations Law regime and also discusses the recent
recommendations made by the Wallis Committee and the Companies and Securities

cyclists and recent work describing the demands of competition, there is a paucity of
similar information regarding elite mountain bike (MTB) cyclists. The aim of the
present work was to describe the physiological characteristics and the demands of
competition for successful MTB cyclists relative to successful road cyclists.
Internationally competitive cyclists from both disciplines (seven MTB and seven road)
completed the following laboratory tests: anthropometric measurements, an incremental
cycle ergometer test and a 30 minute laboratory time trial. In addition, the power output
profile obtained in the field from a world-class MTB cyclist riding a simulated race
were compared to successful road cycling performances (placing top 3) in flat (FLAT),
semi-mountainous (SEMO), high-mountainous (HIMO), individual time trial (ITT) and
criterium (CRIT) road races.

These results indicate that success in international MTB racing
requires high power-to-weight characteristics complemented by a light and lean
physique. MTB racing is associated with greater torque at the pedal crank, a more
constant effort with less time at lower power outputs and a higher frequency of highintensity
surges than road racing. Therefore coaches should take into account these
unique MTB racing characteristics when devising training programs for elite athletes.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">MTB cyclists</field><field name="subject">cyclists</field><field name="subject">anthropometric measurements</field><field name="subject">road races</field><field name="subject">competition demands on athletes</field><field name="subject">mountain bikes</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20050523.110406</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The concept of excellence in education in ACT primary schools</field><field name="creator">Wilde, Lee Ellen</field><field name="description">From a philosophical and historical analysis of education in Australia since World 
War II and consideration of the research into school effectiveness and community
expectations of education, a concept of "excellence" was derived: "Excellence in
education" in its various institutionalised forms describes a state where there is a
community perception that worthwhile goals have been formulated, attempts are
made to achieve those goals using appropriately defined processes and that those
goals are being achieved to the satisfaction of community members.
It was also asserted that because of the diversity introduced into Australian society by
sociocultural, economic and political developments since World War II, "excellence
in education" may take many forms. This demands diversity in schooling so that
these different forms of excellence may be achieved. This "excellence" was seen to
be a relative concept rather than an absolute one.
Information was collected from six primary schools from both the government and
non-govenunent sectors of the ACT, using swey instruments, interviews and
document analysis. This information related to the perceptions of the family, staff
and student sectors of these schools about the importance and achievement of various
factors in the areas of goals and philosophy, curriculum, teaching and learning
practices, general organisation and school atmosphere.
The study found that, while these schools, all being concerned with the education of
primary school children in the same local and national context, exhibited certain
common elements, they also demonstrated a variety of other features in a variety of
combinations, giving each school a distinctive profile. Moreover, these school
communities each judged their particular school being "Excellent" and "meeting expectations", and yet were accepting of some discrepancy between what they considered ideal and what was actually achieved.
Thus it was shown that excellence in education is a relative concept in the ACT, if not
in contemporary Australian society as a whole.</field><field name="date">1992</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ACT primary schools</field><field name="subject">ACT primary education</field><field name="subject">Australian Capital territory education</field><field name="subject">education goals</field><field name="subject">government schools</field><field name="subject">non-government schools</field><field name="subject">diversity</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20050527.143328</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Researching an essay: Undergraduates' ways of experiencing information literacy</field><field name="creator">Lupton, Mandy</field><field name="description">This thesis presents a study of students' ways of experiencing information literacy when
researching an essay in a first year university course. The aims of the study were to
contribute to an understanding and awareness of information literacy from the students'
experience, and to inform curriculum design for information literacy education.
The study involved semi-structured interviews with 20 undergraduate students enrolled
in a first year environmental studies course at the Australian National University in
2002. A phenomenographic approach was used as the methodological and theoretical
basis for the study. This research was modelled on Limberg's (1998) study of Year 12
students researching an assignment. It is positioned between Limberg's study and
Bruce's (1997) study of higher educators' conceptions of information literacy.
The experience of information literacy included the interrelationship between the essay,
information and learning. The way in which students experienced a focus on learning,
focus on the essay task, use of information in the course, use of information in the
essay, use of contrasting perspectives and development of argument formed the
qualitative differences in experience. Students experienced information literacy when
researching an essay as: looking for evidence to backup an existing argument; using
background information to develop an argument; and applying learning to help solve
environmental problems. A further outcome of the study is that information literacy is
framed as a learning approach. These outcomes may have significance for students,
teachers, librarians, academic skills advisors, academic developers, policy makers and
administrators in higher education.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">essays</field><field name="subject">undergraduates</field><field name="subject">research</field><field name="subject">administration</field><field name="subject">arts</field><field name="subject">information sciences</field><field name="subject">information literacy</field><field name="subject">higher education</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20050530.091245</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Competency-Based assessment in Australia - does it work?</field><field name="creator">Mhlongo, Nanikie Charity</field><field name="description">South Africa since the liberation in 1994 has faced a lot of changes. The changes
include being a member of the international community. As part of the international
community, South Africa is finding itself largely faced by the challenges associated
with this position. Looking at other countries South Africa is realizing that the world
is looking at better ways of educating their people and organizing their education and
training systems so that they might gain the edge in an increasingly competitive
economic global environment. Success and survival in such a world demands that
South Africa has a national education and training system that provides quality
learning and promotes the development of a nation that is committed to life-long
learning.

Institutions of higher education in South Africa are currently changing their present
education system to conform to a Competency-Based Training (CBT) system. This
system has only been planned but not implemented yet and it is not clear how CBT
will be implemented, especially how the learners are going to be assessed.
Competency-Based Assessment (CBA) is an integral part of CBT that needs
particular attention if the new system is to succeed.

The key aims of this thesis are to investigate the current assessment policy and
practice at the Canberra Institute of Technology (CIT) underpinned by Competency-
Based Training system. The project will describe and analyze the Competency-Based
Assessment system used within CIT's CBT system. The project will focus on:
Observing classroom practice of CBA, analyzing students' and teachers' perceptions
of their involvement with CBA, and analyzing employers' perceptions of the
effectiveness of CBA.

The main aim of this thesis is to suggest recommendations for an assessment model
that will be suitable to implement within hospitality training institutions in South

efficacy of heparin and hydrocortisone additive
to extend the life of peripheral cannulae in
children</field><field name="creator">Milbourne, Katrina Jane</field><field name="description">Repeated cannulation of children during the course of treatment is distressing for the
child, their family and to their nurses. Some paediatric units endeavour to minimise recannulation
by employing strategies to reduce complications such as phlebitis and
thrombosis formation. One strategy is to infuse low dose heparin and hydrocortisone
(HEPHC). However, its effectiveness in prolonging cannula survival is inconclusive.
There is also concern about the potential risks of administering these preparations to
children.

A randomised, controlled, blinded trial was conducted that examined the effectiveness
of continuous infusion of low dose HEPHC in a group of children requiring long term
intravenous antibiotics in a general paediatric unit. Comparisons of cannula
complications and cannulae survival times were made in children receiving either
continuous infusions of clear fluids or low dose HEPHC.

The results demonstrated that there was no statistically significant difference (Logrank
statistic=l.l, p=0.3) in cannula survival times between the two groups. It was also
found that the bacterial and fungal colonisation of cannula for these children was
extremely low. Based on these findings it is recommended that routine administration
of low dose HEPHC to extend cannula survival time be discontinued. The findings
also support current practice of removing cannula in children only when a complication
occurs on completion of treatment.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">repeated cannulation</field><field name="subject">children</field><field name="subject">treatment</field><field name="subject">HEPHC</field><field name="subject">heparin</field><field name="subject">hydrocortisone</field><field name="subject">paediatrics</field><field name="subject">intravenous antibiotics</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20050530.104945</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Study of Guidance Curriculum
in Hong Kong Primary Schools</field><field name="creator">Luk Fong, Yuk Yee Pattie</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the question of what kind of guidance curriculum is
suitable for primary schools in Hong Kong. The call for the development of guidance
curriculum for primary school children in Hong Kong arises from the needs of
students: their need for enhancement of their self-concept, and has been translated
into guidance and educational policy documents, and structural and administrative
changes in schools which allow more time for the development of guidance in
primary schools.
Given that the educational context of Hong Kong is "East meets West," the
researcher posits that, in studying guidance in Hong Kong, both Eastern and Western
traditions in guidance must be taken into consideration. The researcher further argues
that a guidance curriculum that is suitable for the primary school children in Hong
Kong should start by looking at the particular experiences, expectations and tensions
that educators, guidance professionals, teachers, parents and children are facing in the
competing and changing contexts of the Hong Kong society. These expectations and
tensions are very much related to the colossal changes in Hong Kong and are
reflections of various degrees of overlaps between "East" and "West", as well as
"past" and "present".
The researcher has drawn on literature concerning globalization as
hybridization, the Chinese concept of yin-yang and the psychological processes at
work when Western modernization meet with indigenous Chinese culture, to explain
the dynamics of change in the Hong Kong context. This thesis develops a hybrid
framework for studying such changes. The framework consists of open-ended
questions designed by the researcher from the literature, an adaptation of Confucian's
cardinal relationships and Lawton's model for curriculum development

A qualitative case study method is used for this study. Data are drawn from the
author's own experience in a two-week teaching attachment in a primary school, and
interviews with guidance professionals, primary school principals, teachers and
students in three selected primary schools in Hong Kong. A qualitative study is
chosen so that the multiple realities of teaching guidance in schools can be understood
in their naturalistic settings. The boundary of the case is Hong Kong with its
implementation of Hong Kong versions of Radd's (1993) Grow with guidance system.
Three out of the eight Grow with guidance system pilot schools are studied. The
chosen schools differ in student composition, school type, and methods of
implementation of the guidance curriculum.
Data are obtained by individual interviews, the in-depth study of one case
study school by the researcher as participant observer, and content analysis of
guidance materials in the case study schools. Data by these three methods and from
different stakeholders are triangulated, as information obtained is checked against
each other. This study uses multiple forms of evidences and they persuade by reason.
Being a qualitative case study, its purpose is to illuminate but not to generalize. The
criteria for judging the success of this study depend on the richness and accuracy of
data, as well as the coherence, insight and instrumental utility in presenting and
reading the data.
The researcher argues for a hybrid guidance curriculum for the primary
schools in Hong Kong to suit the hybrid contexts in Hong Kong. Data obtained from
content analysis and the case study schools show that the philosophical, sociological
and psychological factors as well as the content, pedagogies, organization for teaching
and practical arrangements of the guidance curricula are hybrid in the Hong Kong
implementation of Radd's Grow with guidance system. The researcher concludes that
a useful guidance curriculum for Hong Kong primary schools must first listen to the
different voices of all stakeholders about the guidance curricula and their "self-other
relationships", for those voices reflect their tensions and reality. Much of their voices
are presented as stories following the Chinese storying traditions. Methods to help
children to deal with tensions and conflicts at personal, school, home and societal
levels include giving up self to follow others [chinese characters omitted, knowing self and others [chinese characters omitted], awareness of
and accommodation of differences [chinese characters omitted]context
analysis, communication using culturally and contextually appropriate ways and
emotional management.
This thesis contributes to knowledge by inventing the concept of "hybrid
guidance curriculum" to suit the hybrid context of Hong Kong. A new hybrid research
methodology is also developed in this thesis which enables the forming of new
categories of "self-other relationships" and new hybrid key concepts for the guidance
curriculum. As such, this study allows for the re-reading of new ideas and practices of
traditions in a modern hybrid society. Moreover, it also highlights the importance of
the development of a reflexive self in which one negotiates one's own positions and
one's relationships with others. In a special case, this study examines the fundamental
issue of adapting and integrating western traditions in a country with different culture
and contexts. Research frontiers, home school co-operation and implications to
teacher educators, practitioners and policy makers in the guidance fields are discussed.
Although this research is basically about Hong Kong, the findings may also be
relevant to other places in the world where modernization has taken place in the
indigenous culture.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Hong Kong education</field><field name="subject">guidance curriculum</field><field name="subject">primary schools</field><field name="subject">Rad's Grow with Guidance System</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20050530.092440</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The impact of electronic performance monitoring on staff turnover in a call centre environment</field><field name="creator">Morison, Rebecca</field><field name="description">Call Centres represent one of the fastest growing industries today. In a competitive
business environment the service delivered by Call Centre operators needs to be quantified
and this is achieved through Electronic Performance Monitoring (EPM). This study
considered the effects of EPM, and related factors such as job control, task complexity,
performance, goal-setting and feedback, on the job satisfaction, organisational commitment
and work stress, of Call Centre operators. The impact of these factors on staff turnover,
which media reports suggest is very high for many Call Centres, was also considered. A
total of 388 participants (265 females, 123 males) completed a voluntary self-report
questionnaire. All participants were Call Centre operators who were working in one of 27
call centres across Australia in a variety of industries, including Banking &amp; Finance, IT,
Employment, Insurance and Telecommunications. All operators were working in an
electronically monitored environment. Regression and path analyses revealed age, that is
younger employees, and job dissatisfaction to be the only variables that predicted staff
turnover. A positive perception of EPM was predicted by a positive perception of both
goal-setting and feedback. It was concluded that while staff turnover was high in the
current sample, it was not associated with perceptions of EPM, and other factors appeared
to be more important.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">call centres</field><field name="subject">Electronic Performance Monitoring</field><field name="subject">EPM</field><field name="subject">staff turnover</field><field name="subject">management</field><field name="subject">staff satisfaction</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20050530.111117</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Plant species rarity and data restriction influence the prediction success of species distribution models</field><field name="creator">Mugodo, James</field><field name="description">There is a growing need for accurate distribution data for both common and rare plant
species for conservation planning and ecological research purposes. A database of more than
500 observations for nine tree species with different ecological and geographical
distributions and a range of frequencies of occurrence in south-eastern New South Wales
(Australia) was used to compare the predictive performance of logistic regression models,
generalised additive models (GAMs) and classification tree models (CTMs) using different
data restriction regimes and several model-building strategies. Environmental variables
(mean annual rainfall, mean summer rainfall, mean winter rainfall, mean annual temperature,
mean maximum summer temperature, mean minimum winter temperature, mean daily
radiation, mean daily summer radiation, mean daily June radiation, lithology and
topography) were used to model the distribution of each of the plant species in the study
area.
Model predictive performance was measured as the area under the curve of a receiver
operating characteristic (ROC) plot. The initial predictive performance of logistic regression
models and generalised additive models (GAMs) using unrestricted, temperature restricted,
major gradient restricted and climatic domain restricted data gave results that were contrary
to current practice in species distribution modelling. Although climatic domain restriction
has been used in other studies, it was found to produce models that had the lowest predictive
performance. The performance of domain restricted models was significantly (p = 0.007)
inferior to the performance of major gradient restricted models when the predictions of the
models were confined to the climatic domain of the species. Furthermore, the effect of data
restriction on model predictive performance was found to depend on the species as shown by
a significant interaction between species and data restriction treatment (p = 0.013). As found
in other studies however, the predictive performance of GAM was significantly (p = 0.003)
better than that of logistic regression. The superiority of GAM over logistic regression was
unaffected by different data restriction regimes and was not significantly different within
species.
The logistic regression models used in the initial performance comparisons were based on
models developed using the forward selection procedure in a rigorous-fitting model-building
framework that was designed to produce parsimonious models. The rigorous-fitting modelbuilding
framework involved testing for the significant reduction in model deviance (p =
0.05) and significance of the parameter estimates (p = 0.05). The size of the parameter
estimates and their standard errors were inspected because large estimates and/or standard
errors are an indication of model degradation from overfilling or effecls such as mullicollinearily.
For additional variables to be included in a model, they had to contribule
significantly (p = 0.025) to the model prediclive performance. An attempt to improve the
performance of species distribution models using logistic regression models in a rigorousfitting
model-building framework, the backward elimination procedure was employed for
model selection, bul it yielded models with reduced performance.
A liberal-filling model-building framework that used significant model deviance reduction at
p = 0.05 (low significance models) and 0.00001 (high significance models) levels as the
major criterion for variable selection was employed for the development of logistic
regression models using the forward selection and backward elimination procedures. Liberal
filling yielded models that had a significantly greater predictive performance than the
rigorous-fitting logistic regression models (p = 0.0006). The predictive performance of the
former models was comparable to that of GAM and classification tree models (CTMs). The
low significance liberal-filling models had a much larger number of variables than the high
significance liberal-fitting models, but with no significant increase in predictive
performance. To develop liberal-filling CTMs, the tree shrinking program in S-PLUS was
used to produce a number of trees of differenl sizes (subtrees) by optimally reducing the size
of a full CTM for a given species. The 10-fold cross-validated model deviance for the
subtrees was plotted against the size of the subtree as a means of selecting an appropriate
tree size. In contrast to liberal-fitting logistic regression, liberal-fitting CTMs had poor predictive performance.
Species geographical range and species prevalence within the study area were used to
categorise the tree species into different distributional forms. These were then used, to
compare the effect of plant species rarity on the predictive performance of logistic regression
models, GAMs and CTMs. The distributional forms included restricted and rare (RR)
species (Eucalyptus paliformis and Eucalyptus kybeanensis), restricted and common (RC)
species (Eucalyptus delegatensis, Eucryphia moorei and Eucalyptus fraxinoides),
widespread and rare (WR) species (Eucalyptus data) and widespread and common (WC)
species (Eucalyptus sieberi, Eucalyptus pauciflora and Eucalyptus fastigata). There were
significant differences (p = 0.076) in predictive performance among the distributional forms
for the logistic regression and GAM. The predictive performance for the WR distributional
form was significantly lower than the performance for the other plant species distributional
forms. The predictive performance for the RC and RR distributional forms was significantly
greater than the performance for the WC distributional form. The trend in model predictive
performance among plant species distributional forms was similar for CTMs except that the
CTMs had poor predictive performance for the RR distributional form.
This study shows the importance of data restriction to model predictive performance with
major gradient data restriction being recommended for consistently high performance. Given
the appropriate model selection strategy, logistic regression, GAM and CTM have similar
predictive performance. Logistic regression requires a high significance liberal-fitting
strategy to both maximise its predictive performance and to select a relatively small model
that could be useful for framing future ecological hypotheses about the distribution of
individual plant species. The results for the modelling of plant species for conservation
purposes were encouraging since logistic regression and GAM performed well for the
restricted and rare species, which are usually of greater conservation concern.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">accurate distribution data</field><field name="subject">restriction of data</field><field name="subject">prediction models</field><field name="subject">plants</field><field name="subject">generalized additive models</field><field name="subject">classification tree models</field><field name="subject">GAMs</field><field name="subject">CTMs</field><field name="subject">RR</field><field name="subject">restricted and rare</field><field name="subject">restricted and common</field><field name="subject">widespread and common</field><field name="subject">WC</field><field name="subject">WR</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20050530.112801</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Art and design education in South Australian Schools, from the early 1880s to the 1920s: the influence of South Kensington and Harry Pelling Gill</field><field name="creator">Aland, Jenny</field><field name="description">This thesis focuses specifically on what was taught in schools in South
Australia in the context of art and design education. The period covered by the
study extends from the 1880s, when a Central Educational Authority was
established in South Australia, to the late 1920s, when significant changes to art
and design philosophies and course designs became identifiable.
The nature and content of the art and design courses designed and used in
South Australia is examined against an historical background of influences such as
the South Kensington System of drawing and that devised by Walter Smith for the
Massachusetts educational system in the United States of America.
The significant contribution of Harry Pelling Gill to the teaching of art and
design in schools is closely examined. It is posited that his single influence affected
the teaching of art and design in South Australian schools until well into the
twentieth century.
The process of the study looks in detail at the overall philosophies behind the
teaching of art and design, the methodologies employed and the classroom practice
which pupils and teachers undertook in the pursuit of courses outlined. Issues
such as methods of teacher training, correspondence courses, examinations and
exhibitions are considered as these relate to the central theme of the study.
The study concludes in the late 1920s, with the advent of a revised course of
instruction for public elementary schools, which heralded significant changes in
both the content and methodology of art and design teaching in South Australian
schools.</field><field name="date">1992</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">art education</field><field name="subject">design education</field><field name="subject">South Australia</field><field name="subject">1880s</field><field name="subject">1920s</field><field name="subject">South Kensington System</field><field name="subject">Walter Smith</field><field name="subject">Harry Pelling Gill</field><field name="subject">Central Education Authority</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20050601.145749</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The ontology of communication: a reconcepualisation of the nature of communication through a critique of mass media public communication campaigns</field><field name="creator">Shrensky, Ruth</field><field name="description">Conclusion. It is probably now appropriate to close a chapter in the history of
public communication campaigning. Weaknesses which have
usually been seen as instrumental can now be seen for what they
are: conceptual failures grounded in compromised ontologies and
false epistemologies. As I showed in the last chapter, even when
viewed within their own narrow empiricist frame, public
communication campaigns fail to satisfy a test of empirical efficacy.
But empirical failure reveals a deeper moral failure: the failure of
government to properly engage in a conversation with the citizens
to whom they are ultimately responsible. Whether public
communication campaigns are a symptom or a cause of this failure
lies beyond the scope of this thesis. But there can be little doubt that
the practice of these campaigns has encouraged the persistence of an
inappropriate relation between state and citizens.
The originators and managers of mass media public communication
campaigns conceive of and execute their creations as persuasive
devices aimed at the targets who have been selected to receive their
messages. But we do not see ourselves as targets (and there are
profound ethical reasons why we should not be treated as such),
neither do we engage with the mass media as message receivers. On
the contrary, as social beings, we become actively and creatively
involved with the communicative events which we attend to and
participate in; the mass media, like all other communication
opportunities, provide the means for generating new meanings,
new ways of understanding, new social realities. But people are
constrained from participating fully in public discussion about social
issues; the government's construal of individuals as targets and of
communication as transmitted messages does not provide the
discursive space for mutual interaction.
Governments should aim to encourage the active engagement of
citizens in public discussion by conceiving of and executing public
communication as part of a continuing conversation, not as
packaged commodities to be marketed and consumed, or as messages
to be received. It is time to encourage alternative practices-practices
which open up the possibility of productive conversations which
will help transform the relationship between citizens and state.
However, as I have argued in this thesis, changed practices must be
accompanied by profound changes in thinking, otherwise we
continue to reinvent the past. Communication practice is informed
by the ontology of communication which is itself embedded within
other ontologies and epistemologies. The dominant paradigm of
communication is at present in a state of crisis, caught between two
views of communication power. On the one hand it displays an
obsession with instrumental effectiveness on which it cannot
deliver. On the other hand-in an attempt to discard the
accumulated baggage of dualist philosophy and mechanistic models
of effective communication-it indulges in a humourless critique of
language which, as Robert Hughes astutely observes, is little more
than an enclave of abstract complaint (Hughes 1993:72). This thesis
has been an attempt to open up a space for a new ontology, within
which we might create new possibilities.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">communication</field><field name="subject">mass media</field><field name="subject">public communication campaigns</field><field name="subject">Traffic Accident Commission</field><field name="subject">Victoria</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">TAC Road Safety Campaign</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20050601.163735</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Media and Thai civil society: case studies of television production companies, Watchdog and iTV</field><field name="creator">Suksai, Ousa</field><field name="description">The study concerns the inter-relationship between media reform and civil
society in Thailand between 1995-2000. It examines case studies of two selected
television organisations - the production company Watchdog and the broadcast
channel Independent Television (iTV) - and analyses their internal production
decision-making processes, their public affairs programs and their urban and rural
audiences.
Debates about civil society and media reform between 1995-2000 influenced
the government's media regulation policies to the extent that more attention was paid
to media freedom as intended by Articles 39, 40 and 41 in the 1997 Constitution.
Non-governmental Organisations (NGOs) took an important role in monitoring
government policies on media reform under the Constitution and issues about media
re-regulation and ownership were canvassed, although the drawn out National
Broadcasting Commission (NBC) selecting process delayed media reform. The
transparency of the selection process of the NBC has been widely debated among
NGOs, media scholars and media professionals. Most Thai public affairs programs in
the period were shown on iTV, Channel 9 and Channel 11 and were in the minority
compared with entertainment. Thai television stations normally screened
entertainment programs to make profits, while they usually would not allow producers
to air open debates critical of the government. Also, public affairs programs that were
screened often were given inappropriate airtimes.
Watchdog and iTV treated public affairs programs in different ways.
Watchdog, originating from an NCO, the Creative Media Foundation, emphasized
public participation in local community-oriented programs - such as Chirmsak
Pinthong's Lan Ban Lan Muang - which exemplified civic journalism on television.
In contrast, iTV was created in 1996 to meet the promise made in 1992 after Black
May that a non-state commercial channel would be introduced. It was organised by
journalists from the Nation Multimedia Company and focused on current national
news issues which seldom allowed public participation. Both organisations attempted
to maintain their professionalism despite political and business pressures. Chirmsak
and Watchdog were accused of bias favoring the Democrat Party and often
encountered program censorship. ITV staff, especially in the news department led by
Suthichai Yoon and Thepchai Yong, unsuccessful fought. Shin Corps 2000-2001
takeover of the station that had been brought on by the financial problems of iTV and
the Siam Commercial Bank after the economic crisis of 1997.
There were three main concepts of civil society in the period 1997-2000 -
Communitarianism, Self-sufficiency and Good Governance. These ideas were
advanced by reformers such as Dr. Prawase Wasi and Thirayut Boonme, and were
reinforced by His Majesty King Bhumibol's December 1997 Birthday Speech that
endorsed the ideal of national self-sufficiency. Thai civil society debates often were
involved with rural people, while the 8th National Development Plan and the Chuan
government's policy on decentralisation aimed to strengthen the rural sector as an
antidote to the 1997 crisis. However, the aims of civil society reformers were at times
too idealistic and were viewed with skepticism by some middle class urban critics.
The continuing influence of electoral corruption in rural areas also obstructed civil
society ideals, while decentralisation and community development still maintained a
top-down way of development and depended on government support.
These difficulties in implementing pro-civil society reforms in the political
process were paralleled by difficulties in developing public interest programs on Thai
television. Current affairs and investigative journalism programs, such as iTV Talk,
Tod Rahad and Krong Satanakarn, did not often open public discussion on the
programs. Rather, the regular format of panel discussions, consisting of elites and
some celebrities, tended to focus on national topics rather than local issues. The hosts
of many of these public affairs programs depended on their own celebrities status and
tended to invite well-known guests, whereas community-oriented programs such as
Lan Ban Lan Muang and Tid Ban Tang Muang promoted civic journalism and
deliberative democracy more effectively. The latter programs allowed the public to
participate in the programs as the main actors and even proposed their own agendas.

However, a limited study of three audience focus groups - an expert urban
group, a young middle class urban group, and a rural group - found considerable
scepticism about the possibility of developing public interest awareness via television
programs. The expert and young middle class groups criticised both the hosts and the
style of a selection of current affairs programs, which they thought were too serious
and also biased. Some also considered that current affairs programs were a platform
for the people in power rather than providing a space for the public. Therefore, they
rarely watched them. In contrast, the rural group who participated in Lan Ban Lan
Muang, believed that the program was useful for development communication. The
audience gained information about other communities and used the media as the
means to publicise their own community. However, they rarely watched it because
the airtime of the program was the same as a popular entertainment program on
Channel 3.
The researcher used qualitative research methods to collect data, including indepth
interviews, focus groups, participant observation, program recording and
document analysis. Theoretically, the study has attempted to combine the approaches
of western and Thai scholars. The main approach used to explain the relationship
between the media and civil society is media and public sphere theory, as introduced
by Habermas, and combined with the perspectives on media re-regulation of the Thai
scholar Ubonrat Siriyusak. In terms of analysing Watchdog and iTV, the researcher
used political economy perspectives to understand decision-making in both
organisations. In addition, an organisational culture approach was used to explore
conflicts of interest that arose in both organisations due to their different sub-cultures.
Civic journalism, framing theory and development communication theory were
further employed to examine the television programs and their roles in promoting the
public interest and development projects, while the audience groups were considered
in the context of participatory communication theory and reception theory.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">television production companies</field><field name="subject">Watchdog</field><field name="subject">Independent Television</field><field name="subject">iTV</field><field name="subject">media</field><field name="subject">civil society</field><field name="subject">Thailand</field><field name="subject">media reform</field><field name="subject">Creative Media Foundation</field><field name="subject">public affairs programs</field><field name="subject">Habermas</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20050602.143439</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Inference on the host status of feral ferrets (Mustela furo) in New Zealand for Mycobacterium bovis infection</field><field name="creator">Caley, Peter</field><field name="description">This thesis is about making inference on the host status of feral ferrets in New
Zealand for Mycobacterium bovis, the aetiological agent of bovine tuberculosis. The
central question addressed is whether the rate of intra-specific transmission of M. bovis
among ferrets is sufficient for the disease to persist in ferret populations in the absence
of external, non-ferret sources of infection (inter-specific transmission). The question is
tackled in three parts&#65533;firstly using model selection to identify suitable models for
estimating the force of M. bovis infection in ferret populations; secondly applying
statistical hypothesis testing to the results of planned manipulative field experiments to
test the relationship between M. bovis infection in brushtail possums and that in ferrets;
and thirdly using modelling to estimate intra-specific disease transmission rates and the
basic reproductive rate (Ro) of M. bovis infection in ferrets.
The model selection approach clearly identified the hypothesis of oral infection
related to diet was, as modelled by a constant force of infection from the age of
weaning, the best approximation of how M. bovis infection was transmitted to ferrets.
No other form of transmission (e.g., during fighting, mating, or routine social
interaction) was supported in comparison. The force of infection (&#955;) ranged from 0.14
yr-1 to 5.77 yr-1, and was significantly higher (2.2 times) in male than female ferrets.
Statistical hypothesis testing revealed transmission of M. bovis to ferrets
occurred from both brushtail possums and ferrets. The force of M. bovis infection in
ferrets was reduced by 88% (&#955;=0.3 yr-1 vs. &#955;=2.5 yr-1) at sites with reductions in the
population density of sympatric brushtail possum populations. A smaller decline in the
force of infection resulting from the lethal cross-sectional sampling of the ferret
populations was also demonstrated.
The modelling approach estimated the basic reproductive rate (Ro) of M. bovis
infection in ferrets in New Zealand to vary from 0.17 at the lowest population density
(0.5 km-2) recorded to 1.6 at the highest population density (3.4 km-2) recorded. The
estimates of Ro were moderately imprecise, with a coefficient of variation of 76%.
Despite this imprecision, the Ro for M. bovis infection in ferrets was significantly less
than unity for all North Island sites surveyed. Hence it is inferred ferrets are spillover
hosts (0&lt;Ro&lt;1) for M. bovis infection in these environments. That is, M. bovis infection
will progressively disappear from these ferret populations if the source of inter-specific
transmission is eliminated. The estimates of Ro for M. bovis infection in South Island
ferret populations were above one (the level required for disease establishment) for a
number (5/10) of populations, though the imprecision made it impossible to ascertain
whether Ro was significantly greater than one. The estimated threshold population
density (Kt) for disease establishment was 2.9 ferrets km-2. It is inferred that, given
sufficient population density (&gt;Kt), the rate of intra-specific transmission of M. bovis
among ferrets is sufficient for the disease to establish in ferrets in the absence of interspecific
transmission. In these areas, ferrets would be considered maintenance hosts for
the disease. Active management (e.g., density reduction or vaccination) of ferrets
would be required to eradicate M. bovis from ferret populations in these areas, in
addition to the elimination of sources of inter-specific transmission, particularly brushtail possums.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">feral ferrets</field><field name="subject">Mustela furo</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Mycobacterium bovis infection</field><field name="subject">bovine tuberculosis</field><field name="subject">brushtail possums</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20050621.140940</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Public Accounts Committee: pursuing probity and effeciency in the Australian Public Service: the origins, work, nature and purpose of the Commonwealth's Public Accounts Committee</field><field name="creator">Laver, John Poynton</field><field name="description">The Commonwealth parliament's Public Accounts Committee (PAC) was established
in 1913 and to the end of 1995 had produced 397 reports on government expenditure
and administration, with almost all its recommendations implemented by government.
However despite the Committee's prominence among the instruments parliament
has used to oversight the executive, not only does it lack clear legislative authority
for major areas of its activities but its specific purpose is not defined in its legislation.
Among other things the latter omission renders proper evaluation of the PAC's
effectiveness impossible, as objectives are a necessary prerequisite to assessment.
This thesis establishes the de facto purpose of the Committee by tracing the
development of standing public accounts committees generally, and by analysing
the PAC's work as shown by its output of tabled reports.
In that development, six evolutionary phases are identified:
the PAC's roots in the move to a parliamentary control of the administration of
government expenditure in Britain from the 1780s;
its genesis in the 1850s with the concept of the standing public accounts
committee, to be concerned with regularity and probity in government
expenditure;
its origins in the establishment of the British standing public accounts committee ,
in 1861, stressing high standards of government accounting, audit and reporting;
its establishment in the Commonwealth, concentrating on information on
departmental activities, efficient implementation of government programs and
provision of policy advice;
its re-establishment in 1951, stressing parliamentary control of government
financial administration; and
its operations from 1980, pressing for economic fundamentalist change in the
public sector.
Their output shows that in these phases the committees concerned displayed
characteristic standing public accounts committee activism and independence in
utilising the wording of their enabling documentation to adapt themselves to changes
in their environment by pursuing a corresponding different mix of one or more of
the following concurrent immediate aims:
ensuring adequate systems of government accounting, audit and reporting;
ensuring probity and regularity in departmental expenditure;
obtaining and disseminating information on departmental activities;
ensuring high standards of departmental administration and management;
providing policy advice to executive government; and
ensuring economic, efficient and effective government spending.
Together these attributes and practices have made the PAC a parliamentary instrument
of unequalled flexibility with a single continuing underlying aim - a purpose not
concerning the public accounts per se, but directed at achieving high standards of
management and administration in government by calling the Commonwealth's public
service to account for its expenditure and activities.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australian Commonwealth Parliament</field><field name="subject">Public Accounts Committee</field><field name="subject">probity</field><field name="subject">efficiency</field><field name="subject">PAC</field><field name="subject">Commonwealth Public Service</field><field name="subject">Australian Public Service</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20050621.150413</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of cultural fitness in user resistance to information technology tools</field><field name="creator">Gobbin, Renzo</field><field name="description">Human interactions with Information Technology tools are reproducing organisational

to make to library strategic planning? If they do, what mechanisms will permit them to participate effectively in this
planning process?
To address these questions research was carried out in two stages at a single institutional site, the Canberra College
of Advanced Education. The first of these utilised a structured group discussion process, Nominal Group Technique
(NGT). This was used both as an indicator of user planning priorities and as a pilot research technique contributing to
the design of a subsequent survey. This survey obtained a response rate of over 90 percent from a sample of 379.
The study attempted to establish that academic staff and students do have a worthwhile input to make to planning by
testing for congruence between the rankings of library planning priorities of these user groups and the rankings of
planning priorities of Library staff. No strong positive correlations were established between the priorities of student
groups and Library staff, although in the survey the priorities of academic staff and Library staff were found to be
related. These results suggest users do have a worthwhile input to make to library strategic planning. Other tests for
congruence were also applied between and within respondent groups, because if a group was found to have different
priorities there would be a prima facie case for consulting members of that group as part of the planning process.
Both mechanisms used in the present study were considered successful. User surveys have been employed for
planning in previous studies with a future-oriented component. However, it appears that this may have been the first
formally reported application of NGT to library management. Experience in the present study suggests it is a highly
suitable technique for situations such as strategic planning, where generation of ideas or comment on priorities is
required.
However, an attempt to establish congruence between the results obtained using NGT and those obtained from the
survey yielded inconclusive results. It is believed that major changes in the institutional environment were principally
responsible for this, although a methodological limitation may also have contributed.
The study concludes with suggestions for further research.</field><field name="date">1988</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Academic library strategic planning</field><field name="subject">students</field><field name="subject">academic staff</field><field name="subject">library staff</field><field name="subject">Canberra College of Advanced Education</field><field name="subject">CCAE</field><field name="subject">University of Canberra</field><field name="subject">library users</field><field name="subject">congruence</field><field name="subject">user involvement</field><field name="subject">consultation</field><field name="subject">Nominal Group Technique</field><field name="subject">NGT</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20050627.142122</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Accuracy of Time-to-Contact Estimation
in the Prediction Motion Paradigm</field><field name="creator">Pei, Jiantao</field><field name="description">This thesis is concerned with the accuracy of our estimation of time to make contact
with an approaching object as measured by the &#8220;Prediction Motion&#8221; (PM) technique.
The PM task has commonly been used to measure the ability to judge time to contact
(TTC). In a PM task, the observer's view of the target is occluded for some period
leading up to the moment of impact. The length of the occlusion period is varied and
the observer signals the moment of impact by pressing a response key. The interval
separating the moment of occlusion and the response is interpreted as the observer's
estimate of TTC made at the moment of occlusion. This technique commonly
produces large variability and systematic underestimation. The possibility that this
reflects genuine perceptual errors has been discounted by most writers, since this
seems inconsistent with the accuracy of interceptive actions in real life. Instead, the
poor performance in the PM task has been attributed to problems with the PM
technique. Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain the poor PM
performance. The motion extrapolation hypothesis asserts that some form of mental
representation of the occluded part of the trajectory is used to time the PM response;
the errors in PM performance are attributed to errors in reconstructing the target
motion. The clocking hypothesis assumes that the TTC is accurately perceived at the
moment of occlusion and that errors arise in delaying the response for the required
period. The fear-of-collision hypothesis proposes that the underestimation seen in
the PM tasks reflects a precautionary tendency to anticipate the estimated moment of
contact. This thesis explores the causes of the errors in PM measurements.
Experiments 1 and 2 assessed the PM performance using a range of motion scenarios
involving various patterns of movement of the target, the observer, or both. The
possible contribution of clocking errors to the PM performance was assessed by a
novel procedure designed to measure errors in the wait-and-respond component of
the PM procedure. In both experiments, this procedure yielded a pattern of
systematic underestimation and high variability similar to that in the TTC estimation
task. Experiment 1 found a small effect of motion scenario on TTC estimation.
However, this was not evident in Experiment 2.
The collision event simulated in Experiment 2 did not involve a solid collision. The
target was simply a rectangular frame marked on a tunnel wall. At the moment of
&#8220;contact&#8221;, the observers passed &#8220;through&#8221; the target without collision. However,
there was still systematic underestimation of TTC and there was little difference
between the estimates obtained in Experiments 1 and 2. Overall, the results of
Experiments 1 and 2 were seen as inconsistent with either the motion extrapolation
hypothesis or the fear-of-collision hypothesis. It was concluded that observers

extracted an estimate of the TTC based on optic TTC information at a point prior to
the moment of collision, and used a timing process to count down to the moment of
response. The PM errors were attributed to failure in this timing process. The results
of these experiments were seen as implying an accurate perception of TTC.
It was considered possible that in Experiments 1 and 2 observers based their TTC
judgements on either the retinal size or the expansion rate of the target rather than
TTC. Experiments 3 and 4 therefore investigated estimation of TTC using a range of
simulated target velocities and sizes. TTC estimates were unaffected by the resulting
variation in expansion rate and size, indicating that TTC, rather than retinal size or
image expansion rate per se, was used to time the observers' response.
The accurate TTC estimation found in Experiments 1-4 indicates that the TTC
processing is very robust across a range of stimulus conditions. Experiment 5 further
explored this robustness by requiring estimation of TTC with an approaching target
which rotated in the frontoparallel plane. It was shown that moderate but not fast
rates of target rotation induced an overestimation of TTC. However, observers were
able to discriminate between TTCs for all rates of rotation. This shows that the
extraction of TTC information is sensitive to perturbation of the local motion of the
target border, but it implies that, in spite of these perturbations, the mechanism is
flexible enough to pick up the optic TTC information provided by the looming of the
retinal motion envelop of the rotating stimulus.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">time to contact</field><field name="subject">TTC</field><field name="subject">Prediction Motion</field><field name="subject">PM</field><field name="subject">anticipation</field><field name="subject">moment till impact</field><field name="subject">psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20050627.143329</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation into the use of digital techology to manage deteriorating cellulose acetate negatives</field><field name="creator">Leggio, Angeletta</field><field name="description">This thesis aims to examine the issues involved in utilising digital images and
assess whether image processing techniques can be used as a cost-effective
method of reconstructing the image found in a deteriorated cellulose acetate
negative.
Negatives affected by the vinegar syndrome are found in large numbers within
Australian institutions. This was confirmed by a survey (using a questionnaire)
undertaken at the National Library of Australia in 2000. The survey also found
that although these collections are large, and hence the level of deterioration
variable, little could be done to restore any of the negatives once deterioration had
begun.
Storing negatives at low temperature and low relative humidity slows down the
breakdown of cellulose acetate; however, it cannot reverse the process once it has
commenced. Although removing the gelatine pellicular from the deteriorated
cellulose acetate support (making the image easier to view) a possible method of
restoration, this becomes unfeasible when dealing with a large collection. As a
result, how to manage cellulose acetate negatives once they have deteriorated
becomes problematic.
Image-processing techniques used to digitally restore these negatives were
examined via a series of case studies. These examinations were undertaken using
two software packages-the Image Processing Tool kit (IPTK) and OPTIMAS.
Deteriorated cellulose acetate negatives were scanned, then a number of program
filters were applied to the digital image to determine whether disfiguring elements
(referred to as channelling elements) resulting from the deteriorated support could
be digitally removed.
IPTK and OPTIMAS were not completely successful in removing the deteriorated
elements from the digital version. The results highlighted that a number of issues
relating to the use of digital technology needed to be addressed. These issues
included knowledge of basic technical terms, an understanding of digital
language, and how to include the use of digital technology into a long-term
strategy for archiving a digitised collection.
This thesis showed that issues relating to utilising digital systems could be
addressed by implementing a preservation management plan. A preservation
management plan can be used to incorporate the goals of digitising, the long-term
issues of retaining digital files, ongoing access relating to the digital file, hardware
and software, and the importance of having the relevant expertise when
undertaking such a project.

has stimulated much discussion about their potential to assist in the renewal of democracy.
Globalisation, intimately connected with technological advance, has likewise led to
considerations of 'governance' that transcend the nation state. This thesis poses the general
question: Can the efficiencies and economies which drive commercial applications of
interactive technology be applied to democratic policy processes? What conditions will
facilitate this?
The perspective taken here views policy as a communication process between networks of
actors who seek to use resources and decisions to promote their value systems (Considine
1994). Democracy is also seen as a communication process, with a set of criteria which
ensure equal access to information and agenda setting among participants (Dahl 1989).
These definitions and criteria have been chosen for their generality. They apply at all levels
of analysis, and thus may be used for comparison across scales. These are aligned with
concepts from complexity theory as applied to human nonlinear systems and organisational
dynamics, drawing mostly on Kiel(1994) and Stacey (1996). The inherent unpredictability
of these systems and their capacity for complex learning and adaptive self-organisation
offers an alternative paradigm to linear, hierarchical management models.
A combination of literature analysis and case study evidence leads to three extensions of
complexity theory as applied to human systems: Firstly, interactive technology is proposed
as a technique for the potential re-pluralisation of democratic processes in complex human
systems. The possibility of adding many new non-elite voices, and of making these available
to all others, relates to both chaotic forms of self-organisation and the benefits of electronic
democracy. Secondly, evidence is presented for the existence of fractal, or self-similar
patterns in the ways information technology is applied at different levels of governance. It is
shown that instrumental approaches which emphasise efficiency dominate technology use at
the global, national and organisational levels, and these are interdependent. Alternative
patterns which encourage participation also exist at every level. Thirdly, it is argued that the
values of the dominant actors are the main determinants of whether interactive technologies
will be structured to favour democratic forms of communication at every level.
Three theory chapters in Part I develop these arguments by extensive reviews of relevant
literatures. On the global level, convergent media, telecommunications and technology
conglomerates underpin a global 'nervous system' which discourages government
intervention, promotes a global monoculture, inhibits pluralistic debate by minimising access
to alternative forms of information, and emphasises individualism and consumption. Within
nations, widespread uniformity of public sector reform is sympathetic and responsive to
these globalising pressures. Deregulation, privatisation, retreat from public broadcasting,
down-sizing and outsourcing have become standard approaches, and are reflected in
Australian information technology policy and programs. Several exceptions demonstrate
more participatory approaches. At the organisational level, instrumental approaches to
management and computerisation also prevail. In each case, a shift towards globalising
values corresponds to applications of information technology which dampen the complex
interactivity required for democratic policy processes.
Part II supplements this analysis with case study evidence. The organisational data were
collected primarily during a two year qualitative study of interactive technology use in the
Australian Department of Finance and Administration. The researcher found technology use
was inseparable from other change processes, and these were found to have strong elements
inhibiting participation in internal policy. An instrumental approach to interactive technology
use reinforced hierarchical decision processes.
Three minor case studies looked at an internal mailing list in a federal agency, a mostly
national list on Internet and telecommunications policy, and an experiment in electronic
democracy at the local level. These offered additional insights into the ways interactive
technologies can contribute to complex but adaptive policy processes, if normative
democratic values guide their design.
The researcher proposes a set of communication protocols for the use of interactive
technologies in democratic policy processes. These would enable the forms of
communication necessary to reinvigorate democracy in an information age. It is also argued
that these protocols, if applied at the organisational level, and particularly within the public
sector, could become part of a reaffirmation of industrial democracy. This is necessary to
ensure the integrity and accountability of the public sector, given the progressive
intermingling of these institutions with private enterprise. Additional suggestions are made
for research into government uses of information technology as an important focus for policy
analysts.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">democracy</field><field name="subject">interactive technology</field><field name="subject">fractal modelling</field><field name="subject">democratic policy processes</field><field name="subject">communication</field><field name="subject">Australian Dept of Finance and Administration</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20050628.122941</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Measuring electronic information systems: the use of the information behaviour model</field><field name="creator">Cheng, Grace Y. T.</field><field name="description">This study focused on measuring the importance and contribution of information obtained from the
library, particularly electronic information services (EIS), to success in solving clinical problems in
hospitals. Three research questions with three main hypotheses were advanced and tested on clinicians
in 44 hospitals in Hong Kong. The findings were tested against the framework from Wilson's (1996)
existing general information behaviour model, from which a new extended model for clinicians was
built. Measures of EIS were then derived from the new model.
The research was broadly divided into a series of five studies in two stages: nominal group,
quantitative survey, and interviews in the first stage, and randomized controlled study as well as the
analyses of statistical data and computer transaction logs in the second stage. The key results in Stage I
led to the studies in Stage 11. The randomized controlled study in Stage 11 attempted to reduce the
barriers identified in the information environment, with a view to test the results of an educational
intervention, and to confirm that the hypotheses were true given reduced barriers and the presence of
enabling conditions. The effects of the interventions in this experimental study were validated and
verified by statistical data and transaction logs.
Corroborative evidence from the two-stage studies showed that the three main inter-connected
hypotheses were supported: success in problem-solving is related to the information sources used; user
satisfaction is related to success in problem-solving; and EIS use is an indicator of user satisfaction.
EIS use is determined by a number of factors: the preference for EIS, the use of the library, the skills
and knowledge in searching, the profession of the user and the characteristics of the work environment.
Educational intervention was found to improve success in problem-solving, the attitudes, skills and
knowledge in searching, the satisfaction with and use of EIS, and is an important enabling condition.
The research rejected part of the first hypothesis posed that success in problem-solving is related to
clinical question posed and suggests that further research is needed in this area.
The study supported the extension of the general model to clinical information needs and
behaviours and found new relationships. The study found an additional determinant of EIS
satisfaction, the satisfaction with the information obtained. EIS satisfaction would not be changed by
educational intervention alone if the information obtained was not satisfactory. On the other hand,
education can improve EIS satisfaction regardless of whether the problem has been solved. Of critical
importance is the time factor in determining the use (or non-use) of EIS. There is new evidence that
the awareness of the user of an answer in literature is a determining factor for active searching.
Borrowing the concept of opportunity cost from economic theory, the researcher relates it with the
differing levels of self-efficacy and postulates a model for planning EIS and related library services.
From the new extended model of information behaviour, sixteen main measures or indicators
were tested on a proposed framework in developing performance measures to diagnose information
behaviours and predict EIS use, satisfaction and success in problem-solving. In measuring EIS, the
researcher suggested the holistic approach in assessing traditional (non-electronic) library and
information services as part of information behaviours of clinicians. The study pointed to the
imbalance between self-efficacy and the actual skills and knowledge of users in their searching
mentality and activities and the implication for library practice. Qualitative aspects that require further
research on measurement were suggested.
The study has important ramifications for theory and practice for the information professional.
The new extended model of information behaviour for clinicians establishes deterministic relationships
that help explain why an information search is pursued actively, continuously, or not at all. Measures
that have been derived from these relationships can help diagnose and predict information behaviours.
The study highlights the flexibility and utility of the general model of information behaviour. Also,
this is the first time that such a methodological approach has been adopted to derive EIS measures.
The application of the randomized controlled study methodology in information science was proven to

communication between the Operations branch, the Student Services
Section and High School Learning Centres within the Services Division of
the ACT Department of Education.
Data was collected from administrators and educators alike. The survey
instrument was designed specifically to examine the perception of the
effectiveness of organisational communication between the bureaucratic
administrative group within the ACT Department Education Department
and the personnel within the ACT High Schools Learning Centres
responsible for service delivery to students in Learning Centres. The
survey instrument addressed five factors. These factors included
Horizontal and Vertical Communication, Personal Feedback, Media Quality
and Barriers to Communication.
The findings from the survey were organised into six major findings and
four subsidiary findings and discussion on each finding followed.
The findings of the study indicated that, effective co-ordination in a large
organisation requires some centralized direction. The relationship that
exists between the three organisational domains of the Act Department of
Education responsible for the delivery of effective service to Learning
Centre clients in ACT High Schools had been shown to be an impersonal
mechanism of control designed by the Policy and Management domains in
part, and a culturally diffuse but personal mechanism of control used by
the Service domain personnel within the Learning Centres themselves.
What has emerged from the study is evidence that would suggest that there
is lack of an effective link between the more bureaucratic Policy and
Management domains and the more open and less formal Service domain
sector.
The findings have implications for the bureaucrats involved in the change
process which has been part of regionalisation. The findings of the study
indicate that regionalisation does not appear to provide a panacea for the
major difficulties associated with communication as revealed in this
study.</field><field name="date">1991</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">learning centres</field><field name="subject">ACT high schools</field><field name="subject">Australian Capital territory</field><field name="subject">ACT Dept of Education</field><field name="subject">education</field><field name="subject">communication</field><field name="subject">organisational communication</field><field name="subject">service delivery</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20050629.095537</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Information needs of external students: a survey of the information needs of external students enrolled at the South Australian College of Advanced Education and resident in Whyalla, South Australia</field><field name="creator">Ledo, Wietske</field><field name="description">The main purpose of the study was to investigate the library needs
and library usage of external students in remote areas. The study emphasised
external students' perception of their own library needs. Four distinct areas
of research evolved from the purpose of the study: to identify the library
service needs of external students; to identify library use by external
students; to identify external students' perceptions of library needs; and to
identify student status in relation to library use.
Information was collected by an interview with former external
students, a questionnaire to the libraries involved in the study and by
Nominal Group Technique (NGT) sessions with external students. The
primary instrument was a questionnaire to the external students in the
population under investigation requesting information of their library
usage and needs.
The population under investigation were external students enrolledin the South Australian College of Advanced Education (SACAE) and
resident in Whyalla, South Australia. It was decided to survey the total
population rather than a sample because of the small numbers involved.
Thirty-five responses were received out of a population of 52, representing a
response rate of 69 percent.
The results of the survey were analysed using a Statview SE statistical
package and a spreadsheet and graphics package, Excel. Frequency
distributions were computed to determine the number of respondents who
selected each option.
The study found that the external students who used libraries tended
to use a variety of libraries. Students used not only their own institution's
library, but the a range of libraries accessible to them in Whyalla.
The study concludes by identifying issues, recommending possible
solutions, and identifying areas for further research.</field><field name="date">1993</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">external students</field><field name="subject">South Australian College of Advanced Education</field><field name="subject">SACAE</field><field name="subject">Whyalla</field><field name="subject">information needs</field><field name="subject">library usage</field><field name="subject">remote areas</field><field name="subject">Nominal Group Technique</field><field name="subject">NGT</field><field name="subject">library needs</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20050629.113625</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The validation of physiological field testing
in elite orienteers</field><field name="creator">Rattray, Benjamin</field><field name="description">The complex physiology of orienteering performance is not well understood but recent
advances in technology allow for more in-depth investigation. The purpose of this
study was to develop and validate physiological field tests for elite orienteers in
Australia.
Seven male and three female elite orienteers volunteered to take part in the study.
Subjects completed an incremental fixed-distance (803m) trial in Australian forest
terrain, paced by a bicycle equipped with a speedometer. This was replicated in the
laboratory using a 4.5% grade for treadmill running. Subjects also completed four
(males) or three (females) laps of a 1340m terrain loop incorporating uphill, track and
downhill sections. Subjects then repeated this test in the laboratory, with treadmill grade
manipulated to replicate the gradient profile of each section. Heart rate (HR) and
oxygen uptake (VCh) were recorded continuously with telemetry during each stage/lap.
Blood [La] and RPE were recorded after each stage/lap.
In the incremental tests, no significant differences (p=0.05 level) were observed in HR,
VO2, blood [La] or RPE between the Field test, and its Laboratory replication over the
entire range of speeds tested. The actual speeds run during the Field tests were
significantly faster than the Laboratory test at the slowest speed (8 kmh- 1 ) attempted,
and slower at the fastest speed (18 km-h-1) attempted. In the time-trial tests, no
significant differences were observed in HR, VO2, blood [La] or RPE between the
Field test and its Laboratory replication. The running speeds in the Field tests were
significantly slower than the Laboratory tests. Running speed appeared inversely
related to the course profile and the terrain also affected the speeds that could be
achieved. Despite the changes in the course profile, the physiological responses to the
course were maintained within a narrow range at a high level (-95% of maximal heart
rate, 80-90% of VO2max, blood [La] -10 mM) for the duration of the 20-25 minute test.
The Field tests that were developed in this study for elite orienteers in Australian forest
terrain were successfully validated by replicating the protocols in a Laboratory setting.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">complex physiology</field><field name="subject">orienteering performance</field><field name="subject">elite orienteers</field><field name="subject">physiological field testing</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20050629.113059</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of the perceptions of actual and ideal role responsibility of College librarians as held by principals, College Librarians and senior library staff in Colleges of Advanced Education in New South Wales</field><field name="creator">Williamson, Vicki</field><field name="description">This study was designed to ascertain, analyse and compare the perceptions of College
Librarians and their associates about the role responsibility which College Librarians in
libraries in New South Wales Colleges of Advanced Education (CAEs) were actually
assuming and ideally should be assuming as part of their role as library managers.
Using as its basis a theoretical framework of role and role-related concepts, as developed
by social psychologists such as Kahn et al. (1964), a role set group of Principals,
Registrars and Senior Library Staff was identified as the survey population.
A review of the literature about CAEs and their libraries and overseas studies about the
role of library managers assisted with the development of a role responsibility
questionnaire.
Data from the questionnaire was analysed in respect of actual and ideal role responsibility
and any gaps between actual and ideal role responsibility. Gaps between perceptions of
actual and ideal role responsibility between College Librarians and associates may
indicate a potential for role conflict for persons enacting the role of College Librarian.
This study found statistically significant results in respect of both actual and ideal role
responsibility between College Librarians and Senior Library Staff, which indicated that
there was not clear agreement between the two groups about either the role responsibility
currently assumed by College Librarians and that which ideally should be assumed. In
respect of the gap between actual and ideal role responsibility, however, there was no
statistically significant result between College Librarians and associates, indicating that
the potential for role conflict resulting from divergent perceptions between role set groups
was not evident. This does not preclude the potential for role conflict from other sources.</field><field name="date">1990</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">role responsibilities</field><field name="subject">college librarians</field><field name="subject">Colleges of Advanced Education</field><field name="subject">New South Wales</field><field name="subject">Kahn</field><field name="subject">CAE</field><field name="subject">principals</field><field name="subject">perceptions</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20050629.141005</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of best practice design guidelines and the development of a usability analysis tool for the evaluation of Australian academic library web
sites</field><field name="creator">Raward, Roslyn</field><field name="description">The library profession is now heavily involved in providing access to
information through library web sites and it is a challenge to design a web
site that has reliable content and a user interface that is intuitive to those
who use it. As web accessibility and usability are major issues in the design
of library Web sites, this paper suggests that the design will be most
successful when a usability analysis tool is used throughout the design and
redesign of academic library web sites.
The research drew on the literature of Human-computer Interaction and
usability engineering examining best practice usability and accessibility
design guidelines. It identified those guidelines that were relevant to
academic library web sites. In order to establish the extent to which
Australian academic library web sites met usability guidelines a usability
analysis tool was developed and used to evaluate a randomly selected
sample of web sites. The web sites were categorised under higher education
institutional archetypes as suggested by DETYA (1998) and the results
were discussed in light of these groups. The research found that there was
no correlation of the usability of the web sites between the archetypes. In
fact the pattern of usability was randomly distributed across all institutions,
with the best and worst results appearing in each archetypical category. The
study concluded that the web has provided a whole new start for all
institutions and after examining the results, it suggested that the design of
early web sites was not based on the size or the past history of the
institution that it belonged to, but rather reflected those factors, already
established in the literature, that faced library web managers at that time,
when designing the library web page.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">best practice</field><field name="subject">usability</field><field name="subject">internet</field><field name="subject">new media</field><field name="subject">web page</field><field name="subject">library web page</field><field name="subject">academic</field><field name="subject">usability guidelines</field><field name="subject">Human-computer Interaction</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20050629.133643</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Trainee and beginning teacher attitude and value conflict in the socialisation process</field><field name="creator">Morey, Bruce E</field><field name="description">The study is concerned with the process of socialisation
of teachers in the teaching profession. Drawing on
socialisation theory the study sees the process of
secondary socialisation in teacher preparation as
building skills and enabling personal development. It was
predicted that in the transition from the training
institution to the first years of teaching, the degree of
job satisfaction and commitment to teaching would be
related to the degree of conflict experienced and that
job satisfaction and commitment would be less for
beginning teachers compared with that anticipated by
trainees. Conflict was seen as appropriately measured
by the difference between personal professional attitudes
and occupational values one the one hand and the
professional attitudes and occupational values perceived
to be held by senior teachers on the other.
Seventy-three final year trainee teachers at the Canberra
College of Advanced Education and 47 beginning teachers
in their first two years of teaching in Canberra primary
and secondary schools, were selected as the sample.
Previously validated instruments were used in a questionnaire.
The findings clearly showed the existence of conflict
between personal professional attitudes and occupational
values and the perceived professional attitudes and
occupational values of senior teachers. The difference
in conflict between trainees and beginning teachers was
small and tended to decrease. However, there was a marked
increase in variance of conflict scores for women conpared
to men. For women also, conflict was highly related to
job satisfaction.
Thc findings suggested that men tend to be more
homogeneous in their adaptation to teaching and
are more inclined to be satisfied and committed despite
holding professional attitudes and occupational
values which conflict with those of senior teachers.
The study discusses some of the imlications of
the findings for the training institution and
the importance, particularly for women teachers,
of coping with conflict in the teaching situation.</field><field name="date">1977</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">trainee teachers</field><field name="subject">beginning teachers</field><field name="subject">professional attitudes</field><field name="subject">value conflict</field><field name="subject">socialisation</field><field name="subject">socialisation process</field><field name="subject">teaching</field><field name="subject">education</field><field name="subject">Canberra College of Advanced Education</field><field name="subject">CCAE</field><field name="subject">ACT Education</field><field name="subject">Canberra primary schools</field><field name="subject">Canberra secondary schools</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20050629.165201</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Understanding Chinese educational leaders' conceptions of learning and leadership in an international education context</field><field name="creator">Wang, Ting</field><field name="description">This thesis presents an interpretative study of an Australian offshore education program
in educational leadership conducted at Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province in China from
2002 to 2003. It is a study of the influence of international education on the conceptions
of the participants in a particular context, where Chinese culture and Western cultures
came into contact. The study is significant because it investigated a relatively new
aspect of international education, offshore education, this time from the perspective of
the participants. It explored the conceptions of learning and leadership brought by a
group of Chinese educational leaders to the course and investigated the perceived
influence of the course upon their conceptions and self-reported leadership practice. It
employed a culturally sensitive approach which recognizes that a complex interaction
between Chinese and Western cultures is occurring in the participants of this study.
This interpretative study was inspired by the phenomenographic approach.
Phenomenography is an approach to research that has been used to help understand the
key aspects of the variations in the experiences of groups of people (Marton &amp; Booth,
1997). The study examined the experiences and understandings about learning and
leadership of Chinese leaders in an offshore program, a Master of Educational
Leadership. The program was delivered in a flexible mode in three intensive teaching
brackets of six subjects. The study employed a semi-structured and in-depth interview
technique. Twenty participants were interviewed twice over a 12-month period. The
study sought a better understanding of their conceptions by making a comparison
between their perceptions prior to and after undertaking the course. Participants were
from schools, universities and educational departments. Potential differences across the
three sectors were also considered in the analysis.
The findings showed that most participants developed more complex understandings of
learning and leadership throughout the course. Comparison of conceptions prior to and
after the course indicated an expanded range of conceptions. There was reportedly a
movement towards more complex and diversified perspectives. Prior to the course,
participants reported comparatively traditional conceptions of learning and leadership in
quite a limited range. Learning experience and exposure to Western educational ideas
and practices seems to have led participants to reflect on their inherited assumptions and to expand their conceptions. They generally increased their awareness of key aspects of
variations in learning and leadership. This study identified a general shift from
content/utilitarian-oriented learning conceptions to meaning/developmental-oriented
conceptions after undertaking the course. There was also a shift from task/directiveorientated
conceptions about leadership to motivation/collaborative-oriented leadership
conceptions. Many participants reported that they expanded their leadership practice
after the course. The findings also revealed some differences regarding conceptual and
practice changes across the three sectors.
The study contributes to understanding of learning and leadership in an international
education context. The learning and leadership conceptions and self-reported practices
are context and culture dependent. The study illustrates the tensions between different
cultural forces in the process of teaching and learning. The methodology which explores
the subjective understandings of participants renders more complex understandings of
intercultural processes than cross-cultural comparisons which have been predominant in
the educational leadership field in the past. The results highlight the need for
appreciation of local contexts in designing international programs. The discussion
questions the universal applicability and transferability of Western ideas, and also
highlights the importance of critical reflection and adaptation on the part of educational
practitioners from non-Western cultures. It highlights the potential for growth of change
in both providers and recipients of international education as a result of very different
cultures and traditions coming into contact. Intercultural dialogue and integration of
educational ideas and practices are likely to come about when East meets West in an
open and reflective dialogue.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">learning</field><field name="subject">Chinese educational leaders</field><field name="subject">international education</field><field name="subject">offshore education</field><field name="subject">Hanzhou</field><field name="subject">Zhejiang Province</field><field name="subject">China</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Chinese culture</field><field name="subject">Western culture</field><field name="subject">phenomenography</field><field name="subject">intercultural processes</field><field name="subject">cros-cultural comparisons</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20050630.090724</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A History of the Sydney and Melbourne Film Festivals, 1945-1972: negotiating between culture and industry</field><field name="creator">Hope, Cathy</field><field name="description">This thesis is a history of the Sydney and Melbourne International Film Festivals, and covers the years from 1945 to 1972.

The thesis begins with a consideration of the origins of the Festivals in the post-war period &#65533;with the attempts by non-Hollywood producers to break into the cinema market, the collapse of the &#65533;mass audience&#65533;, and the growth of the film society movement in Australia. The thesis then examines the establishment in the early 1950s of the Sydney and Melbourne Festivals as small, amateur events, run by and for film enthusiasts. It then traces the Festivals&#65533; historical development until 1972, by which time both Festivals had achieved an important status as social and cultural organisations within Australia. The main themes dealt with throughout this period of development include the Festivals&#65533; difficult negotiations with both the international and domestic film trade, their ongoing internal debates over their role and purpose as cultural organisations, their responses to the appearance of other international film festivals in Australia, their relation to the Australian film industry, and their fight to liberalise Australia&#65533;s film censorship regulations.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sydney Film Festival</field><field name="subject">Melbourne Film Festival</field><field name="subject">1945-1972</field><field name="subject">culture</field><field name="subject">industry</field><field name="subject">history</field><field name="subject">cinema</field><field name="subject">films</field><field name="subject">international film trade</field><field name="subject">domestic film trade</field><field name="subject">film censorship</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20050630.130907</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The house enshrined: the great man and social history house museums in the United States and Australia</field><field name="creator">Smith, Charlotte H.F.</field><field name="description">This thesis is a study of the origins and rationale of two categories of house
museum - here named "Great Man" and "Social History" - in the United States
and Australia. An examination of cultural, social and historical change provides
the context for the genres' evolution.
The Great Man genre was born in mid nineteenth-century America when two
houses associated with George Washington - Hasbrouck House and Mount
Vernon - were preserved and translated to museum status. Mount Vernon quickly
became the exemplar for house museums.
Civil religion, a secular nationalism that adopted the forms and rituals of church
religion, focusing on hero worship, pilgrimage and contemplation of transcendent
collective purpose, provided the ideology that sustained the new museum type.
Great Man house museums became the shrines at which such rituals could be
practiced.
In the early twentieth-century the specialization of heritage organizations
encouraged a new breed of heritage professional. Largely fabric focused, these
"new museum men" influenced philosophy, management and conservation
practice at house museums throughout the century.
Social history made its impact upon house museums in the latter decades of the
twentieth century. The paradigm encouraged the creation of a new category of
house museum. Existing Great Man house museums adopted some of its
characteristics though never lost their hero worship foundations. In fact, I posit
that the idea of hero worship was transferred to the new genre.
The birth and evolution of the two categories of house museum is demonstrated
through four biographical studies: Vaucluse House in Sydney; Monticello in
Charlottesville VA; the Lower East Side Tenement Museum in New York City;
and Susannah Place Museum in Sydney. I believe the findings demonstrate an
argument that applies at hundreds of house museums in the United States and
Australia.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">great man</field><field name="subject">new museum men</field><field name="subject">social history</field><field name="subject">Hasbrouck House</field><field name="subject">Mount Vernon</field><field name="subject">religion</field><field name="subject">ideology</field><field name="subject">ritual</field><field name="subject">specailization</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20050701.140057</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Product information management in concurrent design systems</field><field name="creator">Tan, Ah Kat</field><field name="description">In this thesis, the management of product information in concurrent design
systems has been investigated with particular reference to product
development in small and medium enterprise (SME) industry and design
education at polytechnic level in Singapore. From a critical review of the
relevant literature on product design and development processes,
concurrent engineering, concurrent design systems, product data
management and related methods, it is found that there is a clear need for a
new design of a system for organizing and managing product information
in a concurrent design environment in the above contexts. This finding has
led to the development of a conceptual rationale, termed the Design Tensor
Method, and the design and development of an innovative product
information management system called PRIMAS. PRIMAS is a systematic
methodology for the classification, organization, integration,
communication, storage and management of product information in the
product development process. A software prototype based on PRIMAS has
been subsequently developed. PRIMAS along with its conceptual principles
have been applied and tested in a product design project in a tertiary
educational institution and in two significant industrial product
development projects based respectively in two SMEs. Positive evaluation
feedback on PRIMAS has been obtained in these studies. The product
development projects investigated with PRIMAS have also produced
outcomes that meet the original specified design requirements. The
findings from this research have led to the conclusion that PRIMAS is a
viable product information management system that can be used effectively
for managing product information in concurrent design projects in SME
industry and design education. Substantial PRIMAS databases of useful
product information have been compiled for the product development
projects investigated with PRIMAS. Finally, recommendations are made for
future research.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">systems</field><field name="subject">management</field><field name="subject">concurrent design</field><field name="subject">polytechnic level</field><field name="subject">signapore</field><field name="subject">concurrent engineering</field><field name="subject">PRIMAS</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20050707.092604</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Regolith and landscape evolution of a low relief landscape: Cobar, Central New South Wales, Australia</field><field name="creator">Spry, Melissa J.</field><field name="description">Construction of a 1:250,000 scale regolith-landform map of the Cobar area of central New
South Wales (NSW) Australia, demonstrates the presence of a wide range of previously undescribed
regolith materials, landforms and landscape features in the region. The map covers the east-west extent
of the Cobar Basin, extends to the west onto the Darling River Floodplain, and east onto rocks of the
Girilambone Group. The mapping area is centred on the Cobar township and covers -14,730 krn2
between 303113 and 446113 E and 6483184 and 6586183 N (AGO 66, MGA Zone 55). 48 regolithlandform
units have been identified, including both transported (alluvial, colluvial, aeolian, lacustrine)
and in situ materials. A range of siliceous, ferruginous and calcareous indurated materials are also
present.
Four major drainage types have been identified based on lithological, sedimentological and
topographic differences in alluvial materials. The 4 drainage types include: 1) modern drainage; 2)
maghemite and quartzose gravels elevated 1-2 m relative to the modern drainage; 3) higher
topographically inverted, and at least partly silicified, gravels; and, 4) sediments of Cretaceous origin.
Multiple phases of drainage stability and instability from the Cretaceous to the present are indicated
within the sediments. Breaching of drainage divides and increased dissection of the modern drainage,
especially to the south of Cobar, indicate possible tectonic movement across a major regolith-landform
boundary in the southern map area. Colluvial materials are more widespread to the north of Cobar
reflecting the increased landscape dissection to the south. Colluvial fans are preserved adjacent to
major rangefronts. Aeolian and lacustrine materials include longitudinal dunefields of the Darling
River floodplain, source bordering dunes, and small lunettes associated with the Barnato Lakes system.
Regolith-landform mapping at Cobar has been used to assess the applicability of previously
developed landscape evolution models of the Cobar Block and surrounding region, and to develop a
new landscape evolution model for the region. The new landscape evolution model of Cobar indicates
minimal deposition of Cretaceous sediments, succeeded by high-energy early Tertiary fluvial regimes
across the Cobar landscape. Weathering and sediment deposition continued into the Miocene, coupled
with deep valley incision on the Cobar Block associated with early Oligocene regression. By the close
of the Miocene, the Cobar Block had eroded to predominantly bedrock terrain and widespread filling of
previously incised valleys occurred. A decrease in erosion and fluvial activity led to the formation of
the modern drainage during the Pliocene-early Quaternary, followed by the formation of alluvial,
aeolian and lacustrine deposits in the later Quaternary. Regionally, Eromanga Basin sediments were not
extensive over the Cobar Block, and low rates of erosion are recorded at Cobar from the Cretaceous to
the present. Former northerly drainage did exist in this area in the Cretaceous, but was limited in
distribution. By at least the Early Tertiary the Cobar area was a structural high and drainage systems of
the region had assumed their current configuration. These findings do not support interpretations of
AFTT data of significant cover and subsequent stripping over the Cobar Block in the Early Tertiary.
Evidence of landscape evolution from the Cretaceous to the present suggests that the Cobar
landscape has been responding to changes in the primary landscape forming factors of lithology,
climate and to a lesser degree, tectonics. Variations in the these three primary landscape forming
factors have contributed to ongoing weathering, relatively continuous deposition, and periods of
relative stability and instability, particularly in response to climatic and baselevel fluctuations, within a
dynamically evolving landscape throughout the entire Tertiary. Former landscape evolution models of
peneplanation and pediplanation, based on correlation of palaeosurfaces including duricrusts, a deep
weathering profile developed during extended planation in the Early Tertiary, and tectonism during the
late Tertiary in the Cobar area, are not supported by evidence preserved in regolith-landform features at
Cobar.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cobar</field><field name="subject">Central New South Wales</field><field name="subject">NSW</field><field name="subject">landforms</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Regolith</field><field name="subject">landscape evolution</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20050704.162445</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Assessing estimators of feral goat (Capra hircus) abundance</field><field name="creator">Tracey, John Paul</field><field name="description">(1) Reliable measures of population abundance are essential for managing wildlife
effectively. Aerial surveys provide a rapid and efficient means of surveying large mammals
and many techniques have been developed to adjust for the inability to count all animals
within transects. The probability of detection varies according to a range of factors which
are important to consider when estimating density. Standardised survey methods developed
in flat country are not readily transferable to steep terrain due to safety, access and
difficulties delineating transect widths. Other methods have logistic constraints and must
adhere to various other assumptions.
(2) Density estimators are seldom examined using actual population size, hence their
ability to correct for true bias is unknown. Studies that compare techniques are difficult to
interpret because of the uncertainty of adherence to their respective assumptions. Factors
influencing detection probability, estimators that correct for bias, the validity of their
assumptions and how these relate to true density are important considerations for selecting
suitable methods. The aim of this study was to obtain accurate and reliable methods for
estimating the density of feral goats by improving predictions of detection probability,
investigating the assumptions of aerial surveys, and examining the accuracy of 15 density
estimators by comparing with total counts of feral goats.
(3) Group size, vegetation and observer were the most important factors influencing the
probability of observing a group of goats during aerial surveys. However, different
approaches to analysing these data influenced the significance of variables and the
predicted probabilities. Goat colour, type of helicopter, site and rear observer experience in
hours were also found to be significant (P&lt;0.05) when using likelihood equations based on
all animals in the population rather than only those in the sample. The slope of the terrain
was also shown to significantly (P=0.014) affect the probability of detection.
(4) Indices are commonly used in wildlife management for their simplicity and
practicality, but their validity has been questioned because of variable probability of
detection. Results of this study suggest aerial survey indices are useful in monitoring a

range of medium-sized mammal species across space and time if differences in detection
probability between species, group size, vegetation and observer are considered and their
effects are standardised.
(5) An assumption of most sampling regimes that is fundamental but rarely examined is
that animals are not counted more than once. In this study the behavioural responses of
feral goats to helicopters were investigated as a basis for estimating the probability that
goats were recounted. No long-term consequences were evident in feral goat behaviour of
responses to helicopters. However, helicopter surveys were found to alter the structure of
42% of groups observed, with 28% of groups merging with others and 14% splitting into
separate groups. Therefore, group size estimated from the air should not be considered as
biologically important, and when estimating density, researchers should also avoid using
group sizes determined from independent ground observations to correct group sizes
determined from aerial surveys. Goats were also more likely to flush further when
helicopters were within 150 m, which is close to or within standard helicopter strip widths.
Substantial movement occurred between transects and 21% of goats were estimated to be
available for recounting in adjacent transects.
(6) Different detection probabilities between groups of goats may be particularly
relevant when using double-counting, where multiple observers are &#65533;capturing&#65533; and
&#65533;recapturing&#65533; animals in the same instant. Many analyses test and adjust for this &#65533;unequal
catchability&#65533; assumption in different ways, with the approaches of Huggins and Alho
allowing prediction of unique probability values for a range of co-variates. The approach of
Chao attempts to correct for skewed distributions in small samples. The Horvitz-Thompson
approach provides a useful basis for estimating abundance (or density) when detection
probability can be estimated and is known to vary between observations according to a
range of independent variables, and also avoids errors associated with averaging group size.
(7) After correcting for recounting, the Alho estimator applied to helicopter surveys
was the most accurate (Bias = 0.02) and reliable of all techniques, which suggests that
estimates were improved by taking into account unconditional detection probability and
correcting individual observations according to their characteristics. The positive bias

evident in the Chao (Bias = 0.28) and Petersen (Bias = 0.15) aerial survey estimators may
have been a result of averaging detection probability across all observations. The
inconsistency and inaccuracy of the ground-based area-count technique emphasises the
importance of other assumptions in density estimation, such as representative sampling and
availability bias. The accuracy of index-manipulation-index techniques was dependent on
the indices used. Capture-recapture estimates using mustering showed slight negative bias
(Bias = -0.08), which was likely a result of increased probability of re-capture (i.e. trap
happy). Ground-based capture-resight estimates were labour intensive and positively biased
(Bias = 0.13), likely due to underestimating the area sampled, or overestimating the number
of unmarked individuals with each sample.
(8) Helicopter survey using double-counting is recommended for estimating the density
of feral goats in steep terrain. However, consideration of recounting under intensive
sampling regimes and adjustments for the factors that influence unconditional detection
probability is required.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">feral goats</field><field name="subject">Capra hircus</field><field name="subject">managing wildlife</field><field name="subject">aerial surveying</field><field name="subject">Alho</field><field name="subject">Chao</field><field name="subject">Peterson</field><field name="subject">estimators</field><field name="subject">density</field><field name="subject">helicopter surveying</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20050708.103427</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The landscape-scale structure and functioning of floodplains</field><field name="creator">Sims, Neil C</field><field name="description">Floodplains are amongst the most productive and biodiverse ecosystems. The structure and functioning of floodplains is controlled by the interaction of intermittent inundation with the floodplain landscape. These interactions create highly complex and dynamic ecosystems that are difficult to study at large scales. Consequently, most research of floodplains has been conducted at small spatial and temporal scales. Inundation of floodplains can extend over many square kilometres, however, which unifies the floodplain landscape into an integrated ecosystem operating at the landscape scale. The lack of data and poor understanding of the landscape-scale structure and functioning of floodplains limits the possibility of managing floodplains sustainably as pressure for exploitation of their resources increases. This thesis quantifies the landscape-scale relationship between the frequency and patterns of inundation, the composition and structure of the landscape, and the functioning of the floodplain landscape in terms of the distribution and dynamics of plant growth vigour over an area of approximately 376,000 ha on the Lower Balonne Floodplain; highly biodiverse, semi-arid floodplain ecosystem that straddles the state border between New South Wales and Queensland approximately 500 km inland from the eastern coast of Australia. Mean annual rainfall at St.George, to the north of the study area, is approximately 400&#65533;450 mm per year, and median annual evaporation is approximately 2000 mm per year. Plants and animals on the floodplain are therefore heavily dependent upon flooding for survival. This project is based on the analysis of 13 Landsat Thematic Mapper satellite images captured over a 10-year period during which land and water resource development increased substantially. There is now concern that development activities have affected the functioning of the floodplain to the detriment of the natural environment and
agricultural productivity. The impacts from these activities on the functioning of the floodplain are not yet known, however. Inundation of the Lower Balonne Floodplain was mapped using a two-part process involving a band ratio to identify deep clear water, and a change detection analysis to identify areas of shallower inundation. This analysis shows that, in contrast with most floodplains, the main flowpath of the Lower Balonne Floodplain runs along its central axis away from river channels, which flow along the floodplain&#65533;s outer edges. Inundation propagates from the centre of the floodplain out towards river channels as flood discharge volumes increase. Variations in the spatial pattern of inundated patches within the inundated extent create distinctive aquatic habitat and connectivity conditions at different flow levels. These can be described in terms of three connectivity phases: (I) Disconnected, in which isolated patches of inundation occur at low flows and river channels are hydrologically dislocated from the floodplain; (II) Interaction, where increased hydrological connectivity between inundated patches, and between the floodplain and the river channels at moderate flows, may enable significant exchange of materials, organisms and energy; and (III) Integration, in which almost the entire floodplain landscape is connected by open water during large magnitude floods. There is an abrupt transition in inundation patterns as flows increase between 60,000 ML day-1 and 65,000 ML day-1 (ARI 2 to 2.3 years) in which inundation patterns transform from being relatively disconnected into a highly integrated network of patches. These patterns may have significant consequences for the structure and functioning of the floodplain. Increases in flows across this small range may therefore mark an important ecological flow threshold on this system. Water resource development impacts have changed the relative frequency of flows on the Lower

Balonne Floodplain, which will probably affect the sequence of connectivity phases over time. The most likely impact of these changes will be to create a floodplain that is drier overall than under natural flow conditions, and that has a smaller and wetter area of high inundation frequency. The relationship between inundation and the structure of the floodplain landscape was examined by comparing a landcover map showing the distribution and character of 10 landcover types to the inundation frequency maps. Landcover types were mapped from a multi-date Reference Image composite of seven images captured over a period of 10 years. The Reference Image improves landcover discrimination by at least 14% over classification of a single-date image, and has an overall accuracy between 82.5% and 85% at the landscape-scale. The Reference Image shows that the landscape of the Lower Balonne Floodplain is a highly fragmented mosaic of diverse landcover types distributed in association with inundation frequency. Stratifying the floodplain into zones of frequent and rare inundation shows that frequently inundated areas have a less fragmented but less diverse landscape structure than rarely inundated areas. Assessment of the functioning of each landcover types within the floodplain ecosystem, based on landscape pattern metric analysis, indicates that the function of landcover types also changes between inundation frequency zones. Most importantly, these changes include a transformation of the matrix landcover type, which controls the character and dynamics of the ecosystem overall, from Open Grassland to Coolibah Open Woodland in the frequently inundated zone. The landscape structure of the Lower Balonne Floodplain has been affected by development impacts, which include clearing of native vegetation, isolation of parts of the floodplain from natural inundation events by the construction of levee banks and drainage channels, and grazing impacts. Changes to the inundation regime may also

affect the structure of the floodplain landscape. Over the long term, these changes are likely to create a larger area of Open Grassland and a smaller area of Coolibah Open Woodland as the zone of frequent inundation becomes smaller and wetter. To examine the functioning of the floodplain ecosystem, the inundation maps were compared to remotely sensed indexes of plant growth vigour at the landscape and landcover-type scales. The dynamics of plant growth vigour over time are influenced by factors operating at the regional, landscape and patch scales. Evaporation is the major control of growth vigour levels at the landscape scale, but each landcover type has a distinctive pattern of growth vigour dynamics that is related to its composition and location, and possibly its landscape structure. The association between the spatial distribution of plant growth vigour and inundation frequency is non-linear, with the highest growth vigour occurring where inundation occurs approximately once per year. This indicates a subsidy-stress interaction with water in which plant growth vigour is limited by soil anoxia in areas of frequent or long term inundation, and by drought stress in rarely inundated areas. A landscape-scale model of growth vigour dynamics, founded on the principles of Hierarchical Patch Dynamics and Landscape Ecology, was created from growth vigour measurements of each landcover type over time. This model was used to examine possible impacts of development activities on the functioning of the floodplain ecosystem. This model shows that the response of plant growth vigour development activities can be complex and subtle, and include a change in mean long-term growth vigour and an increased susceptibility to drought. The model also indicates that periods of high growth vigour can occur in substantially altered floodplain ecosystems. The model was also used to explore the levels of landcover change that might cause a threshold change in the functioning of the ecosystem, which may substantially alter the

disturbance-response characteristics of the floodplain ecosystem. The model indicates a threshold change when the extent of Open Grassland is reduced by 30% of its extent in 1993, in which plant growth vigour response to disturbance is virtually inverted from that observed in the images. The temporal variability of plant growth vigour levels increases as the extent of Open Grassland is further reduced. This thesis makes a number of important contributions to our understanding of floodplain structure and functioning. It includes the development of new techniques suited to studying large diverse and complex landscapes at the landscape scale from satellite images, and provides quantitative data describing the links between the structure of floodplain landscapes and their functioning at the landscape scale. This work improves the understanding of floodplain ecosystems by integrating models of floodplain structure and functioning, which have been developed largely from smaller-scale studies of temperate and tropical floodplains, with landscape-scale measurements of this semi-arid system. This thesis also has implications for the Lower Balonne Floodplain by improving the level of information about this important ecosystem and providing baseline data against which the condition of the floodplain can be assessed in future.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">floodplains</field><field name="subject">biodiverse ecosystems</field><field name="subject">landscape scale structure</field><field name="subject">Lower Balonne Floodplain</field><field name="subject">New South Wales</field><field name="subject">Queensland</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20050706.095439</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Women's experience of the effects of breast cancer treatment on sex and the couple relationship</field><field name="creator">Gray, Jeannie</field><field name="description">Sex after breast cancer treatment has hitherto been studied chiefly by quantitative
methods, which have found that at least a third of women concerned have sexual
difficulties. The reasons for this were not clearly identified, but were usually held to be
associated with depressed mood and negative body image. This study gathered
information about sex and the couple relationship by means of in-depth interviews with
fdteen women, and reports their experiences as they recounted them. All had been
treated with breast surgery, four with radiotherapy, nine with chemotherapy and eight
with the hormone treatment, tamoxifen. Fourteen had had sex since their treatment, and
twelve of these had sexual difficulties they had not been having before the treatment,
These difficulties were not connected with either mood changes or body image concerns,
but were mainly due to problems with desire and orgasm and to vulva1 and vaginal
symptoms. Most women attributed these problems to menopause, whether natural,
induced by the chemotherapy or exacerbated by tamoxifen. The couple relationship in
this circumstance has not been intensively studied until now. The study found that a
positive shift commonly took place in the less stable relationships, so that the couple
became closer, and sex, including heterosexual intercourse, became more acceptable to
the woman. There was no change in the stable relationships. In both stable and less
stable relationships, though intercourse was wished for by the heterosexual women, the
sexual difficulties described above inhibited its successful accomplishment. The study
also reports the coping methods used by the women and their experience of trying to find
information about the subject of sex and sexual difficulties, from health professionals and
other sources.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">breast cancer</field><field name="subject">treatment</field><field name="subject">sex</field><field name="subject">relationships</field><field name="subject">couple relationship</field><field name="subject">effects</field><field name="subject">sexual difficulties</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20050711.113420</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The establishment of the Christmas Island Area School: a public policy analysis</field><field name="creator">Foster, Ian D</field><field name="description">In 1974 the Australian Government decided that from 1975 all education on its Territory of Christmas Island, Indian Ocean, would be integrated into a single service. It further decided that all schools would be
staffed by Australian teachers from its recent1y established
Commonwealth Teaching Service and would implement a curriculum closely reflecting those on the Australian mainland. These were decisive shifts
from the previous system of separating the 'Asian' education system from the 'European' (Australian) system. This thesis sets out to find the
reasons for these decisions and the expectations, or objectives, of those who made them.
The changes to education had many Impacts on the Christmas Island community - both intended or unintended. These impacts are used to assist in evaluations of the policy objectives. The thesis uses the methodology of public policy analysis to examine the links between the government's education policy and its other broader policies regarding the Island. It thus examines operational decisions in the context of strategic considerations.
The mid 1970s saw rapid changes in many Australian Government policies.
Its new Christmas Island policies were responses to a range of complex,
interrelated problems which emerged in the early 1970s - only 15 years
after it assumed sovereignty. At the centre of these policy responses
was Resettlement. The government's education decisions are examined in
the light of the objectives and implications of its Resettlement policy
as well as other inputs to the policy problem.</field><field name="date">1990</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Christmas Island Area School</field><field name="subject">education</field><field name="subject">Territory of Christmas Island</field><field name="subject">Australian Government</field><field name="subject">Federal Government</field><field name="subject">Commonwealth Teaching Service</field><field name="subject">curriculum</field><field name="subject">Christmas Island</field><field name="subject">public policy analysis</field><field name="subject">education policy</field><field name="subject">education systems</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20050711.124419</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Portrayal of aged characters in Australian award-winning children's novels 1946-1985</field><field name="creator">Kirk, Joyce</field><field name="description">The study investigated the nature of the
portrayal of aged characters in children's novels which
won Children's Book Council of Australia's awards in
the period from 1946 to 1985. By means of content
analysis, the demographic, personal and behavioural
characteristics of aged characters were identified on a
thirty-four item checklist. From these characteristics
a portrayal score was derived to represent the extent
of variation in the depiction of aged characters in the
novels examined.
Analysis of variance tests indicated that the
level of variation in portrayal scores was
significantly related to the position of importance of
aged characters in novels. The portrayal of aged
characters did not vary according either to the
approach to story adopted in Australian award-winning
novels, or to the period in which the award was
granted.
It seems that although aged characters taken as
a whole in the novels studied display the variety of
characteristics attributed to aged people in the
literature of gerontology, individually many of these
aged characters are depicted in a somewhat limited way.
There is evidence to suggest that aged characters in
Australian award-winning children's novels do not
adequately reflect the demographic characteristics of
aged people in the Australian population. In terms of

range of social settings in which they are depicted is
restricted. So too, is the range of behaviours in which
they engage.
This rather limited depiction of aged
characters means that readers of Australian award-winning
children's novels are presented with a
restricted and unrealistic view of the aged and of the
condition of being aged. If children's novels serve as
one of the socialisation agents for young people, then
the limited portrayal of aged characters presented in
those novels may be a cause for concern, especially as
there are few indications that the depiction of aged
characters generally in more recent award-winning
novels has become more varied and realistic.</field><field name="date">1988</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">aged characters</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">award-winning children's novels</field><field name="subject">1946-1985</field><field name="subject">portrayal</field><field name="subject">Children's Book Council of Australia</field><field name="subject">children's novels</field><field name="subject">children's books</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20050711.143505</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reentry and retention: a study of the relationship between characteristics of reentry nurses and reemployment in nursing</field><field name="creator">Foley, Elizabeth</field><field name="description">The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship
between characteristics of refreshed registered nurses and
reemployment in the nursing workforce post Refresher
programme. The application forms completed by the
participants of the six programmes conducted by the ACT
Health Authority (ACTHA, now Department of Community Services
and Health ACT) provided data for a profile analysis.
Employment data was derived mostly from statistics compiled
by the Research Officer, Nursing, ACTHA.
The findings of this study demonstrated that inactive
registered nurses do return to nursing from periods of
non-participation as nurses, following completion of
Refresher programmes. Moreover, significant numbers of these
returning nurses remain in nursing employment. In relation
to that aspect of workforce planning which considers sources
of supply for the registered nurse labour market an area for
further study would be to explore the area of patient care in
which the greater concentration of refreshed nurses were to
be found post programme: acute care settings or extended care
facilities.
The study found that predictions of the successful reentry to
nursing of the individual refreshed nurse and of retention in
the nursing workforce could not be based on the
characteristics of that person, alone. These findings
supported the study's hypothesis that there would be no
statistically significant difference between the
characteristics of refreshed registered nurses who returned
to, and remain in, the nursing workforce and those refreshers
who either did not reenter nursing post programme or who left
during the following twelve months. The characteristics
examined were age, family status, post registration nursing
experience, post registration nursing courses, worked as a
nurse in the ACT prior to the programme, previous employment
status, and time inactive from nursing pre-Refresher
programme.
Trends were identified which indicated that with some
characteristics there was a greater likelihood of post
programme reemployability in nursing. Refreshed nurses who
reentered and remained in the nursing workforce tended to be
younger.than those not working as nurses. There was a trend
for post programme participators in the nursing workforce to
have had fewer years of post registration nursing experience
and to be more likely not to have obtained post registration

nursing qualifications than their counterparts not working in
nursing positions.
Perhaps not surprisingly the study found that a higher
proportion of the refreshers employed as nurses had
previously worked at some stage in ACT health care facilities

as registered nurses. A somewhat unexpected finding was that
amongst the group of refreshed nurses working in nursing the
largest contingent had been inactive from nursing for more
years than was the case for those not working as nurses.
The majority of refreshed registered nurses, whether they
were working as nurses post programme or not had a family
status of partner/husband and child(ren) and were unemployed

before undertaking the Refresher programme.
Refreshed registered nurses have provided a source of supply
to the nursing workforce during a period of shortage of
qualified nurses in the health care system. In the latter
part of the 1980's there have been indications that shortage
is largely confined to nurses with specialised skills. The
findings from this study should assist the nursing profession
in deciding the future role of programmes of reentry for
inactive registered nurses who require reskilling for current
clinical competence for general patient care areas.</field><field name="date">1990</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">re-entry nurses</field><field name="subject">re-employability</field><field name="subject">nursing</field><field name="subject">nurses</field><field name="subject">relationship</field><field name="subject">registered nurses</field><field name="subject">nursing employment</field><field name="subject">refreshed nurses</field><field name="subject">retraining</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20050711.151302</field></doc><doc><field name="title">How children view schooling: a study of the views of schooling held by year 6 pupils in selected government schools in New South Wales</field><field name="creator">Foggett, Albert Colin Sydney</field><field name="description">The purpose of this study was twofold.

it aimed to present an argument for the inclusion of

explore the potential of primary-age children to

children have worthwhile views of schooling that
should be introduced into both classroom and school

development, childrenqs rights and active learning
were explored in relation to child participation in

This study attempted to explore children's views
of schooling from the viewpoints of the children

was constructed to allow the exploration of their
views.
The study shows that primary-age children have

group theoretical investigations since the advent of modern computing
power, but in some respects the process is still not well understood.
This thesis investigates some features of coset enumeration, working
mainly with the group F(2,7). 
Chapter 1 describes the characteristics of coset enumeration and
algorithms used for it. A worked example of the method is provided.
Chapter 2 discusses some features which would be desirable in computer
programs for use in investigating the coset enumeration process itself,
and reviews the Havas/Alford program which to date best meets the
requirements.
Chapter 3 deals with the use of coset ammeration in proofs, either in
its own right or as a basis for other workings. An example of one
attempt to obtain a proof by coset enumeration is given.
Chapter 4 reviews techniques designed to reduce the length of coset
enumerations and proposes the 'equality list' technique as a way to
reduce enumeration length for some groups. Extra insights obtainable
using the equality list method are also discussed.
Chapter 5 summarises the factors by which the success of different
coset enumerations can be compared and proposes an algorithm for making
systematic comparisons among enumerations.
Chapter 6 reports five coset enumerations, obtained manually by three
main methods on the group F(2,7). All these enumerations were shorter
than is so far obtainable by machine and one is shorter than other
known hand enumerations. The enumerations were compared by applying
the process developed in Chapter 5.
Chapter 7 presents a shorter proof of the cyclicity of the group F(2,7)
than was hitherto available. The proof derives from the workings for
one of the coset enumerations described in Chapter 6.
There are eight appendices and an annotated bibliography. The
appendices contain, inter alia, edited correspondence between
well-known coset-enumerators, a guide to the Havas/Alford program,

learning process and that they tend to use a number of metacognitive processes to
monitor learning and remembering. Drawing on the theoretical framework of Nelson
and Narens (1992), the current study examined the effect of certain variables on
metamemory processes and on students' ability to recall and recognise learned
material. 
The present study explored the effect of four independent variables on five dependent variables.
The independent variables were:
1. degree of learning (responses given until 2 or 8 times correct),
2. judgment of learning (JOL) timing (given immediately after learning session or 24
hours later),
3. retention interval between study and test (2 or 6 weeks), and
4. type of material studied (sentences, in or out of context).
The dependent variables were:
1. judgement of learning (JOL),
2. confidence rating,
3. feeling of knowing (FOK),
4. recall, and
5. recognition..
As ancillary analyses, the study explored, firstly, whether gender differences had an
effect on meta-level and object-level memory, and secondly, whether students who
recalled more also made more accurate metamemory judgements.
The effects of the independent variables on recall and recognition were consistent
with those found by previous studies. The most interesting new finding of the present study was that students who made JOLs after twenty four hours were more likely to
take into account the effect of the interval between learning and testing. Students who
made immediate JOLs did not allow for the effect of the time interval on retention. A
further new finding was that gender appeared to have had an influence on JOLs.
The findings about the effects of timing of JOLs and of gender effects on JOL have
implications for metacognitive theory and will stimulate further research.
The practical significance of this research, particularly the implications for study skills
training for all students, was that educators cannot presume that students will correctly
predict what they will recall after six weeks if they make that judgement immediately
after learning has occurred. Therefore, the effects of the passage of time on memory,
and the efficacy of delaying judgments, should be made explicit.
The finding that the manipulation of JOL timing has a significant effect on the
accuracy of judgements has implications in the wider area of educational policymaking
and for the current debate on competencies and quality assurance. Learning

the Australian Defence Group of departments over the
past 34 years led to a notion that for organisations
operating in turbulent environments there may exist a
hypothetical re1ationship between perceived
environmental uncertainty and organised complexity.
This hypothetica1 relationship is described as 'coping'
and is based on an assumption that in an organisational
setting, individuals make some form of response to
changes in their environment and this response is
manifest in organisational change.
The notion of this hypothetical relationship
also led to the development of two 'ideal type' models -
the Coping Model and the Overload Model. The
application of contingency theory through the Overload
Model showed that the State of an Organisation could be
defined acccrdicg to its mode of existence in relation
to some optimal level of information processing and some
optimal level of organised complexity. A typology of
ths States of Organisations has been derived from the
Overload Model and design strategies which are appropriate
to each state have been ranked according to an ordinal
preference scale. The 'ideal type' models have allowed
subjectively weighted judgements to be made about the
present state of the Defence organisation and the ranking
of design strategies to avoid the perceived undesirable
state of overload.
The Department of Defence is now imputed to
be in a state of 'disorganisation'. The Overload
Model suggests that there has been an over-investment
in vertical information systems at the expense of
lateral relations. The policy-making implication of
this suggestion is that the state of 'overload' can be
avoided through a reduction in organised complexity and
the creation of lateral relations. This can be
achieved if the Central Office is restructured to reduce
the number of committees and if appropriate co-ordinating
representatives are placed in the Service Offices.</field><field name="date">1979</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">organisations</field><field name="subject">Australian Defence Group</field><field name="subject">reorganisation</field><field name="subject">turbulent environments</field><field name="subject">change</field><field name="subject">overload model</field><field name="subject">coping model</field><field name="subject">disorganisation</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20050712.110131</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Youth unemployment and schooling in relation to human resources development in Papua New Guinea</field><field name="creator">Kereme, Philip Tene</field><field name="description">n/a</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">youth</field><field name="subject">employment</field><field name="subject">unemployment</field><field name="subject">schooling</field><field name="subject">education</field><field name="subject">Papua New Guinea</field><field name="subject">human resources development</field><field name="subject">education reform</field><field name="subject">human capital theory</field><field name="subject">Schulz</field><field name="subject">wage competition</field><field name="subject">job competition</field><field name="subject">school leavers</field><field name="subject">villages</field><field name="subject">school curriculum</field><field name="subject">community life</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20050712.120913</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Investigation of a Professional Development Scheme for teachers: work experience in industry and research</field><field name="creator">Dyer, Barbara J</field><field name="description">n/a---Introduction--- This thesis deals with an investigation od a Professional Development Scheme which gave three Teaching Service teachers working experience in one of Australia's largest research organisations, a Canberra hotel, and an ACT office furniture business (one of the largest manufacturers of its kind within Australia) during the September school vacation of 1988.-----Aim----The aim of the thesis is to analyse and evaluate the effectiveness of the Professional Development Scheme in the context of the relationship between the school and the world of work.</field><field name="date">1990</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">work experience</field><field name="subject">Professional Development Scheme</field><field name="subject">teaching</field><field name="subject">education</field><field name="subject">industry</field><field name="subject">research</field><field name="subject">professional development</field><field name="subject">Nicholls' evaluation model</field><field name="subject">Instant Office Furniture</field><field name="subject">Canberra Hyatt Hotel</field><field name="subject">CSIRO</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20050714.123358</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Relationships between feral goats (Capra hircus) and domestic sheep (Ovis aries) with reference to exotic disease transmission</field><field name="creator">Fleming, Peter J S</field><field name="description">Merino sheep are the most numerous domestic livestock in Australia and feral
goats are wide-spread and locally abundant in many of the regions where sheep
are grazed. Foot and mouth disease (FMD) is a disease of ungulates that causes
severe economic hardship to countries where outbreaks occur or where it has
become endemic. In India, Africa, Greece and recently the United Kingdom and
Eire, sheep and goats have been implicated in the spread and maintenance of
FMD. In Australia, there are contingency plans (AUSVETPLANS) for dealing with
an outbreak of FMD. Included in those plans are strategies for control of the
disease in feral ungulates including feral pigs and feral goats. Modelling has
provided assistance in developing strategies to combat outbreaks in feral pigs and
for controlling outbreaks in domestic livestock. No models have been constructed
to aid decisions about controlling FMD in feral goats where they co-occur with
merino sheep.
In Australia, the greatest densities of free-ranging feral goats and domestic
livestock occur in the high rainfall zone (&gt; 500 mm mean annual rainfall) along the
eastern tablelands and adjacent slopes of the Great Dividing Range. Previous
studies of feral goat biology, population dynamics and behaviour in Australia have
concentrated on arid and semi-arid zones or on islands. Interactions between free
ranging feral goats and merino sheep have not previously been studied in the high
rainfall zone.
My study investigated the ecological and behavioural characteristics of feral goats
and their interactions with sympatric merino sheep at a high rainfall site in central
eastern New South Wales. The population dynamics, biological and behavioural
parameters of feral goats and sheep were then used to model FMD in such an
environment. Deterministic temporal models and a new spatial stochastic model

were used. Of particular interest were the rates of contact within and between
subgroups of feral goats (termed herds and mobs), within and between subgroups
of merino sheep (termed flocks and mobs), and between subgroups of the two
species.
Feral goats at the study site were found to be numerous (mean density = 34.94
goats km-2, from aerial surveys), in good condition, fecund and had high adult
survival and low annual adult mortality (survival= 0.81&#65533;1.00) in the absence of
harvesting and hunting. They had an observed instantaneous rate of increase of
0.112 per year. Annual rate of increase was similar to other sites in Australia
without sustained harvesting pressure. Home ranges were small for both males
(3.754 km&#178;, s.e. = 0.232, n = 116 goats) and females (2.369 km&#178;, s.e. = 0.088, n =
241 goats). From this and other Australasian studies, an inverse power function
was found to be an excellent descriptor of the relationship between mean annual
rainfall and female home range size.
A resource selection function was fitted in a geographic information system to
observational data of feral goats. The habitat selection of feral goats included a
preference for wooded vegetation on eastern and north eastern aspects at higher
elevations. The resource selection function was also used to set the probabilities of
occurrence of feral goats in 1 ha areas of the landscape and these probabilities
were used to generate heterogeneity in a spatial model of foot and mouth disease
virus (FMDV) transmission.
Daily per capita contact rates were estimated from observed contacts in the field
where a contact between individuals was recognised when one approached within
1 body length ([approx] 1m) of another. The contacts between feral goats within herds
were frequent and occurred at a rate of 6.96 (s.e. = 1.27) goat&#65533;goat contacts day-1.
Sheep to sheep contacts were slightly less frequent (4.22 sheep&#65533;sheep contacts
day-1, s.e. = 0.65) but both estimates were most likely negatively biased because of
observer errors in estimating the number of individual animals coming in contact
with observation subject (focal) animals. Contacts between herds of feral goats
were not common and those between adjacent populations were fewer than 1 per
year. In sheep, flock to flock contact was largely governed by husbandry practices
and occurred at a mean daily rate of 0.0014 flock&#65533;flock contacts. Contacts
between sheep and feral goats were less frequent but nonetheless common (2.82
goat&#65533;sheep contacts day-1, s.e. = 0.40). In feral goats the size of the mob in which
focal goats were observed was found to be the most important factor in
determining contact rates between individuals and a counter-intuitive inverse
relationship was identified. Contacts were heterogeneous and density was not an
important determinant of contact rates implying that, because of the uniformly high
densities at the site, saturation had occurred.
The temporal models of FMDV transmission showed that the rate of contact within
and between species was such that FMD was predicted to spread rapidly
throughout an infected herd or flock. Control strategies of intense culling of feral
goats at the population level were predicted to allow the disease to persist at low
prevalence, with a small peak corresponding to the annual lambing pulse in sheep.
However, the same level of control (&gt;90% reduction) at the herd level was
predicted to eliminate FMD and allow the safe reintroduction of sheep. Extreme
control that left very small groups (&lt;3 individuals) may be counter productive
because such small groups are likely to join the reintroduced sheep in an effort by
the goats to meet gregarious urges.
The spatial model was more reassuring. It predicted that FMD would die out in a
mixed sheep and feral goat population in less than 90 days because of the low rate
of herd to herd contact and herd to flock contact. For similar environments, the

contingency planning consequences are that an outbreak of FMD introduced into
feral goats from sympatric sheep is likely to be containable by removing all the
sheep, determining the extent and likely range of the feral goats, then removing a
substantial proportion of or eradicating each herd. Feral goats, being relatively
sedentary, are unlikely to spread to adjacent populations and the disease will die
out through lack of contact between herds and populations. Because feral goat
home ranges overlap and are centred on one or two small catchments, a
containment ring of feral goat control, set to encompass the home range of a target
herd and that of adjacent herds, should be adequate to limit spread of FMD.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">feral goats</field><field name="subject">Capra hircus</field><field name="subject">domestic sheep</field><field name="subject">Ovis aries</field><field name="subject">exotic diseases</field><field name="subject">foot and mouth disease</field><field name="subject">FMD</field><field name="subject">AUSVETPLANS</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20050714.142151</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Foreign language learning and secondary schools in the Australian Capital Territory</field><field name="creator">Cullen, Helen Victoria</field><field name="description">This study examines trends over the past decade in

strategies in the Sri Lankan manufacturing sector. Applying the psychological contract
perspective, the researcher attempts to explore how employee involvement strategies are
sustained at the factory floor level. More specifically, the attempt is to understand the
involved behaviour of employee in the perspectives of a relational as well as a transactional
psychological contract. The empirical evidence is drawn from three case studies in to
consumer products, tobacco products and garment manufacturing in Sri Lanka.
The thesis highlights several key findings relating to the process of sustaining employee
involvement strategies in Sri Lankan manufacturing firms. First, the existence of a
psychological contract in the form of a relational contract supports the sustenance of
employee involvement strategies. Second, the social exchange process that produces the
relational contract in an employer-employee setting draws from situational factors such as the
supportive climate created by employer and employee development programmes and the
psychological factors, such as work values, job involvement, and commitment of the
employee to organization. Third important factor: the trust placed in the organization by the
employee develops exchange relationships with the organization, managers and fellow
employees leading to a relational psychological contract, which results in the sustenance of
outcomes of employee involvement. Some confirming evidence for the third factor could be
drawn from situations where a break down of trust prompts a violation of the psychological
contract. In such situations, the relational contract is transformed into a transactional contract
resulting in the failure of employee involvement process. Finally, the thesis finds little
evidence to support the view that moving down power, information, knowledge and skills and
rewards to the frontline employees alone are sufficient to sustain an employee involvement
process.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">employees</field><field name="subject">employee involvement</field><field name="subject">developing countries</field><field name="subject">Sri Lanka</field><field name="subject">manufacturing</field><field name="subject">psychological contracts</field><field name="subject">consumers</field><field name="subject">tobacco</field><field name="subject">garments</field><field name="subject">clothing</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20050719.125732</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Role of curriculum resources in three countries: the impact of national curriculum reforms in the United Kingdom, the United States of America, and Australia</field><field name="creator">Watt, Michael G</field><field name="description">This project examines the impact of standards-based and curriculum

This dissertation presents the findings of an experimental study that aims to extend the
discourse of educational research through a 'performative ethnographic analysis' by
using a single-site case study approach. The case study is an analytical parody based on
multiple discourse relevant to a 'new' and different approach to educational research so
that a more comprehensive and complex process of reading and writing text becomes
possible. Throughout this process, a generative methodology and interpretative base are
anticipated to provide a metaphoric focus for a critical dialogue.
The discourse informing the theoretical and interpretative base of the study include
philosophy, science, visual arts, literary theory, critical postructuralist theory and theatre performance. The data are presented as a series of performance narratives in the form of
socio-drama, interspersed with critical reflection that enables the researcher, the
research participant and reader to become part of a triadic construct.
The findings from this study have major implications for informing contemporary
educational research, as they demonstrate that by approaching research in 'new' and
different ways, the researcher and the educational community have access to insights
that are unavailable within the constraints of conventional models of research.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">educational research</field><field name="subject">research models</field><field name="subject">theatre arts</field><field name="subject">ethnography</field><field name="subject">Bertolt Brecht</field><field name="subject">research process</field><field name="subject">theatre of absurdity</field><field name="subject">case studies</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20050726.094032</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Public participation in planning: a case study of Canberra A.C.T.</field><field name="creator">Uddin, Mohammed Kamal</field><field name="description">Traditional models of public participation in planning have been criticized as 'top-down'
segregating planners from ordinary citizens; thus, there has been a quest for greater public
involvement in planning decisions and policy-making. The public demands a greater
voice in planning and development affairs. To provide public input into the planning
process, planning agencies often establish Citizen Advisory Committees (CAC) to
involve the public in planning decisions. The increasing redevelopment pressure in inner
city suburbs in most Australian cities has led to the creation of many advisory groups for
advising planning agencies and Ministers for Planning on planning and development
matters. These advisory committees usually consist of people of diverse backgrounds
elected, selected and/or appointed by the planning agency to provide community input
into planning policy making.
However, little is known about the context and operational process in the consultation
processes of advisory committees. Much of the existing literature on public participation
lacks widely applicable evaluation approaches for determining whether the existing
context and process is fair and effective in the participation process. As complex social
phenomena, public participation processes are influenced by contextual factors. This
thesis examines the Terms of Reference and the operational process of planning advisory
committees, and evaluates them through two proposed meta-criteria: fairness and
effectiveness. LAPACs in Canberra have been selected for the evaluation of the
participation process, providing a basis to develop a conceptual model for its
improvement. The analysis is based on a theoretical framework, which focuses on the
criteria of fairness and effectiveness in the public participation process.
This study uses a qualitative approach to data analysis using multi-method techniques
such as focus interviews, document analysis and participant observation. The interviews
were conducted with LAPAC members and other planning community who were directly
or indirectly involved in the ACT's consultation process, and aware of its planning
decisions. They are development proponents, the enthusiastic wider public, planning staff,
the Minister for Planning, and planning spokespersons of political parties.
The data provide insight into the details of the proposed criteria to evaluate the fairness
and effectiveness of a participation process. The results suggest that improving the
participation process in a planning advisory committee requires changes in committee
protocols, operational processes and planner roles in conducting the participation
processes. Specifically, there needs to be a move away from static processes toward more
strategic, active and accountable processes. This thesis suggests some practical steps, in
order to ensure greater fairness and effectiveness in the participation process of a
planning advisory committee, and recommends the proposed evaluative criteria as a new
framework for evaluating planning advisory committees.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">planning advisory committees</field><field name="subject">public participation</field><field name="subject">urban planning</field><field name="subject">Canberra</field><field name="subject">LAPAC</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20050726.095212</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Comparing expectations and experience of public and private sector management in Australia: a study of Australian Public Service Interchange Program participants</field><field name="creator">Stanton, Meryl</field><field name="description">This thesis establishes an empirically based dialogue between two theoretical approaches to management, one emphasing structure and the other process, by examining the question of whether management in private sector, profit oriented organizations is similar to, or different from, management in government departments.

The measuring instruments used were a questionnaire designed to test empirically and to extend research by Fottler (1981), a standardised measure of personal values and two questionnaires to gather personal details and job related information pertinent to the parent and host organizations.
The results of the study indicate that Interchange participants found significant differences between the Service and the private-for-profit organizations in which they worked.  The differences within the major structural variable, organization type, can be expressed in terms of managerial processes.  Evidence was found of interrelationships between organization type, job related process variables and personal values.

optimise crop water use through timely irrigation scheduling decisions. Airborne
video imagery when calibrated with a low density of ground based observations, offers
the potential for near real time monitoring of crop condition, through sequential
coverages of entire cotton fields. Using commercially available video equipment
mounted on a light aircraft images were acquired of field experiments that were
established in commercial cotton fields to test if the imagery could monitor changes in
crop condition. Ground data collected from these experiments were used to evaluate
green, red, near infrared and thermal band imagery for irrigated crop management.
Prior to acquiring imagery, a ground radiometer study was conducted to
investigate if canopy reflectance changed with the onset of crop water stress. Canopy
reflectance decreased in the near infrared and green bands during the five day period
prior to the crop's normal irrigation date. Red reflectance increased only after the crop
irrigation was due, when the crop was suffering from water stress. The greatest
change in canopy reflectance was in the near infrared region, attributable in part to a
decrease in ground cover caused by canopy architectural changes including leaf
wilting. The results of this experiment were used to select spectral filters for the video cameras.
A range of crop conditions were identified in the imagery including; crop
waterlogging, wheeltrack soil compaction, crop nitrogen status, different varieties,
crop maturity, canopy development, soil moisture status, cotton yield and nutgrass
weeds. Thermal imagery was the most successful for distinguishing differences in the
crop soil moisture status. Near infrared imagery was most closely related to crop
canopy development and is recommended for monitoring crop growth.
Linear relationships were found between spectral responses in the imagery,
crop reflectance (%) and crop temperature measured on the ground. Near infrared
reflectance linearly increased, while spectral responses in the green, red and thermal
bands exhibited an inverse relationship with plant height and ground cover. Imagery
collected early in the season was affected by the soil background. Final lint yield was
related to imagery in the red band. As the soil moisture level declined, crop
temperature increased while reflectance in the green band decreased. To ensure an
accurate relationship between soil moisture and thermal imagery, separate calibration
equations are recommended for different stages in the season.
Green, red and near infrared imagery were affected by the sun angle that
caused one side of the imagery to appear brighter than the other. This problem was
greatest in the green and red bands, but was not evident in the thermal imagery.
Changes in solar radiation and air temperature on some occasions caused greater
variation to the imagery between flights, than changes in crop condition per se.
Therefore, it is not aIways possible to directly determine the soil moisture status from
canopy temperature. Further research is required to correct imagery for environmental
variables such as solar radiation, air temperature and vapour pressure deficit.
Thermal imagery offers many improvements to current irrigation scheduling
techniques including the facilitation of locating more representative ground sampling
points. Thermal imagery also enables cotton fields on a farm to be ranked according to
their soil moisture status. This then provides farmers with a visual picture of the crop
water status across the whole farm, which is not possible using conventional ground
scheduling techniques. At this stage, airborne video imagery will not replace soil
moisture data collected for irrigation scheduling, however offers potential to enhance
irrigation scheduling methods by addressing the problem of crop variability within
cotton fields.</field><field name="date">1993</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">irrigation</field><field name="subject">cotton production</field><field name="subject">cotton management</field><field name="subject">agronomic measurements</field><field name="subject">airborne video imagery</field><field name="subject">thermal imagery</field><field name="subject">near infrared imagery</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20050801.124927</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigating the condition of organic

impacting on travel agency viability around the world.
Increasing distribution costs have seen travel principals aiming to reach their
customers with distribution that is much more direct than in the past, cutting the travel
agent out of the system, or at the very least, reducing agency commissions. Strategic
alliances have also given suppliers - particularly airlines - marketing synergies, and
again reduced their need to rely on agents to distribute their product. Further
synergies have come from the use of diagonal integration, a process whereby firms
use information technologies to logically combine services for best productivity and
most profitability; for example, Internet booking plus electronic ticketing.
In addition the motivations and consumer behaviour of travellers are changing. The
&amp;64;new tourists&amp;64; want experiences, not just a vacation, are more likely to know what
they want, to do their own pre-purchase research, and to have a stronger preference
for tailor-made arrangements. This market is independent, and more likely to rely on
the Internet as a source of tourism information than to rely on the services of a travel
agent to plan their trip.
This thesis analyses the changes in the travel and tourism distribution system that
point towards the apparent disintermediation of travel agents, and makes
recommendations for new marketing strategies for travel agents, so that they may
retain their viability into the twenty-first century.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">travel agents</field><field name="subject">travel</field><field name="subject">tourism industry</field><field name="subject">distribution systems</field><field name="subject">marketing synergies</field><field name="subject">Internet booking</field><field name="subject">electronic ticketing</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20050726.151525</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Identifying and overcoming barriers to the implementation of student development programmes in ACT high schools</field><field name="creator">Goodwin, Maryna</field><field name="description">My study is of the provision of career education, health education, personal development
and student development programmes for students from Years 7 to 10 in ACT high
schools.
My purpose was to identify why these programmes are not available to all students and
what can be done to make them available.
The methods I used were an examination of a longitudinal case study of "Bellbird" High
School in parallel with a survey of the current system perspective.
Although the study focuses on the ACT in Australia, reference is made to the international
literature, as well as local, regarding the attitudes of students, parents and teachers to
career education, health education, personal development and student development
programmes; data collection and interpretation; and the implementation of change.
I have used data from three different survey instruments administered at "Bellbird" High
School, at five year intervals, in 1978/79, 1984 and 1989. I have used another instrument
at system level twice, in two consecutive years, in 1988 and 1989. Each of the
instruments was developed for a specific purpose and not for gathering data for this
study.
All three surveys at "Bellbird" High School were designed to determine the attitudes of
students, parents and teachers to aspects of the curriculum. They provided both
quantitative and qualitative data.
Basically, I have compared the 1979 and 1989 numerical data, and used the 1984 material
for confirmation of significant issues. In addition to using qualitative data from these
three instruments, I have also used comments from curriculum committee and School
Board documents and evaluation reports from the Living Skills Programme.
At system level, a questionnaire was designed to gather data about the provision of career
education and health education in high schools in the ACT. This instrument, included
questions about barriers to these programmes and strategies for overcoming the barriers.
The findings were distributed to the schools. The procedure was based on the 'Research,
Development and Diffusion' model.
People associated with the successful implementation of the programmes under
investigation were interviewed to find out what barriers they had faced, how they
overcame them and what suggestions they had for overcoming other baniers to these
programmes.
Using the data CO-jointly with the literature and my own knowledge of cumculum
implementation, I have proposed an action plan for "Bellbird" High School to extend the
provision of its student development programme to all students.
In conclusion, the suitability of the proposed action plan for use in other ACT high
schools is appraised and general principles for the system are drawn out.</field><field name="date">1990</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">student development programmes</field><field name="subject">ACT</field><field name="subject">high schools</field><field name="subject">Australian Capital Territory</field><field name="subject">career education</field><field name="subject">health education</field><field name="subject">personal development</field><field name="subject">Bellbird High School</field><field name="subject">Living Skills Programme</field><field name="subject">barriers</field><field name="subject">curriculum</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20050801.165422</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Creating histories and spaces of meaningful use: toward a framework of foreign language teaching with an emphasis on culture, epistemology and ethical pedagogy</field><field name="creator">Kraus, Harald A</field><field name="description">This thesis arises out of a critique of the way language is decontextualized and
presented from a reductively linguistic viewpoint in foreign language instruction. In
particular, it focuses on the weaknesses of the broad approach known as
Communicative Language Teaching (CLT) and highlights the disparity between its
theoretical assumptions and practical applications. With this in mind, the thesis
identifies and explores three foundational premises that should be considered as part
of an attempt to design a theoretically coherent framework for foreign language
instruction. By applying three sets of principles based on these premises, the thesis
goes on to outline such a framework.
After providing a background to the study, the first consideration is the nature of
cultural and communicative performance. The study turns to sociological concepts
regarding cultural organization and production, in order to better conceptualize how
'culture' can be understood in the context of foreign language learning. The second
part of this area focuses on meaning and communication in order to undermine
current treatments of 'language' in foreign language pedagogy.
The second area of interest is that of learning and thus considers a number of theories
of how people learn. The focus here is on learning-in-general rather than learning
languages specifically. What emerges from this are a number of principles that should
be borne in mind when creating conditions favorable to language learning.
Finally, one largely overlooked area in foreign language learning and applied
linguistics more broadly, is how the field of foreign language pedagogy constructs
and legitimizes its practices, as well as suppresses its foundational theoretical
assumptions in its activities (including research, methodology and teaching). A
chapter is therefore devoted to this issue, and a set of principles is formulated in order
to ensure that the design of any instructional framework is honest and ethical.
Thus furnished with the triangulation of principles, an attempt is made to outline how
a learner-focused, ethical pedagogical framework that stresses culture might look.
This thesis is theoretical in nature and relies on arguments and positions from diverse
and less commonly considered academic fields in foreign language instruction. Its
main theoretical inspiration comes from concepts and claims generally considered
'poststructural' or 'postmodern'. However, there is no exclusive devotion to any
particular author or theory.
It is hoped that this thesis can make a genuine, if not controversial, contribution to the
field of foreign language teaching by initiating a dialogue concerning the (lack of)
philosophical and epistemological reflexivity in the field.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">epistemology</field><field name="subject">ethical pedagogy</field><field name="subject">Communicative Language Teaching</field><field name="subject">CLT</field><field name="subject">foreign language teaching</field><field name="subject">communication</field><field name="subject">learning</field><field name="subject">language learning</field><field name="subject">language teaching</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20050803.081504</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Constructing Australian soccer: the media's influence on soccer's position
within the Australian culture</field><field name="creator">Whittington, Joshua</field><field name="description">Despite soccer being arguably the world's most popular sport, Australia's
national soccer competition has consistently failed to attract the prolonged
mainstream support that is given to the comparable rugby league, Australian
Rules football and rugby union competitions. This is a puzzling situation
considering Australia's British lineage, soccer's British origins and the
game's pre-eminent international status. Indeed, soccer's lowly position in
Australia is paradoxical given the sport's historically dominant status in
Britain and Australia's traditional adoption of Anglocentric culture. Most
research into the situation has pointed to the sport's inability to shake-off the
adverse effects of a lingering connection to post-World War II immigration
and certain ethnic communities. Soccer has, in the eyes of many, been unable
to access popular culture primarily because it has been viewed by the
mainstream as 'foreign' or inherently un-Australian. The sport has clashed
with traditional notions of national identity even though, historically, the
Australian men's national team has received relatively strong community
support.
Strangely though, there has been little attention paid to the role the mass
media has played in establishing, maintaining and even altering soccer's
position in relation to mainstream Australian culture. While some
researchers, such as Mosely and Hay, have criticised the media's coverage of
violence associated with soccer at the domestic level, there has been no
textual analysis of the mass media's role in soccer's marginal position in
Australian popular culture. Considering that the mass media is critical to the
development, reinforcement and maintenance of culture and has been
implicated in shaping entire professional sporting competitions to its own
ends, this is an area of considerable scholarly neglect. By undertaking a
textual analysis of the mainstream newspaper coverage given to two critical
periods in the history of the Australian men's soccer team it becomes clear
that there is marked divergence between the media's treatment of
internationally-based soccer and domestically-based soccer. This divergence
in coverage has contributed to the development of two distinct mediated
'realities' of soccer, which in turn has influenced the game's ambivalent
place in mainstream Australian culture. First, the media's control over the
news production process has given it the ability to send textual messages that
elevate soccer from its traditional cultural exclusion- and establish the
national team as part of the historically dominant Anglocentric mainstream
culture in Australia. This process has been inextricably linked to the
increasing ethnic diversity of Australia's population and the dominant
culture's efforts to maintain, despite this emerging plurality, the preeminence
of a traditional Australian 'way of life'. Second, the media's
messages have helped to maintain the ascendancy of the dominant culture by
establishing the characteristics of modern day corporatised sport as the
'normal' expectation for soccer's development in Australia. As a result,
soccer's future in Australia is deemed to be limited until it is able to conform
fully to the commercialised and professionalised mode of production that
defines the sport overseas.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australian soccer</field><field name="subject">media influence</field><field name="subject">media coverage</field><field name="subject">commercialised and professionalised mode of production</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20050726.161835</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Teaching reading comprehension to Thai EFL students: Reciprocal Teaching Procedure</field><field name="creator">Wisaijorn, Patareeya</field><field name="description">The main purpose of this study was to examine the effects of strategy training

The strategy-training used was the Reciprocal Teaching Procedure (RTF)
which focused on the four reading comprehension strategies: predicting,
clarifying, questioning and summarizing.
The research study was an experimental one using a single group design.
The participants were thirty-four first year students enrolled in the English

northeastern part of Thailand. Both quantitative and qualitative research
methods were used. The pre-, post- and follow-up reading tests were
employed for quantitative analysis. The students' performances were
analyzed for statistically significant differences immediately at the end of
the ten-week training and in the follow-up test eight weeks after the
training. Qualitative data were collected from students' pre-, post- and

learners at the Canberra Institute of Technology (CIT) during the 1995 academic year,
and to investigate to what extent the information skills component of TAFE open
learning modules influence adult learners' library literacy levels.
To address these issues, a quasi-experimental research methodology was used to
measure library literacy levels at the beginning and, again, on or near course
completion to ascertain whether any change had occurred, through the administration
of a questionnaire. A number of participants were then interviewed to further validate
the responses fiom the questionnaires.
The study attempted to show that though courses claim to address key competencies
in a vocational education and training environment, one component of the key
competencies, the ability to collect, analyse and organise information, was not being
met. That one component was the ability to locate (or collect) information.
No strong correlations resulted fiom the library literacy levels measured and the
degree to which the key competency was addressed within course modules. No
statistical measures were possible due to the small sample population that eventuated,
though it was almost half the original targeted population. No real gain was achieved
in library literacy levels between the pretest and posttest stages of the research for
either the Experimental or Control groups. Though a highly suitable research
methodology, the quasi-experimental research design did have some limitations in this
piece of research. The CIT flexible learning environment at the time of the study
contributed to the limitations of the study.
However, a number of recommendations were made on the basis of the research
results, advocating some strategies that might be implemented to improve the library
literacy levels of learners undertaking open or flexible delivery courses within CIT,
and suggestions to change the research environment to avoid many of the problems
experienced.
The CIT pilot study was the first known formally documented study of library literacy
levels in an Australian TAFE environment of its kind. The study reflects the literature
published at the time of the study. At that time, the research in this field was minimal.
Many publications and research have emerged since 1995 when this study was
conducted, indicating this is an area of great interest.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">library literacy</field><field name="subject">flexible learners</field><field name="subject">Canberra Institute of Technology</field><field name="subject">CIT</field><field name="subject">open learning</field><field name="subject">quasi-experimental method</field><field name="subject">competency based training</field><field name="subject">adult learners</field><field name="subject">lifelong learning</field><field name="subject">distance education</field><field name="subject">information literacy</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20050809.143304</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation into the factors contributing to success in university undergraduate computing courses</field><field name="creator">Baskett, J L</field><field name="description">This study investigated whether a predictive tool developed by authors in the United
States (Konvalina, Stephens and Wileman) could be used with University students in
Australia (in particular the Australian Capital Territory) to predict their success in first
year University computing courses. It also investigated the effect of demographic and past
academic factors in conjunction with, and instead of the predictive test.
The study examined differences in performance between male/female students, English as
a Second Language (ESL)/non-ESL students and full-time/part-time students.
It also examined the effect of all the above factors on the continuing success of students in
the course.
While significant differences in first-time performance were found between ESL and non-
ESL students, no differences were found between the other pairings.
No differences were found between any of the groups in the continuing success in the
course.
The KSW Test, while being an indicator of first year success, was not a strong enough
model to be able to be used as a predictive tool. The demographic and previous academic
data from students recently at High School, in particular, the Tertiary Entrance Score,
level of mathematics studied, and previous computing study, were found to be more useful
as an indicator of success in fust year, explaining 53% of the variation in h a 1 unit score.
In addition, 67% of the variation in continuing success in their course was also explained

(NESB) employees is a major concern for the Government, employers and unions in
Australia. Due to their low levels of English proficiency, NESB employees are often
unable to carry out effectively the required workplace tasks. In the current climate of
rapid change in workplaces, as a result of Award Restructuring, NESB employees
may also lack the communication skills necessary to undertake skill-based training
and, therefore, be further disadvantaged.
In light of these concerns, this study investigated the English learning needs of a
group of NESB non-academic staff at the University of Canberra (UC). It established
that there was a gap between their present levels of English proficiency and the levels
required in their current positions. As a result, these employees are unable to engage
effectively in all communication tasks required in the workplace.
Following a detailed analysis of the current literature on the provision of workplace
English training it is recommended that an English in the Workplace (EWP) program
be provided at the UC for NESB non-academic employees. Specific recommendations

women from the late nineteenth to the late twentieth century. The thesis has two
components: the first examines feminist, psychotherapeutic and socio-legal literature,
examining how knowledge about female victims of male violence has been constituted;
the second analyses memory work conducted with two groups of women exploring
personal meanings about victims and violence.
Each chapter describes pivotal moments in the history of women and violence showing
how seemingly disparate ideas emerged to become precursors of contemporary
knowledge which have given rise to a range of institutional responses to violence. Late
nineteenth-century feminists created new ways of speaking about violence against
women, however, their ideas were incongruent with prevailing discourses of the era.
The advent of Freudian thought also brought about a new language with which to talk
about violence placing the victim of violence firmly under the therapeutic gaze. During
the 1930s and 1940s the founders of victimology utilised Freud's work as evidence for
their proposition that female victims were often complicit in their own victimisation. In
the1970s feminists challenged victim blaming ideology and redefined violence as a
social and political issue. Twentieth century psychotherapeutic discourses tended to
position victims of violence within discourses of psychopathology. However, more
recently survivors have been defined in terms of traumatisation, constituting alternative
possibilities for subjectivity following victimisation.
The memory work used in this study enabled a consideration of the relationship
between discourse and women's understandings of violence. Although remnants of all
the discourses could be found in the women's narratives, some resonating with more
authority than others, no one discourse operated deterministically to totalise
subjectivity. Rather, it is evident that identities associated with survival are complex,
dynamic and fluid.
The legacy of the discourses described in this thesis continues to be apparent in
community attitudes, institutional responses to violence and survivors' concepts of self.
This thesis considers the potential implications of these discourses for women's
subjectivity.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">women</field><field name="subject">male violence</field><field name="subject">nineteenth century</field><field name="subject">twentieth century</field><field name="subject">victims</field><field name="subject">feminists</field><field name="subject">psychotherapeutic literature</field><field name="subject">socio-legal literature</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20050810.164434</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effects of heat on performance in wheelchair shooters</field><field name="creator">Broad, Elizabeth</field><field name="description">Six elite wheelchair shooters undertook a simulated competition of 2 hr duration
under three different conditions: 1. 24-26 &#176;C and 40% humidity (C), 2. 36 &#176;C and
60% humidity (H), and 3. the H condition whilst using simple head, neck and torso
cooling devices (HC). The trials were undertaken at the same time on consecutive
days in a counter-balanced, randomised order. Two shooters were removed from the
H trial at t=75 and t=105 min, respectively, due to tympanic temperature elevations
above 39 &#176;C, but were able to complete the full 2 hr of competition during the C and
HC conditions. Heart rates were significantly elevated for the group during the H
condition compared to C and HC (106 &#177; ll, 80 &#177; 10, 90 &#177; 7 beats.min-' respectively
at t=90 min, p&lt;0.05) as were perceptions of thermal discomfort (6.4 &#177; 0.7, 3.5 &#177; 0.4,
4.8 &#177; 1.0 respectively at t=90 min, p&lt;0.05). These responses were at least partially
alleviated by the use of the simple, yet practical, cooling devices. Practically, this
may improve performance in shooting competitions as it allows more time to fire a
shot between heart beats, and enables shooters to concentrate more easily on the task
required of them. Responses to heat exposure were more pronounced in athletes
with a higher level of disability (CS versus T4 versus cerebral palsy), and those who
wore heavy leather shooting jackets (rifle versus pistol shooters). Although further
research is recommended, it would appear that the rules governing shooting attire
and prolonging exposure to heat should be reconsidered for events in which
wheelchair athletes compete.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">effects of heat</field><field name="subject">performance</field><field name="subject">wheelchair shooters</field><field name="subject">wheelchair athletes</field><field name="subject">rifle shooters</field><field name="subject">pistol shooters</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20050811.091344</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Communicating about employment: a case study of the experience of unemployed youth in the Canberra community</field><field name="creator">Poroch, Nerelle</field><field name="description">This study is about the risk of youth unemployment in Canberra. It applies the
perspective of Giddens and others on risk communication to how the hazards of self
identity and self esteem, coping ability, the work ethic, family support and level of
education, the ability to enjoy spare time, drugs and alcohol use, poverty and suicide
affect young people's ability to cope. The study's communication perspective also
integates political with organizational, interpersonal and network as well as mass
media communication. The study also draws from scholars who write from a
sociological and psychological viewpoint and are frequently cited in communication
sources.
The loss of traditional work opportunities in the Public Service in Canberra is a
significant barrier to a young person's integration into the community. Other barriers
are the reduced work opportunities for young unskilled workers in a fledgling private
market, the lack of adequate social and transport facilities, and family breakdown that
can leave young Canberrans abandoned. The added factor of a global decline in
participation in work in the last two decades has resulted in the general collapse in the
full time jobs market, a growth of part time and casual employment, multiple job
holding, and non-standard hours of work.
Using historical research, participant observation, interview data and newspaper
content analysis the study shows that the risk of unemployment for young people
remains high notwithstanding the reduction in the overall unemployment rate. The
media has played a significant role in forming community attitudes since the 1974
recession to the new millennium - a time of increasing government hardline policies
towards welfare reform. Such policies have resulted in semi-privatisation of the
employment services and tightening of welfare eligibility. Poor communication of
these policies and coordination of their service delivery has resulted in public confusion
about accessing these services. This is exacerbated in varying ways at the individual
level depending on the extent that young people are affected by the hazards of
unemployment.
The government's answer to the problem of youth unemployment seeks to force young
people to return to school and the family home. The outcomes of other reforms, such
as the mutual obligation component of work for the dole, are yet to be determined.
Young people want to work. However, the consequences of the present government
reforms for young people are that they are 'parked' in education, denied access to full
time employment and the privileges of adult status. All of these issues are reflected in
the findings of the five research questions posed in the study detailed as follows:
Research Question 1: What role does interpersonal communication play in the
construction of a positive sense of self-concept among young unemployed people?
Findings: Young people are vulnerable to social change. At the individual level, the
risk of unemployment and its associated hazards is heightened when an individual's
sense of self and identity is not properly developed and they are unable to forge a sense
of belonging with society. Reduced job opportunities, lack of trust despite the strong
will do to the 'right thing' have prevailed amongst the young. For some access to
choice is exciting. For others who are overwhelmed or have dropped out the world can
be a bleak place. For an increasing number of young people the absence of family
support and education impinges on their interpersonal communication skills in
developing coping strategies in their day-to-day existence outside society's norms of
acceptance.
Research Question la: How important is a positive sense of self-concept for young
unemployed people in communicating with community support organizations?
Findings: A positive sense of self-concept is paramount for young people
communicating with Centrelink and the Job Network organizations in an environment
where they are required to contribute extra effort in finding work, reduce their use of
social assistance, adopt compliant behaviours towards the government's welfare
reforms and meet raised expectations in finding employment.
Research Question 2: How do young unemployed people differently experience their
primary and secondary social support networks?
Findings: Family support as well as education increases the ability of young
unemployed people to interact with their primary and secondary social support
networks. Consequently, a poor experience of primary support leads to eventual
confusion when dealing with organizations that deliver employment services. The
replacement of family support by a friendship group can nevertheless be empowering
in these circumstances.
Research Question 2a: How does young people's ability to access secondary support
networks affect their experience of unemployment?
Findings: The lack of family support and education increases the chances of having
low resilience, low trust in organizations and other people and an inability to cope.
These are all significant barriers to communicating successfully with secondary support
networks that provide assistance with employment opportunities. Staying in education
is a safety net against youth unemployment. The feeling of connectedness with the
community is difficult because of the loss of identity and the absence of identity
recognition for young unemployed people through discrimination. The maintenance of
the work ethic in the main stems from the desire to accrue material benefits.
Research Question 3: What is the role of community and organizational support for
young people experiencing the hazards of unemployment?
Findings: The findings of the study highlight the vulnerability of young unemployed
people accessing organizational support with the hazards stated in the study being the
intervening variables. It was found that reforms linking markets and networks make
increasing demands on the unemployed and their families. Poor communication within
Centrelink, interorganizationally with the Job Network providers and in public
communication informing about such reforms has resulted in confusion amongst young
unemployed people. The new market driven environment has had detrimental effects
on clients because of the lack of integrated programs and has generated a lack of trust
in organizational providers.
Research Question 4: What is the role of the media and public opinion polls
informing community perceptions about youth unemployment?
Findings: Media agenda setting provides the cues setting the standards by which the
public evaluates government and attributes responsibility for societal problems. Public
opinion is formed when media reports on public affairs. People talk to one another
about the topic and consequently public opinion is formed. In the 1970s the media
framed unemployed youth as 'dole bludgers' and the polls reflected public attitudes
that unemployment was due to people not wanting to work. Media framing in the
1990s contrasted with the 1970s view. Such indications included that it now
considered that young people were priced out of a job whilst showing cynicism of
governments to improve the situation. It did not use the 'dole bludger' tag. Although
the salience of youth unemployment in the opinion polls had diminished, it was still a
dominant consideration. Sympathy for young unemployed people who are seen as
victims of social change by the media has maintained into the new millennium with
media criticism aimed at the government's punitive approach to youth unemployment.
Research Question 5: How are policies about youth unemployment communicated to
the community?
Findings: Following Foucault the study found that government is a broader process
involving more than the state. From depth interviews with organizational

should be bottom up - community, state, federal - before Cabinet consideration.
Political and economic ideologies currently precede pragmatism and there is a
diminished voice of those representing youth policy.
These findings contribute to building on understandings of the phenomenon of youth

Canberra Licensed Club. Through a case study approach, it explores how
effectively the Canberra Southern Cross Club communicates with its staff and its
membership within the framework of its own unique culture. At the same time the
Club is exposed to social, economic and technological changes which all have an
impact on the Club's culture.
Using historical research and interview and survey data, the author shows how the
Club's unique sense of place and definition has set it apart from other Licensed
Clubs in the significant emphasis it places on community assistance and
involvement, and the strong commitment to female and family membership. The
nature of the organisational culture is such that the staff have responded to the
needs of the Club culture in attaining high performance standards. The
membership is the highest of any Licensed Club in Canberra. Members
interviewed in the study expressed a sense of belonging to the Southern Cross
Club, so important in an environment where there is evidence of break down of
social cohesiveness at the local community level. This is due to the social
interaction of the Club's social and sports groups which act as informal
communications networks for the Club members. The Club has also developed the
characteristic of remaining close to the members in learning what they want and of
catering to them with the result that it has enjoyed productivity, profitability and
stability over a long period of time.
The culture of the Club has been influenced by various changes, particularly since
the late 1970s. Flow-on benefits have occurred for members in the way the Club
has managed these changes which has resulted in the adoption of a more
commercial and innovative approach. This has enabled the Southern Cross Club
to keep pace with other large Licensed Clubs in the industry. However, it has not
compromised the Club's attitude towards the family and the dignity of the
individual. Its strong commitment to providing opportunities for social interaction
is a facet of club life not always appreciated by the wider community.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">organisational communication</field><field name="subject">Canberra</field><field name="subject">Australian Capital Territory</field><field name="subject">ACT</field><field name="subject">Canberra Southern Cross Club</field><field name="subject">social interaction</field><field name="subject">culture</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20050819.105016</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Agencification in the Australian Public Service: the case of Centrelink</field><field name="creator">Rowlands, David</field><field name="description">Agencification-the creation of autonomous agencies within the public
service-has been occurring in many jurisdictions. It has usually had a
rationale of improving the way in which government works. Generally,
agencies are expected to provide more flexible, performance-oriented,
responsive public services. The purpose of this work is to examine a
particular example of agencification in the Australian Public Service (APS)
and to compare it analytically with similar occurrences elsewhere.
Specifically, it will examine the splitting of the former Department of Social
Security (DSS) into two separate organisations, a policy department and a
service delivery agency operating under a purchaser-provider arrangement,
Centrelink. It will do this in the context of theories of agencification and of
practical experience of agencification elsewhere. It will analyse why
agencification has happened in this case and what the experience has shown,
focusing on the role, governance, accountability and prospects for the new
arrangements. This, the most prominent and substantial case of
agencification in the Australian government, will be compared with the
agencification experience reported in other jurisdictions-the United
Kingdom and New Zealand. It will address why Centrelink came about,
what the outcome has been of the change in institutional arrangements, and
what the likely future is of the Centrelink arrangements. It will show that,
when examined closely, the mechanisms bringing about agencification have
been diverse. However, there are parallels in the experience. This leads to a
conclusion that the current Centrelink arrangements are not stable in the
long term, and some aspects-such as the purchaser-provider
arrangement - should be set aside.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">agencification</field><field name="subject">Centrelink</field><field name="subject">Australian Public Service</field><field name="subject">APS</field><field name="subject">Department of Social Security</field><field name="subject">DSS</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">United Kingdom</field><field name="subject">purchase-provider arrangement</field><field name="subject">government agencies</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20050819.113849</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effect of enhanced electronic access to information on academics' patterns of scholarly communication at the Australian National University</field><field name="creator">Milne, Patricia A</field><field name="description">This study examined the effect of enhanced electronic access to information
on patterns of scholarly communication. Using a panel typology, the
academics at the Australian National University were surveyed in 1991 and
again in 1994, with the data collected by means of mailed questionnaires.
The research drew on the literature of scholarly communication and
information-seeking behaviour. Principles of systems theory were used to
explain the changes taking place within the academics' environments,
including both the system of scholarly communication and the culture of the
three disciplinary groupings: science, social science and the humanities. Three
research questions directed the study focussing on the effect of enhanced
electronic access to information on the academics' use of the library and on
their patterns of information seeking and dissemination.
Results found that between 1991 and 1994, while some aspects of
communication technologies - such as email - had been almost universally
adopted, overall, few changes had taken place in academics' information
related behaviour. Scientists were more likely to have adopted the new
technologies than social scientists or scholars from the humanities. However,
there was strong evidence that a small group of academics were adopting the
new technologies with enthusiasm suggesting that the overall pattern of use
would change in the future.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">enhanced electronic access</field><field name="subject">Australian National University</field><field name="subject">ANU</field><field name="subject">information access</field><field name="subject">scholarly communication</field><field name="subject">systems theory</field><field name="subject">academics</field><field name="subject">library</field><field name="subject">humanities</field><field name="subject">social sciences</field><field name="subject">science</field><field name="subject">panel typology</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20050819.124920</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Relations of power and competing knowledges within the academy: creative writing as research</field><field name="creator">North, Sue</field><field name="description">The aim of this thesis is to explore the politics of discourse within Australian universities with particular reference to the position of creative writing as a research discipline. My thesis argues that some discourses have more power than others, with the effect that some forms of knowledge are seen as valid research and others as invalid, at least in research terms. Academic research has been increasingly dichotomised in the short history of research in Australian universities through issues of public versus private funding, and university concern for sector autonomy. The growing influence on university research, stemming from a global market economy, is one that privileges applied research. Creative writing&#65533;s position within a basic/applied dichotomy is tenuous as its practitioners vie for a place in the shrinking autonomous research sector of universities. I show the philosophical understanding of creativity (with specific reference to creative writing) from a historical perspective and explore this understanding in the current climate. This understanding of creativity confounds creative writing&#65533;s position as research, for this highlights the obstacles faced in certifying it as a valid form of knowledge. I investigate the current status of creative writing in the area of university research in relation to research equivalence, and examine the terminology, the social structures and individual experiences surrounding creative writing as a form of research.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">creative writing</field><field name="subject">Australian universities</field><field name="subject">university research</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20051025.121424</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A cognitive-behavioural therapeutic approach to anger management in adolescent males</field><field name="creator">Mahoney, Janine</field><field name="description">The present investigation evaluated the efficacy of a Cognitive-Behavioural
Therapeutic Approach for the anger management of three adolescent males. The study
is noteworthy because it utilised essential features of Beck's Cognitive Therapy in the
cognitive restructuring phase of treatment. Previous studies have commonly employed
Rational Emotive Therapy's disputation of irrational beliefs for this phase. For this
reason it is considered to be an original contribution to the literature.
A multiple (three) single-case study research design was employed. The three
adolescents, aged 13 to 17 years, attended seven to nine one-hour counselling
sessions over a two to three month period. Pre-, post-treatment and long-term followup
psychometric measures of aggression and anecdotal reports of anger-control were
obtained from parents and teachers. Self-reports in the affective and cognitive domain,
progress in therapy, psychometric measures (aggressive behaviour subscale of the
Child Behaviour Checklist, Adapted Novaco Anger Inventory and Piers-Harris
Children's Self-Concept Scale) and continuous (including pre-, post-treatment and
long-term follow-up) assessments of the frequency of angry outbursts were obtained.
Counsellor assessments of cognitive homework and behaviour in therapy were also
made.
Results reveal marked reductions in the average daily frequencies of angry
outbursts in all cases by post-treatment and treatment effects were maintained
throughout the three-month follow-up period.
It was concluded that the cognitive-behavioural therapeutic approach warrants
further investigation as it is proposed that it is a comprehensive and efficacious
treatment for male adolescent anger problems.</field><field name="date">1993</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cognitive-Behavioural Therapeutic Approach</field><field name="subject">anger management</field><field name="subject">Beck's Cognitive Therapy</field><field name="subject">cognitive therapy</field><field name="subject">Child Behaviour Checklist</field><field name="subject">Adapted Novaco Anger Inventory</field><field name="subject">Piers-Harris</field><field name="subject">male adolescents</field><field name="subject">psychology</field><field name="subject">counselling</field><field name="subject">anger treatment</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20050816.090756</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Changes in teachers' classroom practice and teaching knowledge and beliefs, resulting from participation in a workplace based learning professional development activity</field><field name="creator">Morrissey, Chris</field><field name="description">There are many recognised forms of teacher professional development
ranging from simply reflecting on a lesson recently taught to enrolling in a
formal course at university. This study set out to examine the perceived
effectiveness of one mode of professional development, a spaced learning
activity(SLA).
The SLA was selected for a number of reasons. Firstly, current government
economic and industrial policy includes an emphasis on the training and
retraining of the Australian workforce as an economic necessity. Within this
policy, teacher professional development is considered to improve the
quality of teaching and to raise professionalism. Secondly, the literature in
the area suggests that professional development activities have the potential
to improve the quality of teaching by enhancing teachers' knowledge and
skills. Thirdly, an SLA appeared to incorporate many characteristics of
effective professional development which are identified in the literature, for
example, allowing time for critical reflection and for internalising concepts.
This study sought to determine the effectiveness of an SLA as a training
strategy and in enhancing teachers' knowledge, beliefs, classroom practice
and students' learning outcomes and also to identify characteristics of an
SLA which assisted and inhibited its effectiveness. Perceived costs and
benefits of participation to the individual teacher were also evaluated..
The study was carried out at Marist College, Canberra , a Y7-12 single sex
secondary school with an enrolment of approximately 1100 boys. The
study involved twenty five teachers who participated voluntarily in a pilot
collegial group programme at the school during 1993.
The term "collegial group" is used for a small group of professionals who
meet on a regular basis to learn together and to support one another in their
on-going professional development. Adie (1988:4) explains that collegial
groups are designed to assist in supporting, learning, problem solving,
planning and performing.
The twenty five volunteers were divided into three groups. Each group
determined its own 'focus1 and met on an average of five occasions over six
months, for meetings ranging from two to four hours. The foci selected by
each group were:
Increasing student motivation
Increasing student responsibility for learning.
Excellence in Teaching course.
Meetings usually provided an opportunity for individual feedback on
teaching changes tried, some input on the focus area, discussion of its
practicality and a commitment to try something new and to report back at
the next meeting. Some groups also included discussion of specific
teaching and learning 'problems', where the group would offer solutions.
A variety of data collection techniques were employed in the study. A
questionnaire was conducted before the programme commenced to
ascertain participants' expectations and concerns about the programme and
anticipated effects of participation on their teaching knowledge, beliefs and
practice and on their students' learning outcomes.
A questionnaire was also administered at the end of the programme. The
post-study questionnaire sought participants' perceptions about how well
their expectations for the programme had been met, any differences
participation had made to their teaching knowledge, beliefs and practice,
and to their students' learning outcomes and whether these differences
constituted improvements. Further questions covered: the benefits and
costs to individuals of participation in the programme; the benefits
participants perceived that other non-participatory colleagues could derive
from a future programme; and the perceived value of the activity as a mode
of professional development. The questionnaire also included a table
covering organisational factors of the programme and elicited participants'
responses about the degree to which each assisted and inhibited progress.
In addition to the questionnaires, structured interviews were conducted with
the participants after the completion of the programme asking similar
questions about their perceptions of its success.
Analysis of a variety of data collected through pre and post-programme
questionnaires as well as interviews clearly indicates that this mode of
delivery was perceived by the participants to be an effective form of
professional development from the perspective of changing teaching
knowledge, beliefs and practice, and as a refocussing or confirming activity
by providing stimulus to an individual's professional development. Further
data collected support the organisational characteristics of this SLA and
provide some suggestions for changes. Finally, the findings clearly show
that the benefits to individuals of participation are perceived to outweigh the
costs, further supporting the effectiveness of this mode of professional
development.</field><field name="date">1994</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">professional development</field><field name="subject">perceived effectiveness</field><field name="subject">spaced learning activity</field><field name="subject">SLA</field><field name="subject">Marist College</field><field name="subject">Canberra</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20050816.094627</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Preferences of pupils and teachers for service
delivery of learning assistance
in ACT High Schools</field><field name="creator">Osborne, Sally</field><field name="description">Students who have learning difficulties generate a resource to assist
them with their schoolwork. This resource has been delivered in a number
of different ways. In the last decade the introduction of inclassroom
assistance has been adopted in several states in Australia including the
Australian Capital Territory. This method of service delivery of the
resource has been considered to be helpful as it allows the student to
remain in the classroom while still receiving the necessary assistance.
The proponents of this delivery method believe that the students prefer
remain in the classroom. Critics of this delivery method consider that it
is not easy to address basic skill deficits in the classroom and that
students find being helped in the classsroom embarrassing. This study
examines the preference for service delivery model of three groups of
population, students, classroom teachers and teachers of students with
learning difficulties. A survey was used to ascertain the preference of
these three groups, why they preferred a model, which model they
regarded as most efficacious and why. Other specific questions were
asked of each group. Interviews were also conducted with ten percent of
each group and also with the principal and the counsellor from each
school. Some illumination of school climate and other variables which
may affect data was sought from the interviews. Teachers were found to
prefer a mixed model of service. Students' results showed a preference
for two models over a third, small classes, which was not favoured.
Students also saw these two models as most efficacious. Interviews
revealed a satisfaction with the service amongst students but some
concerns about the delivery of the service and the decision making
processes amongst teachers.</field><field name="date">1993</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">lLearning difficulties</field><field name="subject">ACT</field><field name="subject">secondary schools</field><field name="subject">education delivery</field><field name="subject">learning assistance</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20050816.100411</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Moral education: a critique of stage development

preservice teachers as they enter Early Childhood and Primary Teacher Education
Programmes. The subjects comprised thirty students divided into groups of ten to represent
three levels of mathematics competency as measured on a mathematics competency test.
Evidence of mathematical understanding was gathered from videotaped interviews in which
students were required to provide solutions for a set of six tasks. The analysis of student
performance included monitoring students' ability to provide multiple representations for
tasks as well as the students' demonstration of connections between mathematical ideas.
The results show that preservice teachers entering the Early Childhood and Primary
Teacher Education Programmes at the University of Canberra do so with weak
understanding of many of the mathematical concepts that are fundamental to primary level
mathematics curricula. The type of understanding demonstrated by these students was
predominantly instrumental in nature.
Differences between groups were found with reference to the amount of confidence and
interest displayed during tasks.
The implications of these results on mathematics teacher education are discussed.
The study identifies the need for alternative assessment protocol for mathematics screening

primary schools in the ACT aimed to look at the way
teachers were using computers in classrooms in order to
shed light on the factors which may determine how
teachers chose to use computers to enhance learning. The
case study method allowed the researcher to use
triangulation to provide in-depth information about the
processes involved in the delivery of a lesson using a
computer.
The findings were positive in that more than half of the
teachers were found to be using computers at a high level
of adoption, predominantly running simulation programs.
In most schools, this was in spite of either hardware or
software constraints, inadequate professional development
opportunities or administrative obstacles. Whether the
teachers taught in a laboratory or had one computer in
the classroom did not seem to retard their enthusiasm for
finding the best strategies to effectively integrate
computer use.
Cooperative learning strategies had been adopted by most
of the teachers so their transition to computer use was
made easier since their students had already been
'routinised'.The data also pointed to formal Computer Education as a
possible determinant of a high level computer user.
However, research on a wider scale would be needed to
validate the result.
Differences in the way classes were managed in a onecomputer
classroom and a laboratory were evident.
Teachers spent most time with those students working away
from the computer in the one-computer classroom and most
time with those working at the computer in the laboratory
setting. Methods of evaluation were shown to be
necessarily different depending on whether work was
carried out in a laboratory or a one-computer classroom.
Finally, the study pointed to the need for non-government
schools and system managers to begin long-term planning
for hardware and software purchase and resource
management in order to provide teachers with the tools
needed to integrate computer use effectively. Such
planning would need to include provision for professional
development.</field><field name="date">1994</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">non-government schools</field><field name="subject">primary schools</field><field name="subject">computers</field><field name="subject">professional development</field><field name="subject">computer education</field><field name="subject">ACT</field><field name="subject">Australian Capital Territory</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20050816.150827</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Masculinity in a corporate boys' school</field><field name="creator">Kay, Geoffrey Ernest</field><field name="description">This thesis is a report of a study of masculinity at Canberra
Grammar School, a corporate boys' school. The data were collected
during 1991 and 1992. The thesis questions the conventional wisdom
that a school like Canberra Grammar produces a particular
hegemonic masculinity. Indeed, it identifies the production of a
hierarchy of exalted, multiple masculinities.
There were limitations to what could be investigated in this
study, as well as to how it could be investigated. However, the ideas
and work of several people were blended in order to provide a way
into the questions of masculinity in this school. This eclectic
approach drew upon the literature of Popkewitz, Lather, and Parlett
and Hamilton, who called for narrative descriptions and
interpretation, as well as Beare, Caldwell and Millikan, whose
framework of school culture, albeit modified, provided very rich
information. This method resulted in an emphasis on what was
observed and read within the school, rather than on what might have
been heard, but, nevertheless, a great deal of relevant and useful data
were generated. The data were then interpreted with the help of
questions and insights formed by immersion in the literature on
masculinity and schools, particularly that of corporate boys' schools.
It was possible to identify multiple masculinities in the school,
and arrange them into a hierarchy based on the degree to which each
of them was exalted. These masculinities were fluid and the
hierarchy was dynamic. During the time of the study greatest
support was for "the man as scholar", "the sportsman" and "the man
as leader", three notions of masculinity traditionally associated with
these schools. There was also considerable support for the notion of
"the sensitive man", a notion that has been promoted in schools like
this for many years, but which draws upon traits and qualities less
traditionally associated with these schools. One area of fluidity was
an official move by the school's leaders towards the notion of "the
person", rather than the man. Contestation was evident as changes
occurred within this hierarchy, as well as within the notions
themselves.
These findings are significant for several reasons. Firstly,
they challenge the conventional wisdom about corporate boys'
schools. Secondly, for those working in this school and schools like
it who are searching for ways to bring about different gender and
social relations, the findings offer an encouraging, optimistic picture
of what this school is trying to do. The findings also identify those
within the school who might support or oppose counterhegemonic
practice, as well as areas of the school's culture that should be
targeted in the future. Thirdly, for those wanting to find out about
notions of maculinity in these schools, they show that the method
used here can be very productive, despite its limitations.
The first chapter of this thesis explains the reasons for this
study in more detail, and the second chapter describes and accounts
for the nature of the study. The main body of the thesis is in
Chapters Three, Four and Five, where findings about the school's
setting, curriculum and rituals are described and interpreted. The
thesis concludes with a chapter containing reflections on the reasons
for this study, as well as possible ways forward for those wishing to
investigate questions of masculinity in corporate boys' schools in the
future.</field><field name="date">1994</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">masculinity</field><field name="subject">Canberra Grammar School</field><field name="subject">corporate boys' school</field><field name="subject">gender</field><field name="subject">hegemonic masculinity</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20051108.084123</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Manufacturing audiences?: policy and practice in ABC radio news 1983-1993</field><field name="creator">Dunn, Anne</field><field name="description">This thesis sheds light on the ways in which audiences are made through the relationships between organisational policy and news production practice. It explores the relationships between news practitioners&#65533; perceptions and definitions of audiences, production, and organisational policies, using the radio news service of the Australian national public broadcaster, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC). In so doing, the thesis demonstrates that production, in its institutional context, is a crucial site for the creation of audiences in the study of news journalism. In the process, it illuminates the role of public service broadcasting, in a world of digital media The conceptual framework utilises a new approach to framing analysis. Framing has been used to examine the news "agenda" and to identify the salient aspects of news events. This thesis demonstrates ways in which framing can be used to research important processes in news production at different levels, from policy level to that of professional culture, and generate insights to the relationship between them. The accumulated evidence of the bulletin analysis - using structural and rhetorical frames of news - field observation and interviews, shows that a specific and coherent audience can be constructed as a result of newsroom work practices in combination with organisational policies. The thesis has increased knowledge and understanding both of how news workers create images of their audiences and what the institutional factors are that influence the manufacture of audiences as they appear in the text of news bulletins.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ABC</field><field name="subject">radio news</field><field name="subject">1983-1993</field><field name="subject">audiences</field><field name="subject">Australian Broadcasting Commission</field><field name="subject">news journalism</field><field name="subject">public service broadcasting</field><field name="subject">news frame analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20051123.132051</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Strategic translations: the Zapatistas from silence to dignity</field><field name="creator">Turner, Bethany</field><field name="description">This thesis demonstrates that the discursive strategies that characterise the political struggle of the Zapatista (EZLN) movement are produced in response to the political and economic realities of Mexico and the southeastern state of Chiapas. The EZLN&#65533;s intentionally ambiguous discourse of dignity epitomises these strategies. By deploying various incarnations of dignity to counter the Mexican Government&#65533;s strategic political manoeuvres, the EZLN destabilises the political, economic and social hegemonies of the nation. This destabilisation creates a space for the EZLN to suggest the possibility of an alternative political logic to the Mexican populace. However, the marginalised social location and ethnic diversity of the movement&#65533;s indigenous constituents impedes their ability to effect significant political change. This impediment is overcome when they coalesce around the politically advantageous subjectivity of indigenous Zapatistas and engage with the mestizo Subcomandante Marcos to produce the EZLN. The movement enacts a progressive coalitional politics that articulates radical political alternatives for Mexico through the strategic practice of translation. Thus, translation is posited as a powerful political practice for marginalised groups engaged in resistance struggles in the contemporary global conditions.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Zapatista movement</field><field name="subject">EZLN</field><field name="subject">Mexico</field><field name="subject">ChiapasZapatistas</field><field name="subject">Subcomandante Marcos</field><field name="subject">political change</field><field name="subject">economic change</field><field name="subject">social change</field><field name="subject">lobbying</field><field name="subject">discourse</field><field name="subject">resistance struggles</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20051123.144212</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Bridging the service divide: new approaches to servicing the regions 1996-2001</field><field name="creator">Stephens, Ursula</field><field name="description">This study examines ways in which Australian governments, at national

identifying key indicators of policy successes based on coordinated and
integrated regional services combined with technology-based solutions
that can be adapted to local community needs. The research draws on
new governance theory and principles of effective coordination to propose
a new model for determining appropriate service delivery. This model
highlights the importance of local participation in decision-making, a
regional planning focus, social and environmental sustainability, and the
engagement of local communities as key determinants of regional policy
success.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">public policy</field><field name="subject">Australian Federal Government</field><field name="subject">NSW government</field><field name="subject">regional services</field><field name="subject">regional development</field><field name="subject">new governance theory</field><field name="subject">regional governance</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20051128.093333</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Lithogeochemichal alteration aound the Century and Elura Zn-Pb-Ag deposits: detecting alteration expressions in deep and near surface environments</field><field name="creator">Whitbread, Michael Andrew Ian</field><field name="description">Exploration companies commonly rely on geochemistry to identify alteration of
distinctive geochemical and mineralogical character, surrounding metal sulphide
deposits that were precipitated from hydrothermal fluids. However, examination of
raw analytical data is prone to error due to closure effects and the difficulty in
removing the effects of background variation in unaltered rocks from the variations
imposed by later hydrothermal alteration. Closure can be avoided by using ratios, or
by utilising mass balance approaches based on fixing volume, mass or concentration
changes between samples of parent and daughter lithologies. Using a parent-daughter
approach is limiting, because only pairs of samples can be compared at any one time
and because an unaltered equivalent must be produced for each sample examined in
this way. Pearce Element Ratio analysis and General Element Ratio analysis (PER
and GER) are not restricted in this fashion, and are more amenable to interrogation of
large data sets. PER and GER are also capable of decoupling background variation
from that variation due to hydrothermal alteration. Furthermore, these ratio methods
are readily applied to commercially derived lithogeochemical assays.
In this study, various analytical methods and interpretive techniques (including PER
and GER) have been applied to identify alteration in rocks around the Century and
Elura Zn-Pb-Ag deposits, and to assess whether primary ore-related alteration effects
can still be identified once altered rocks have been subjected to weathering.
Ratios of trace elements over a conserved element have been used to generate a suite
of pathfinder elements for each deposit. Elements enriched in host rocks around both
deposits include the economic metals Zn, Pb and Ag, along with Rb and Tl. Sodium is
ubiquitously depleted in altered rocks. Other elements in the pathfinder suites are
distinctive to each deposit type, and include a number of major and trace elements
that are added or removed from the rocks around the mineralised zones. For example,
Sb and As are enriched in rocks around Elura mineralisation while Ge and Cd are
enriched in samples around Century deposit.
Iron carbonate development accompanied by potassic alteration, the destruction of
albite and the absence of chlorite are the dominant mineral alteration effects at both
deposits. PER and GER diagrams have been used to quantify the intensity of this
alteration and allow lithogeochemistry to be used to vector towards high intensity
alteration, which is adjacent to Century and Elura mineralisation. These ratio methods
are applied to both visibly and cryptically altered rocks at both deposits, and have a
very high degree of success in classifying alteration in unweathered rocks.
The following simple PER ratios indicate proximity to Elura mineralisation:
Ca/C, K/Al for shales, K/(Al-Na) for siltstones/sandstones.
The following simple PER ratios indicate proximity to Century mineralisation:
Mn/Ti, Mg/Ti and Fe/Ti vs C/Ti, K/Ti vs Al/Ti, K/Ti vs (Al-Na)/Ti.
Pathfinder elements can be overlain onto PER and GER diagrams to aid in ranking the
prospectivity of samples, and to assess mineral hosts for individual pathfinder
elements.
Weathering destroys most indicators of alteration in the Elura area, while alteration
signatures are better preserved in host rocks around the Century deposit.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">silver deposits</field><field name="subject">lead deposits</field><field name="subject">zinc deposits</field><field name="subject">lithogeochemical alteration</field><field name="subject">Century deposit</field><field name="subject">Elura deposit</field><field name="subject">Pearce Element Ratio</field><field name="subject">PER</field><field name="subject">General Element Ratio</field><field name="subject">GER</field><field name="subject">Zn</field><field name="subject">Pb</field><field name="subject">Ag</field><field name="subject">weathering</field><field name="subject">rocks</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20051129.112425</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Trace metal and metalloid accumulation, distribution, and, speciation in Lake Macquarie, N.S.W., Australia</field><field name="creator">Kirby, Jason K.</field><field name="description">THESIS ORGANISATION

This thesis is organised into nine chapters that include seven international and
national publications (six accepted and one submitted for publication). The initial
overview chapter outlines the justification and direction for this thesis. With the
exception of chapter 8 (accepted for publication on the 1st May 2005); all chapters are
exact duplicates of published articles in international and national refereed journals
(chapters 2 to 7). The initial chapters (2 and 3) presents research findings using a
marine fish species, mullet (Mugil cephalus), to measure trace metal bioavailability in
Lake Macquarie, NSW Australia. While subsequent chapters (4 to 8) are presenting
research under taken to improve the understanding of arsenic cycling in marine and
estuarine environments. The final chapter (chapter 9) is a synopsis of the major
findings presented in this thesis. Due to the publication nature of this thesis, an
unavoidable degree of replication exists within chapters (publications).</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">semimetals</field><field name="subject">New South Wales</field><field name="subject">NSW</field><field name="subject">Lake Macquarie</field><field name="subject">trace elements</field><field name="subject">zinc</field><field name="subject">bioavailablity</field><field name="subject">arsenic cycle</field><field name="subject">selenium</field><field name="subject">cadmium</field><field name="subject">copper</field><field name="subject">mullet</field><field name="subject">Mugil cephalus</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20051129.124508</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of weirs on fish movements in the Murray-Darling Basin</field><field name="creator">Baumgartner, Lee Jason</field><field name="description">Dams and weirs are widely implicated in large-scale declines in both the range and abundance of aquatic fauna. Although many factors are involved, such declines are commonly attributed to the prevention or reduction of migration, reductions in available habitat, alteration of natural flow regimes and changes to physicochemical characteristics. In Australia, studies into the ecological effects of these impacts are limited, and have concentrated mainly on species of recreational and commercial importance. Subsequently, the adverse effects of dams and weirs, and suitable methods of mitigation, remain largely unknown for many other taxa. Therefore, the major aim of this thesis is to investigate the ecological effects of dam and weir construction on previously unstudied migratory assemblages of fish and macroinvertebrates in the Murray-Darling Basin. It is anticipated that the results of these studies will feed back into improved management strategies that help arrest the previously observed declines of aquatic fauna. Initially, fish communities were sampled, by boat electrofishing, from both reference sites and downstream of Balranald and Redbank weirs on the lower reaches of the Murrumbidgee River, Australia. Sampling was stratified over large spatial and temporal scales to gain a comprehensive understanding of species most affected by the presence of these two barriers. In general, the weirs obstructed fish migrations during summer and autumn and many species of small-bodied fish such as Australian smelt, western carp gudgeon, fly-specked hardyhead and crimson-spotted rainbowfish accumulated downstream of Balranald Weir. In addition, downstream accumulations of juveniles of larger-bodied species such as bony herring, common carp and goldfish were also detected. Although many previous studies had either documented or hypothesised that upstream migrating fish accumulate downstream of migration barriers, none attempted to quantify the size of such populations. Therefore, a simple but efficient method to estimate the size of migratory populations was assessed at the Balranald Weir site. The application of two commonly used estimation techniques yielded relatively reliable results for seven species that accumulated downstream of the weir. Population size estimates were greatest for most species during summer and autumn, where accumulations as high as 800 fish per day were detected. The largest calculated population size estimates, in addition to the
greatest temporal variation, of any individual species was observed in bony herring. Given the simplicity of the technique and the relative accuracy of population estimates, it was concluded that these methods could easily be applied to other weirs where the size of migratory populations is of particular interest. A study investigating the effects of Yanco Weir on the diets of three migratory percichthyid species, Murray cod, trout cod and golden perch was also conducted. Observed spatial variation in a number of trophic processes strongly implicated Yanco Weir as a major contributor to increased competition among percichthyid species on the Murrumbidgee River. The greater relative abundance of percichthyids from downstream samples, combined with increases in dietary overlap and a greater percentage of empty stomachs, also suggested percichthyids may be significantly affecting the relative abundance of potential prey items such as freshwater prawns and Australian smelt. These significant changes in dietary composition were likely related to migratory behaviour, as these species accumulated downstream of the weir, and could be readily expected at other sites where passage is obstructed. It was suggested that the construction of suitable fish passage facilities would effectively reduce the probability of migratory fish accumulating and, subsequently, potential effects of dams and weirs on trophic processes. Since it was established that dams and weirs of the Murrumbidgee River were significantly affecting migratory fish communities, an innovative but relatively inexpensive fishway design, the Deelder fish lock (after Deelder, 1958), was constructed and assessed for wider application throughout the Murray-Darling Basin. The Deelder lock was effective at mitigating the effects of Balranald Weir by providing passage for a wide range of size classes and species of fish; but importantly, the structure enabled the passage of most species previously observed to accumulate downstream of the structure. Most significant was the ability of the fish lock to pass substantial numbers of small-bodied fish, which were previously not considered migratory, suggesting that these species should be considered when developing options to mitigate the effects of other dams and weirs throughout the Murray-Darling Basin. A significant finding of this study was the realisation that substantially more species and size classes of Australian native fish are migratory than previously thought.
Subsequently, it is recommended that, when designing facilities to mitigate the effects of a dam or weir, the structure of the entire migratory community is considered when developing operating parameters. Various options for mitigating the effects of dams and weirs are discussed, but it was concluded that the construction of effective fishways would be the most appropriate means of restoring migration pathways to Australian native fish. A strategic approach for assessing and adaptively mitigating the effects of dams and weirs is presented and discussed.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">weirs</field><field name="subject">fish movements</field><field name="subject">Murray-Darling Basin</field><field name="subject">dams</field><field name="subject">Balranald Weir</field><field name="subject">Redbank Weir</field><field name="subject">migrating fish</field><field name="subject">Yanco Weir</field><field name="subject">Murrumbidgee River</field><field name="subject">Murray cod</field><field name="subject">trout cod</field><field name="subject">golden perch</field><field name="subject">fish populations</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20051129.142046</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Decade of GPS geodesy in the Australian region: a review of the GDA94 and its performance within a time series analysis of a 10 year data set in ITRF 2000</field><field name="creator">Tiesler, Russell Colin</field><field name="description">The University of Canberra (UC) has been involved in GPS processing since the late 1980s.  This processing commenced with the GOTEX 1988 campaign and progressed through a series of project specific regional campaigns to the current daily processing of a distributed set of continuously operating sites for the determination of precise GPS station positions for user applications.  Most of these earlier campaigns covered only short periods of time, ranging from a few weeks to multiple occupations of a few days to a time over one to two years.

With software developments, these multiple occupations were able to be combined to produce results from which crustal motion velocities could be extracted.  This first became feasible with the processing of the Australian National Network (ANN), which yielded realistic tectonic velocities from two occupations (1992 and 1993) of sites 12 months apart.  Subsequently, this was successfully extended by a further 12 months, with re-occupation of certain sites for a third time in 1994.

Analysis of the results indicated that the accuracy of determining the earth signals improved as the time span from first to last observation was increased.  The same was true also for the determination of the position of global references sites.  However, by current standards the results achieved were poor.

Consequently, the process was extended to combine the results of subsequent campaigns with the original ANN data set.  From 1995 to 1999, campaigns were conducted across Australia, covering many State and tide gauge sites included in the original ANN solution.  These provided additional multiple occupations to improve the determinations for both position and velocity.  UC has maintained a data set of the global IGS sites, commencing with the IGS pilot campaign of 1992.  Daily data sets for those global sites, which contained days common to the regional campaigns, were processed to produce our own independent global orbit and reference frame connection.

The motivation for doing so was fourfold.

&#65533;Firstly, to see if historic data could be reprocessed using current modern software and thus be able to be incorporated in this and other analysts research programs.

&#65533;Secondly, to compare the results of the reprocessing of the original data set using modern software with the original ANN solution and then validate both the solutions.

&#65533;Thirdly, to extend the timespan of observations processed to include more recent campaigns on as many original sites as possible.  This to achieve a stronger solution upon which to base the determination of an Australian tectonic plate velocity model and provide quality assurance on the solution comparisons with re-observed sites.

&#65533;Fourthly, to develop a set of transformation parameters between current coordinate systems and the GDA94  system so as to be able to incorporate new results into the previous system.

The final selection of regional and global sessions, spanning from mid 1992 to late 2002, contained almost 1000 individual daily solutions.  From this 10 year data span a well determined rigid plate tectonic motion model was produced for Australia.  This site velocity model was needed to develop a transformation between the thesis solution in ITRF00 an the GDA94 solution in ITRF92.  The significant advantage of the plate velocity model is that all Australian sites can now have computed a realistic velocity, rather than being given a value which has been interpolated between sites whose velocities had been determined over a one or two year span.  This plate velocity model is compared with the current tectonic motion NNR-NUVEL-1A model and other recently published models.

To perform the comparison between the thesis solution in ITRF00 and the GDA solution in ITRF92 a transformation was developed between the two reference systems.  This set of transformation parameters, in conjunction with the plate velocity model developed, enables site solutions at any epoch in the current ITRF00 to be converted onto the GDA94, and vice versa, with a simple, non-varying seven parameter transformation.

The comparisons between the solutions are analysed for both horizontal position and height consistency.  There were 77 sites whose differences were compared.  The horizontal consistency was within estimated precisions for 75 of the 77 sites.  However, the vertical comparisons revealed many of the single epoch sites, especially in 1992, have inconsistent results between the two solutions.  The heights from this thesis for some West Australian sites were compared with analysis done by DOLA and the height recoveries are very similar, indicating a weakness in the GDA94 solution for some of the single epoch sites.  Some of these differences have been resolved but others are still under investigation.

This thesis describes the repocessing of the original ANN data set, the addition of later data sets, the results obtained, and the validation comparisons of the old and new solutions.  As well as the plate velocity model, transformation is provided which enables the user to compute between the GDA94 system, and any epoch result in ITRF00.

Recommendations are made as to which sites need additional work.  This includes sites which only need further analysis or investigation and those which require further observations to achieve a result which will have acceptable accuracy and reliability.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">GPS receivers</field><field name="subject">plate tectonics</field><field name="subject">geodetic research</field><field name="subject">global positiong system</field><field name="subject">University of Canberra</field><field name="subject">UC</field><field name="subject">Australian National Network</field><field name="subject">ANN</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">ITRF00</field><field name="subject">GDA94</field><field name="subject">ITRF92</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20051202.114435</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Understanding teachers' responses to educational change in ACT high schools: developing professional voice and identity</field><field name="creator">Overton, Deidre</field><field name="description">This research identifies those practices and/or conditions that facilitate (or hinder) school and/or system based innovation in ACT high schools.

treatment of operating leases has attracted considerable comment. However, a review
of the publicly available submissions to this proposal reveals that no one has
addressed the issue in terms of the primary objective of general purpose financial
reports, that is, to provide decision useful information to non-professional investors.
This thesis seeks to redress this gap by providing some evidence of the ability of nonprofessional
investors to evaluate operating leases as they are presented according to
current accounting standards and alternative presentation formats.
The thesis reports the results of an experiment carried out on surrogates for nonprofessional
investors. The main finding is that the vast majority of subjects were
unable to evaluate operating lease information when it was disclosed in the notes,
rather than reported in the body of the Statement of Financial Position. Subjects
consistently relied on reported figures and seemed unable to incorporate information
presented in the notes to the financial reports, even when the links between the notes
and the reported figures were made more obvious than is currently the case.
The finding has a number of implications. It would appear that the existing accounting
treatment of operating leases is the source of a structural information asymmetry, as a
substantial proportion of users were unable to evaluate information relating to
operating leases. This information asymmetry should be removed for reasons of
economic efficiency. The recent withdrawal by non-professional investors from
equity markets shows that non-professional investors will react strongly if they start to
doubt the ability of general-purpose financial reports to provide them with decision
useful information.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">operating leases</field><field name="subject">corporate reports</field><field name="subject">investment analysis</field><field name="subject">nonprofessional investors</field><field name="subject">financial reports</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060203.114404</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Attitudes toward computers in the 1990s: a look at gender, age and previous computer experience on computer anxiety, confidence, liking and indifference</field><field name="creator">Applebee, Andrelyn C.</field><field name="description">The purpose of this study was to investigate the

levels has gathered pace, and accountability of providers has become a byword,
particularly in secondary and tertiary educational institutions. In this process of
meeting societal needs, the teacher's role is crucial to the provision of optimal
conditions for learning. Teachers' adaptation to the changing clientele and
technologies of the 1990's, also demands their flexibility and preparedness to
contemplate anew their role in the learning transaction.
Gage (1963) posed three topical questions about teaching: how do teachers
behave, why do they behave as they do and what are the effects of their
behaviour? The information gained by examining three types of variables, is
required to answer these questions, the most central to research on teaching, is
teaching behaviour, or the process of teaching. Secondly, there are the causes or
determinants of those behaviours or processes and finally, there are the effects or
consequences of the teaching behaviours or processes (Dunkin,1986).
This research into teaching behaviours, conducted in three institutes of Technical
and Further Education in the A.C.T., seeks to determine the quality of teaching
for adult learners and the nature of the learning environment in TAFE. The
design of the study incorporates comprehensive multi-variate instruments and a
triangulating approach to data collection. In particular, a factor analysis of
student questionnaires evaluates the main factors operant in the classrooms of the
selected tertiary environments. The nature of the teaching behaviours and the
contingent learning climate, enabled further conclusions to be drawn about the
implications of these behaviours for adult learners eg. teacher expectancies, not
found hitherto evaluated in a tertiary context.</field><field name="date">1993</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australian Capital Territory</field><field name="subject">ACT</field><field name="subject">adult learning</field><field name="subject">TAFE</field><field name="subject">Technical and Further Education</field><field name="subject">adult education</field><field name="subject">adult education teachers</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060206.132723</field></doc><doc><field name="title">School based management: the Principals' perspective</field><field name="creator">Hanks, Jennifer A</field><field name="description">This study details the background to the establishment
of Parish School Boards in the Archdiocese of Canberra and
Goulburn, and reports and analyses the perceptions of all
ACT Catholic, systemic, primary school Principals who
operated with a Parish School Board in 1993.
The movement towards Parish School Boards finds its
genesis in the Second Vatican Council where the Church was
invited to collaborate in decision-making based on the
belief that all the faithful have gifts, knowledge and a
share of the wisdom to bring to the building of the Church.
The nature and structure of Catholic education was seen as a
suitable vehicle for encouraging communities to engage in
shared decision-making and in participatory democracy under
the Church model of subsidiarity, collegiality and
collaboration.
The introduction of Parish School Boards into the
Archdiocese can be seen as the implementation of a radical
change to the educational mission of the Church and the
educational leadership of the faith community. Reflecting
'new management theory' in both the secular and Church
worlds, a key stakeholder is the school Principal whose role
and relationships change as he or she learns to work within
a team, sharing leadership.
This study examines the responses of nineteen
Principals who were interviewed by the researcher in order
to determine how they work with a Parish School Board and
what effects the board has on their work.
Research studies in the area of School-Based
Management and Shared Decision-Making have informed the
review, and the Principals' responses from this study have
been analysed in the light of secular and Church literature
on leadership, devolution and change.
The respondents of this study, the school Principals,
report the benefits of collegiality and collaboration but
their unresolved tensions relate to work overload, lack of
clarity of the roles and responsibilities of the various
local level decision-making groups, increased administrative
complexity, community demand for ever widening consultation
and the challenge of consensus decision-making.

All Principals report an urgent need for professional
development for themselves and for the system to provide a
more explicit focus on parish and community formation with
the commitment of the necessary resources to sustain this
radical change.</field><field name="date">1993</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Parish School Boards</field><field name="subject">Archdiocese of Canberra and Goulburn</field><field name="subject">Second Vatican Council\</field><field name="subject">Catholic education</field><field name="subject">Australian Capital Territory</field><field name="subject">ACT</field><field name="subject">school management</field><field name="subject">catholic schools</field><field name="subject">school principals</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060207.133742</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Time-in: a logical consequence for misbehaving children in primary school</field><field name="creator">Hertel, Russel</field><field name="description">Time-In, A Logical Consequence for Misbehaving Students,
studied the effects of a primary school discipline program
designed and implemented by a trainee school counsellor. The
program delivered a series of logical consequences for students'
misbehaviour and a formalized entry point for counselling
intervention.
The program was based on a critical incident technique that
required teachers to issue infringement notices to misbehaving
students who failed to respond to warnings or contravened existing
rules regarding safe and responsible behaviour. Counselling and
system responses (loss of privileges, parent notification, in
school suspension, exclusion) occurred within an established
formula dependent on the number of infringements accruing to the
student. The school counsellor assumed full responsibility for
the collection of infringements, monitoring of on-going student
misbehaviour, parental contact and overall management functions of
the host school's discipline program. Counselling sessions and
mode of therapy were selected and employed to meet the specific
needs of misbehaving students once extended misbehaviour patterns
emerged.
Data collected throughout the study's duration (one year)
indicated a decline in the number of recurring offenders and a
drop-off in the number of infringements received by those pupils
who continued to transgress school policies regarding safe and
responsible behaviour. Five hundred and forty-seven infringement
notices were issued during the study which resulted in a total of
83 counselling sessions. Male students dominated all categories
of misbehaviour and accounted for 86% of the infringements issued.
Seventy-seven per cent of infringements issued were from class
teacher to students in the class setting.
Three questionnaires were administered at the end of the
program to teachers, parents and students. Both parent and
teacher questionnaire results supported Time-In procedures but
almost half of the students responded negatively to the
continuation of the program. Several hypotheses were posited for
this outcome.</field><field name="date">1993</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">school discipline</field><field name="subject">school counselling</field><field name="subject">time-in procedures</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060207.140309</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Information for decisionmaking: a case study of tertiary education administrators</field><field name="creator">Ransome, Alison</field><field name="description">This study examines the broad problem of the role of information in decisionmaking by
tertiary education administrators. The purpose of the study is to investigate the
information required by administrators for decisionmaking, to discover patterns of
use, the sources most commonly used, and the effect of environment and context on the
type and source of information. The method chosen to exemplify the research
problem, a case study of one particular tertiary institution, allows for examination, in
depth, of the flow of information and of information seeking behaviour in one unique
organisation. It also affords the opportunity to apply the findings directly to the object
of the study. At the time, the institution was experiencing a period of uncertainty and
change which culminated in its becoming part of a new networked or federated
university.
Three groups of models from the literature guide the study. These relate typologies of
information to decisionmaking; transpose information for decisionmaking into the
higher education context; and relate behavioural and environmental factors to
information. The basis of this case study is a series of semistructured interviews
following an agenda based on the models chosen. Data was analysed by patternmatching
and explanation-building.
Two significant contextual factors are apparent: the first, the high degree of perceptible
uncertainty in the institution's environment; and the second, the idiosyncrasies
of the individual administrator. The case study approach was found to be
appropriate for the unusual organisational circumstances existing at the time.

A critical framework for higher education.</field><field name="creator">Eijkman, Henk</field><field name="description">This thesis aims to contribute to the optimising of the educational engagement of low socio-economic and other historically underrepresented populations in undergraduate, web-based distance learning in higher education. It establishes, through theoretical and philosophical argument, the value of a participative justice approach to equity, a social constructionist epistemological framework for curricular praxis, and a relational conceptualisation of networked computing. The project to re-map the terrains of equity, curricular practice, and web-based distance learning in higher education emerges out of a realisation that current maps are restrictive, epistemologically flawed, and theoretically deficient, thereby inhibiting the educational engagement of disadvantaged students and obstructing systemically equitable outcomes. Without a new curricular map web-based distance learning is likely to maintain, if not exacerbate, distance education&#65533;s historic record as having the highest levels of inequitable outcomes in higher education. In response, the thesis, taking a critical social constructionist stance, problematises current equity, curricular practice, and networked computing discourses in relation to culture, power, and politics. As a critical postmodernist counter-narrative, the thesis proposes paradigm shifts from an access to a participative approach to equity, from an individual to a social learning model for curricular practice in distance education, and from a technocratic to a relational conceptualisation of networked computing. Web-based distance education is positioned as a site of contestation where the need for equity is greatest and the implementation of a new model of curricular practice is most likely to succeed since web-based distance learning is still a newly emerging mode of study in which academics are themselves newcomers in search of effective curricular practices. This leads to the development of &#65533;Critical Interdependent Acculturation&#65533; as a &#65533;next generation&#65533; social constructionist curricular practice for web-based distance learning.

Having established the capacity of networked computing to sustain such a curricular practice, this thesis offers academics a new conceptual architecture, &#65533;Imaginative Designs for Equitable Achievement of Learning&#65533; (IDEAL) to optimise the educational engagement of all students in web-based distance learning in higher education, but especially for those least advantaged. Accordingly, the thesis invites academics to re-evaluate their approach to equity, their epistemic assumptions and to transform rather than transfer old paradigm curricular practices in networked distance learning. The remapping of equity in web-based curricular practices undertaken in this thesis represents a significant contribution to knowledge. The study, by taking a critical postmodernist approach to class, power and social relations, addresses significant research gaps in its theoretical analysis of disadvantaged students in distance education, especially its web-based mode, in which these students are most at risk of educational disengagement. The study targets the operation of social power at the micro-level of curricular practices in higher education and shifts the web-based learning debate from technological access to equitable engagement in its social practices. The reconfiguration of curricular practices to transform the operation of power in mainstream programs positions this study as a groundbreaking project, and by arguing for a systemic curricular response geared towards equitable educational engagement, it affirms that curricular focused research is a significant factor in achieving equity in web-based higher education, rather than being peripheral to it.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">curricular justice</field><field name="subject">online learning</field><field name="subject">higher education</field><field name="subject">equity</field><field name="subject">distance education</field><field name="subject">web-based education</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060308.161006</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The ecology of the red fox (Vulpes vulpes) in the Central Tableslands of New South Wales</field><field name="creator">Berghout, Mani</field><field name="description">The red fox occurs across a very broad range of habitats, and displays great behavioural flexibility under different environmental conditions. In Australia, mounting concern over the impacts of foxes on livestock and native fauna has highlighted a need for more information on fox ecology under Australian conditions as a fundamental step towards developing more strategic means of managing foxes. This study explores ranging behaviour, dispersal, use of dens, activity rhythms, population dynamics and diet in the absence of management in productive agricultural land in the central tablelands of New South Wales. The study was conducted from June 1994 to June 1997 on private property near Murringo, NSW Australia (34&#176;15&#65533; S, 148&#176;30&#65533; E). The site was primarily sheep and cattle grazing land and had a history of no fox management. Rainfall was considerably below average for much of the study. A total of 83 foxes were trapped over 3931 trapnights, of which 50 were fitted with radio-collars (23 adult and 6 juvenile females, 12 adult and 9 juvenile males) and 26 released with eartags only (all juveniles: 10 females, 16 males). Thirty-three foxes were radio-tracked using fixed towers between March 1995 and December 1996, with between 11 and 28 foxes tracked at any time. Mean home range size was 446.1 ha &#177; 69.8 se using 95% Minimum Convex Polygons (MCP), and 276.4 ha &#177; 36.3 se using 95% kernel utilisation distributions. Male home ranges defined by MCP were significantly larger than female ranges, but no significant difference was found using 95% kernels. Core ranges were estimated to be 133.4 ha &#177; 23.7 se using 50% MCP and 59.8 ha &#177; 6.1 se using 95% kernels, with no significant difference between sexes. No significant differences were found between range sizes of adults and juveniles or between years or seasons. While most home ranges were steady for the duration of the study, some foxes were observed to shift range location and 4 foxes displayed nomadic behaviour for at least some of the study. There was a high incidence of overlapping home ranges, most commonly between females or males and females but occasionally between males, but core areas were usually separate. Fully overlapping core areas were observed in 1995 but not in 1996.

Juvenile foxes were significantly more likely to disperse than adults, and usually travelled further (juveniles 61.1 km 31.6 &#177; se; adults 5.9 km 1.1 &#177; se). Males and females were equally likely to disperse, and there was no significant difference in the distance travelled. The furthest distances were 285 km and 140 km, but mean distance of dispersal excluding these animals was 12.3 km &#177; 4.3 se (n = 13). Thorough surveys across a 16.4 km&#178; area located 200 dens, with 68 of these active in 1995 and 96 active in 1996. Density of breeding foxes was estimated to be 0.55 and 0.52 adult foxes/km&#178; in 1995 and 1996 respectively based on natal den counts. Density estimates based on active den counts, which include non-breeding foxes, were 0.91and 1.30 foxes/km&#178; in 1995 and 1996 respectively. These estimates appear lower than other studies in similar habitats but this is likely due to using a half home range boundary strip around the surveyed area in the present study. Application of mark-recapture analysis found very high &#65533;recapture&#65533; rates of dens and gave a similar estimate of the total number of dens to that observed directly. Natal dens were regularly distributed across the study area, whereas active dens tended to be in clusters. There was a high turnover of which dens were used each year, but the total number of natal dens was similar across years (16 in 1995 and 17 in 1996). Natal dens were more likely to be used on repeat occasions than other dens, but not necessarily by the same vixen. Litter size based on sightings of emergent cubs was 2.8. Foxes were predominantly nocturnal, with a major peak in activity about an hour after sunset. A new method of analysing activity rhythm data using Fourier series to mathematically describe animal movements was developed, that allowed systematic identification of the cyclical components underlying overall movement patterns. General fox behaviour could be clearly described by a 24-hour and a 12-hour cyclical component when corrected for variation in daylength. The rising and setting of the sun appeared to be a major trigger underlying movement patterns. Seasonal and sex differences were observed in patterns of activity. The annual rate of increase of the fox population was found to vary around a mean of zero between June 1994 and June 1997. A major drop in fox numbers as estimated by spotlight counts occurred in the second half of 1995, but numbers recovered by the

end of 1996. Kaplan-Meier analysis of radio-tagged foxes found annual adult survival was generally very high (0.56-0.96) with lowest survival between July and October. Causes of mortality were human-related outside the site and apparently of natural causes within the site. However foxes dying of natural causes outside the site were unlikely to be found. There was no overall movement of foxes into or out of the site. Immigration was detected following the drop in fox numbers in late 1995, but there was no evidence of immigration prior to this period although emigration occurred. A sensitivity analysis was conducted on the effects of a small change in life history parameters on finite rate of increase using published data as well as adult mortality data from the present study. The two most influential life-history parameters were adult and juvenile survival, while changes in fecundity and age at first reproduction had much less impact on finite rate of increase. In terms of management, in which fertility control is being considered as an alternative to lethal control, this implies that a small change in fecundity may cause less change in the rate of increase of foxes than lethal control. Foxes were culled in June 1997 on completion of the study. Estimated density using a Petersen estimate was 2.4-5.3 foxes/km&#178; and index-manipulation-index was 1.4-3.2 foxes/km&#178;. The different methods used to cull foxes appeared to target different age groups within the population, and were generally biased in favour of younger foxes. Success at killing animals was low, leading to large standard errors in the population estimates. Stomachs of foxes shot in the Orange district were found to contain predominantly rabbit and carrion, with invertebrates present when abundant. These findings were not strictly representative of the diet of foxes in the study area, where rabbits were scarce. Foxes scavenged heavily on lamb carcasses within the study site. The quantity of fresh lamb carrion removed from a lambing paddock in winter 1996 was estimated to support 13-24 foxes, with available fresh lamb theoretically able to support 240-440 foxes. Density based on removal of fresh carcasses was estimated to be 0.83-1.5 foxes/km&#178;.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">red fox</field><field name="subject">Vulpes vulpes</field><field name="subject">Central Tablelands</field><field name="subject">New South Wales</field><field name="subject">NSW</field><field name="subject">ecology</field><field name="subject">Murringo</field><field name="subject">behaviour</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060331.085450</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Salinity sensitivity in early life stages of an Australian freshwater fish, Murray cod (Maccullochella peelii peelii Mitchell 1838)</field><field name="creator">Chotipuntu, Piyapong</field><field name="description">The Murray cod (Maccullochella peelii peelii Mitchell 1838) is Australia&#65533;s largest freshwater fish. Once highly abundant in the Murray-Darling river system, populations have drastically declined in recent decades. Many causes for this decline have been proposed, including over-fishing, habitat loss and altered river flow regimes. This study hypothesised that elevated salinities have led to selective mortality in some developmental stages, which have in turn depleted stock recruitment and adult populations. The objectives of this study were to determine the optimal, threshold, upper sublethal and lethal salinities for development of eggs, yolk-sac larvae, fry and fingerlings of M. peelii peelii. Investigation the impact of salinity on fertilisation utilised gametes of trout cod (M. macquariensis, Cuvier 1829) instead of M. peelii peelii. Studies were carried out in a controlled laboratory environment using test media prepared from commercial sea salt. The results showed that the eggs of the trout cod hatched only when fertilised and incubated in freshwater, and only larvae hatched in freshwater survived through the yolk absorption period of 12 days. Yolk utilisation efficiencies were not significantly different among the salinities of 0-0.30 g/L. There was no effect of pre- or post- fertilising processes on the salinity tolerances of yolk-sac larvae. No larvae survived at salinities higher than 0.30 g/L during the yolk utilisation period. Lethal salinity concentration in Trout cod and Murray cod larvae was exposure time dependent. The 1 day LC50 of the larvae was 1.97 and 2.33 g/L respectively, compared with the 12 day LC50 values of 0.50 and 0.35 g/L respectively. The threshold (no effect level) salinities of larvae of Trout cod and Murray cod were 0.46 and 0.34 g/L respectively at 12 days exposure. The salinity sensitivities of fry of Murray cod were moderated by increasing pH between pH 6.2 and 8.8, and stimulated by increasing temperatures from 15 to 30&#176;C. The optimal salinity was only slightly affected by temperature. The threshold and upper sublethal salinities varied slightly depending on feeding regime. The salinity sensitivities of fingerlings of Murray cod

were: LC50 = 13.7 g/L; optimal salinity from 4.6 to 5.0 g/L ; threshold salinity from 5.9 to 7.4 g/L, and upper sub-lethal salinity from 9.2 to 9.9 g/L &#65533; with the range in all cases affected by acclimation period salinity. The blood osmolality at LC50 of the fingerlings was 444 mOsmol/kgH2O or equivalent to 14.2 g/L, and the dehydration rate was 4.8%. The osmolality increased significantly in salinities higher than 9.0 and 6.0 g/L when fish were exposed for a period of 1 day and 41 days respectively. The oxygen consumption increased significantly in salinities higher than 8.0 g/L. Distortion of the notochord and corrosive skin syndrome were major symptoms describing sub-lethal effects found in the embryos, and fry and fingerlings of Murray cod respectively. Noting the risks of extrapolating directly from laboratory to field conditions, it is predicted that when salinity in natural habitats increases above 0.34 g/L a significant impact on Murray cod recruitment will result.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Murray cod</field><field name="subject">Australian freshwater fish</field><field name="subject">Maccullochella peelii peelii</field><field name="subject">salinity</field><field name="subject">Murray-Darling Basin</field><field name="subject">larvae</field><field name="subject">trout cod</field><field name="subject">Maccullochella macquariensis</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060331.115030</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Place of Go-Set in Rock &amp; Pop
Music Culture in Australia, 1966 to
1974</field><field name="creator">Kent, David Martin</field><field name="description">This is the first academic examination of the place and history of works produced by
Go-Set Publications in studies of contemporary Australian teenage culture.
Go-Set (Go-Set Publications, Melbourne) is perhaps the single most significant musicbased
newspaper in the history of Australian teenage popular culture. Go-Set reflected
the teenage culture of the period 1966 to 1974, helping create a dynamic
independently thriving Australian rock music scene from 1969. It was independently
owned and operated, set its own agendas and defined its own place in Australian
teenage society.
Go-Set's history is given as a biography (following van Zuilen (1977) in distinct
stages from birth till death, highlighting the important landmarks of its life. In
particular Go-Set led culturally by developing the first National Top-40 song chart. It
provided musicians and non-musicians with weekly updates on the nature of the
Australia's teenage music-based societal culture. It led in the development of a
teenage counter-culture by keeping readers informed about alternative thinking and
ideologies through the views of pop/rock stars, and later, more editorially directly,
through its radical sister publication Revolution.
Go-Set survived because readers continued to support it. It both entertained and
informed. It gave young Australians the necessary knowledge, instruction, and advice
to keep them up-to-date in a changing social scene
To explain why Go-Set was so important to its readers, this thesis postulates a series
of six speculative models describing how readers might have used the newspaper.
These models suggest a process of usage relevant to teenage socialisation, by defining
the criteria for acceptance of Go-Set's content as sets of instructions, or codes, of
particular social relevance, namely the codes of personal life, music, fashion, and
alternative lifestyle. The models postulate some sociological and psychological
reasons for reading Go-Set, and suggest why the magazine was so successful during a
period when other, similar, magazines failed.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Newspapers</field><field name="subject">Go-Set</field><field name="subject">Melbourne</field><field name="subject">Music History</field><field name="subject">Rock History</field><field name="subject">teenage socialisation</field><field name="subject">Zuilen</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20050509.095456</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Coordinating information provision in government agencies using an integrated information management strategy</field><field name="creator">Eccleston, Anthony L.</field><field name="description">The specific aims of this study were determined on a conceptual appreciation that
management of information assets and services in some government agencies was
deficient in meeting both existing and developing demands. This appreciation
manifested itself in a commitment to investigate the principles and processes
intrinsic to existing management methodologies, to relate these processes to the
needs of users, and to determine a strategy which could more ably meet the
information provision requirements of those users.
The achievement of these aims predicated the use of the case study research
method, selecting as the first case study the Department of Human Services and
Health (DHSH), an agency that had recognised that a problem existed in the
provision of information services, and had initiated action to address that
problem. As a counter, the Department of Defence, an agency which adrmts to a
problem, but which had yet to initiate an active, global program for its resolution,
was chosen as the second case study.
A theoretical model, which reflects extant international thinking and practice, was
initially constructed in order to establish a basis on which to ascertain and
evaluate the information management circumstances of the two case study
departments. This model specified the objectives considered to be fundamental
to effective information management in a public service environment. It included
studying the foundation repositories of information services from which
information in the portfolio domains of government are sought. These services
are the traditional records centres or registries, the library services which provide
a repository of published and grey material in printed, image and magnetic
formats, and the computerised networks holding electronic records at varying
levels of development.
An analysis of findings was carried out separately on each case study agency
before bringing the data together for cross-case analysis. In order to maximise
the veracity and validity of the data collected and its subsequent interpretation by
the researcher, the draft analysed case study findings were submitted to the
respective agencies for review and critique. All matters of substance received
have been incorporated in the final version.
The findings from the two case studies and the cross-case analysis confm that,
despite significant advances in some specific agencies, the initial hypothesis that
government agencies are still deficient in providing optimum services to meet the
information needs of users, is demonstrated. The advances that have been made,
however, similarly support the other thesis hypotheses that the implementation of
an integrated information management strategy in any government agency will
provide a foundation for improved information provision and the timely delivery
of relevant available information to the user.
Finally, a model of optimum processes involved in such a strategy, derived from
the theory and practical products of this study, is offered. This could be the
subject for future evaluation and testing for realistic and functional application.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">information resources management</field><field name="subject">administrative agencies</field><field name="subject">information technology</field><field name="subject">Dept of Human Services and Health</field><field name="subject">DHSH</field><field name="subject">Dept of Defence</field><field name="subject">Australian government agencies</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060404.123006</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The development of enhanced information retrieval strategies in undergraduates through the application of learning theory: an experimental study</field><field name="creator">Macpherson, Karen</field><field name="description">In this thesis, teaching and learning issues involved in end-user information
retrieval from electronic databases are examined. A two-stage model of the
information retrieval process, based on information processing theory, is
proposed; and a framework for the teaching of information literacy is
developed.
The efficacy of cognitive psychology as a theoretical framework that enhances
the understanding of a number of information retrieval issues, is discussed.
These issues include: teaching strategies that can assist the development of
conceptual knowledge of the information retrieval process; individual
differences affecting information retrieval performance, particularly problemsolving
ability; and expert and novice differences in search performance.
The researcher investigated the impact of concept-based instruction on the
development of information retrieval skills through the use of a two-stage
experimental study conducted with undergraduates students at the
University of Canberra, Australia. Phase 1 was conducted with 254 first-year
undergraduates in 1997, with a 40 minute concept-based teaching module as
the independent variable. A number of research questions were proposed:
1. Wdl type of instruction influence acquisition of knowledge of
electronic database searching?
2. Will type of instruction influence information retrieval effectiveness?
3. Are problem-solving ability and information retrieval effectiveness
related?
4. Are problem-solving ability and cognitive maturity related?
5. Are there any differences in the search behaviour of more effective and
less effective searchers?
Subjects completed a pre-test which measured knowledge of electronic
databases, and problem-solving ability; and a post-test that measured changes
in these abilities. Subjects in the experimental treatment were taught the 40
minute concept-based module, which incorporated teaching strateges
grounded in leaming theory. The strategies included: the use of analogy;
modelling; and the introduction of complexity. The aims of the module were
to foster the development of a realistic concept of the information retrieval
process; and to provide a problem-solving heuristic to guide subjects in their
search strategy formulation. All subjects completed two post-tests: a survey
that measured knowledge of search terminology and strategies; and an
information retrieval assignment that measured effectiveness of search design
and execution.
Results suggested that using a concept-based approach is significantly more
effective than using a traditional, skills-demonstration approach in the
teaching of information retrieval. This effectiveness was both in terms of
increasing knowledge of the search process; and in terms of improving search
outcomes. Further, results suggested that search strategy formulation is
significantly correlated with electronic database knowledge, and problemsolving
ability; and that problem-solving ability and level of cognitive
maturity may be related.
Results supported the two-stage model of the information retrieval process
suggested by the researcher as one possible construct of the thinking
processes underlying information retrieval.
These findings led to the implementation of Phase 2 of the research in 1999.
Subjects were 68 second-year undergraduate students at the University of
Canberra. In this Phase, concept-based teaching techniques were used to
develop four modules covering a range of information literacy skills,
including: critical thinking; information retrieval strategies; evaluation of
sources; and determining relevance of articles. Results confirmed that subjects
taught by methods based on leaming theory paradigms (the experimental
treatment group), were better able to design effective searches than subjects
who did not receive such instruction (the control treatment group). Further,
results suggested that these teaching methods encouraged experimental
group subjects to locate material from more credible sources than did control
group subjects.
These findings are of particular significance, given the increasing use of the
unregulated intemet environment as an information source.
Taking into account literature reviewed, and the results of Phases 1 and 2, a
model of the information retrieval process is proposed.
Finally, recognising the central importance of the acquisition of information
literacy to student success at university, and to productive membership of the
information society, a detailed framework for the teaching of information
literacy in higher education is suggested.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">information retrieval</field><field name="subject">learning theory</field><field name="subject">information literacy</field><field name="subject">University of Canberra</field><field name="subject">research methodology</field><field name="subject">teaching strategies</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060405.130648</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Personal perspectives of learning difficulties</field><field name="creator">Wood, Maureen</field><field name="description">The purpose of the study was to develop a greater understanding of the experiences
of school life for students who consistently found learning difficult, their
perceptions of the difficulties they faced with their learning and how this had
influenced their lives, socially and academically. It was hoped that their
perspectives would highlight those structures and strategies that were of the most
value in supporting them, as well as those that had a negative impact on their
achievement and adjustment.
Eight people with learning difficulties each participated in a series of three
individual, in-depth interviews about their experiences of school. The participants,
five male and three female, ranged in age from ten to twenty five years. Four were
primary school students, in Years Four, Five and Six. Two students were in Year
Nine at high school, while a further two participants had completed their
schooling. One was currently unemployed, while the other had completed a
university degree and had been teaching for three years.
Participants were chosen from randomly selected government schools in the ACT,
nominated by the school as fitting the selection criteria. Learning difficulties were
defined in tenns of their meeting criteria that were indicative of teacher and parent
concern for academic underachievement over a period of at least two years. The
selection process was also guided by criteria to locate key informants, i.e.
individuals who may have been able to highlight specific issues related to the
relationships between learning difficulties and socioeconomic status, social
competence and employment opportunities.
Interviews with each participant .took place over three separate sessions of
approximately fifty minutes' duration. Data was analysed using Hycner's guidelines
for phenoinenological analysis. Interviews were transcribed and coded, with an
independent researcher validating identified themes. An agreement rate of 88%
was achieved. Interviews were then summarised and returned to the participants to
confirm whether the interpretation of their perspectives was accurate. Themes that
were common across the interviews were discussed in relation to current research.
The results of this research study confirmed the central role played by quality
teachers and best teaching practices in being able to enhance learning and to meet
the needs of individual students. These factors were an integral part of engaging
students in the learning process and promoting successful learning experiences.
The study also emphasised the importance of parents, particularly mothers, in the
adjustment of the participants to the everyday demands, academic and social, of
school life. The necessity of establishing and sustaining effective early intervention
programs was also highlighted, as was the value of listening to the voices of
individuals with learning difficulties when making decisions on their behalf.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">learning difficulties</field><field name="subject">government schools</field><field name="subject">Australian Capital territory</field><field name="subject">ACT</field><field name="subject">Hycner's guidelines</field><field name="subject">phenomenological analysis</field><field name="subject">learning ability</field><field name="subject">ability testing</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060405.154157</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An examination of the effects of gender, age, and computer use on the process and products of misical composition in primary school children</field><field name="creator">Livermore, Joan</field><field name="description">The purpose of this study was to build upon recent research dealing
with the ways children of primary school age operate when
composing original music. Through examining the musical and
structural content of the musical products, and linking these
features to working procedures in the composition process, the
aim was to explore the interaction between process and product,
and to identify any effects attributable to gender, age, or computer
use.
Control of the circumstances in which the compositions were
generated made possible the examination of the activity of the
subjects during the working period, providing data which was
linked to features of the compositional products for possible "cause
and effect".
Compositions were collected from 60 primary school children aged
7, 9 and 11 years. Half of the students in each age-group used the
computer to help them work out their music. There was equal
gender representation in each subgroup.
The working session of ten minutes for each child was recorded,
and later analysed, to discover the pattern of activities taking place
during the composition process.
A second procedure was then undertaken which involved analysis of
the final versions of the compositions of each subject. The pieces
were evaluated by a panel of six judges who identified levels of
achievement on a range of musical and structural items. The
process and product data were analysed to ascertain the influence
of gender, age and computer use. Any significant interactions
between process variables and product variables were also noted.
The research design proved to be useful and functional in providing
empirical data that allowed detailed statistical analysis. The major
significant results related to the process were:
1. Age was a significant factor in subjects' use of the
compositional activities (i.e. exploration, development and
repetition [implying closure] of musical ideas).
2. Computer-users developed their musical ideas more
quickly during the compositional process than non-computer
users.
3. There were significant 2-way interactions between age
and computer use.
The judges' evaluations of the product generated data that
supported previous research that found a developmental sequence
of stages in musical composition. Age was shown to be a significant
influence in all factors derived from the developmental model. The
significant period was between seven and nine years in all cases.
Although significant differences attributable to gender were not
revealed overall, females were predominant in the high scoring
groups on some product variables.
The influence of the computer emerged most clearly in profiles of
subjects who received high/low scores from all judges in each of
the main product variables. In the high scoring groups, computer
users outnumbered non-computer users in every case.
Little is known of the effects of the use of the computer by young
children for composition. Further research is indicated in order to

pathogen causing mild to severe respiratory tract infections. At present, no vaccine is
available for prevention of infection caused by this pathogen. Several outer membrane
proteins (OMPs) of NTHi and its lipooligosaccharide have been investigated as possible
vaccine antigens against NTHi infections. Previous investigations in our laboratory
have shown that OMP26 from an NTHi 289 strain was able to significantly enhance
pulmonary clearance of NTHi in a rat model in which animals were immunised via
intestinal Peyer's patches and then boosted intratracheally (Kyd and Cripps, 1998; El-
Adhami et al., 1999). In recent studies, the OMP26, when used as a parenteral
immunogen, was also highly effective at inducing immune responses that led to
significantly enhanced clearance of the chinchilla nasopharynx (Kyd et al., 2003).
These studies indicate significant potential of the OMP26 as a candidate vaccine antigen
and warrant further investigations for development of a vaccine against NTHi.
This thesis focussed on the immunological and structural characterisation of the NTHi
vaccine candidate, OMP26. Peptides of OMP26 were used as tools to localise the
immunologically important regions of the OMP26. Two different E. coli expression
systems, the GST gene fusion and the 6xHis tagged systems, were employed to
construct the OMP26 peptides. It was found in this study that, despite efforts to
optimise the system, the GST-fusion protein system failed to produce consistent results
for the purification and storage of the OMP26 peptides. In contrast, the 6xHis tagged
system exhibited more reliable outcomes in the production of the recombinant OMP26
peptides and the stability of the stored purified peptides. As such, the purified OMP26
peptides from the 6xHis tagged system were chosen to map major regions of
immunological significance for the OMP26 protein.
The regions of the OMP26 which are involved in the induction of the acquired immune
responses have been identified in the present study. Based on the antigen specific
lymphocyte proliferation assay, the dominant T cell epitopes for OMP26 were located
between amino acid residues 95 and 197 (T3+T4 region). These identified T cell
epitopes exhibited the capability of efficient T cell activation, suggesting that the
epitopes within the T3+T4 region potentially had the highest affinity for binding to the
MHC molecules than did any other OMP26 region. Using two different assay systems,
ELISA and BIA, the predominant B cell epitopes of OMP26 were located between
amino acid residues 45 and 145 (T2+T3 region). This region was also found to be
immunodominant across all animal species tested, and with all immunisation regimens
used. Flow cytometry analysis also revealed that these particular epitopes were
expressed on the surface of NTHi cells. By integration of the data obtained from these
current experimental studies and the computational analysis of the OMP26 sequence,
two hypothetical models of the OMP26 were also proposed in this study.
The significant outcomes obtained in this thesis provide a better understanding of the
specificity of the host immune responses to the OMP26 protein These findings provide
great benefit not only for the development of a future NTHi vaccine but for the
development of the peptide-based immunodiagnostic reagents as well. These diagnostic
reagents will be valuable, in particular, for the evaluation of efficacy of an NTHi
vaccine in humans that may include OMP26 or specific conformational structures.
Future studies are still required to further define the minimum epitope length required
for the B and T cell responses identified in this study. The significance of these
responses in immune protection against NTHi infection also requires further
investigations. Human immune responses also need to be determined, but this can only
be achieved following clinical trial studies.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">immunology</field><field name="subject">nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae</field><field name="subject">influenza vaccines</field><field name="subject">OMP26</field><field name="subject">NTHi</field><field name="subject">respiratory tract infections</field><field name="subject">pathogens</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060406.101830</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The extent to which registered nurses in the ACT state that they use physical assessment skills as a basis for nursing practice</field><field name="creator">James, Jennifer Ann</field><field name="description">The purpose of this research was to discover the extent
to which practising registered nurses in the ACT
undertake physical assessment. It was also organized to
discover the perceived reasons why, in appropriate
instances, it was not undertaken and the extent to which
certain variables may have influenced its practice or
non-practice. It was directed also at discovering the
extent to which the practising registered nurse would be
prepared to undertake workshops on the subject, so that,
if appropriate, a core of registered nurses could be
provided to act as the role-models and to create the
necessary learning environment in the ACT hospitals and
agencies where most of the Canberra College's graduates
would find employment.
Since the first undergraduate course in nursing was
introduced in the tertiary sector, nurse academics have
placed significant emphasis on the teaching of the
nursing process. It is within the first phase of this
process, the assessment phase, that the physical
assessment of the patient/client is conducted.
Discussions with practising registered nurses and
observations, led to some uncertainty as to the extent
to which physical assessment was actually being used. A
review of the literature showed that no investigation of
the matter had been reported in the Australian
literature. It was, therefore, proposed to make good
this deficiency and to resolve any uncertainty about the
extent of use of physical assessment in the ACT.
This study was restricted to registered nurses in the
ACT where all beginning nurses are educated at the CCAE
with a curriculum which includes a comprehensive study
of physical assessment. Even so, it is recognized that
such studies will only reach a beginning level of
competency. In order to ensure that the graduates of
these courses extend their competency in physical
assessment they need to be able to use these skills in
every day nursing practice.
This research, therefore, was conducted using a
questionnaire which incorporated questions about the use
of 36 physical assessment skills. The survey, on a onetime
participation basis, was conducted for all
registered nurses rostered on a fortnightly period in
April 1987. A 66.7% response rate was achieved.
The responses were analyzed and the findings, results
and recommendations are included in the appropriate

unique characteristics in that listeners can participate at all levels. Community radio varies
considerably in its definitions as well as serving several purposes depending on its role in the
nation's media system. However, its fundamental philosophy is similar in that radio is used to
serve the needs and the interests of the community. Access and participation in small-scale
media may not only empower the voiceless, but also maintain local identity and cultures. The
reformation of the Thai broadcasting media system by Section 40 of the 1997 constitution
and the 2000 Broadcasting Act has increased the chance for some communities to use radio
to fulfill their community development needs. The aims of this thesis are: to explore Thai
community radio in the broader context of community radio internationally; to examine Thai
broadcasting policies on community radio; to explore the development of Thai community
radio in relation to the wider liberalisation of the media between 1998 and 2002; and to
analyse similarities and differences in station management, programming and audience
reception in the four different models of community radio that developed in a range of
different provincial Thai community radio stations. A comparative case study using
qualitative research methods was used to examine the four case studies, namely at Petchaburi
(PRD, 1998) Nakhon Si Thammarat (MCOT, 1998), Roi Et (INN, 2000), and Kanchanaburi
(people's radio, 200 I).
The contribution of this thesis lies in its exploration of different models of Thai community
radio so as to illustrate different interpretations by several stakeholders of community radio
discourse, as well as reflecting the constraints on community broadcasting caused by the
political economy of the broadcasting system and regulatory inconsistencies. It concludes that
community radio has not yet contributed to a more empowered media because of several
constraints. Thai community radio did not pursue real participatory communication to
empower its listeners. It merely widened the public space for local communities to have more
choices for information community-based programs with phone-in formats that provided twoway
communication. Thai community radio has not created a wider liberalisation of the
media, however, its development facilitated media democratisation through promoting the
media reform process, and increasing the awareness of citizens' rights among ordinary
people. Station manager and middle-class activists played important roles in putting forth
local issues for public discussion. Increasing numbers of local people became alert to their
rights to communicate as promised by the 1997 constitution, but unfortunately media reform
lacked government support. The Thaksin government had an ambivalent attitude and
contradictory policies towards community radio.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">community radio</field><field name="subject">Thailand</field><field name="subject">media</field><field name="subject">broadcasting policies</field><field name="subject">Petchaburi</field><field name="subject">Nakhon Si Thammarat</field><field name="subject">Roi Et</field><field name="subject">Kanchanaburi</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060410.114156</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The internet experiences of women living in rural and regional Australia</field><field name="creator">Andrew, Monica</field><field name="description">This study explores the internet experiences of women living in rural and regional
Australia, their motives for internet uptake and use, the benefits they gain from using the
internet, the difficulties they encounter in using the internet and whether the benefits are
affected by technical factors, such as computer equipment and telecommunication
infrastructure, availability of opportunities for developing online skills, and perceptions
of the internet. Data was collected via an email snowball technique to contact women
living in rural and regional Australia, resulting in participation by 40 women from
throughout rural and regional areas.
The research drew on the literature of internet research and media uses-and-gratifications.
Although the internet is a relatively new communication technology, it has attracted a
large amount of scholarly interest. However, there has been little research into internet
use by individual populations. Women living in rural and regional areas of Australia
experience geographical and social isolation, with limited access to goods, services and
information, and could be expected, therefore, to gain significant benefits from use of the
internet. However, the potential benefits of the internet could be offset by difficulties
with internet use in rural and regional areas. A narrative approach was used to determine
the motives for internet use by women living in rural and regional Australia, the benefits
they gain from using the internet, the difficulties they encounter in using it and whether
the difficulties affect the benefits they gain from internet use.
The research findings show that, more than anything else, women living in rural and
regional Australia use the internet to build and maintain relationships, including keeping
in touch with family and friends, re-connecting with friends for the past and making new
friends online. They also use the internet to facilitate involvement in community
organisations, to contribute to social issues at the national, state and local level and to
participate in community projects and events. In addition, women living in rural and
regional Australia use the internet to undertake business and education related activities,
pursue personal interests, seek emotional support and undertake practical tasks, such as
finding and disseminating information, banking and shopping. However, the many
benefits of the internet are offset to some extent by the many frustrations encountered in
using it, particularly in regard to technical factors and developing online skills. Spam
mail and viruses also cause considerable inconvenience.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">rural women</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">internet users</field><field name="subject">computers and women</field><field name="subject">regional Australia</field><field name="subject">online computer skills</field><field name="subject">internet research</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060410.122445</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Young, sexually active, senior high school women in the australian Capital Territory: prevalence and risk factors for genital Human papillomavirus infection</field><field name="creator">O'Keefe, Elissa J.</field><field name="description">An association between persistent Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection in women
and cervical cancer has been established. Young women are particularly at risk of
acquiring sexually transmitted infections such as HPV because of risky sexual activity
and physiological immaturity. While at risk though, young women have been shown
to be amenable to health promoting initiatives. There are a small number of
international studies concerning adolescent HPV infection and the risk factors
associated with infection, but there is currently no evidence on the prevalence and risk
factors for HPV in an Australian, sexually active female adolescent population. This
study aimed to provide evidence of the prevalence of HPV, risk factors associated
with infection and the patterns of sexual activity in a female sexually active, senior
high school population in the Australian Capital Territory.
Participants in this study were a convenience sample of 161 sexually active 16-19
year old females who had an HPV test who were attending a senior high school in the
Australian Capital Territory. Nurses and doctors using a clinical record collected
information about sexual and other risk behaviours. Self-obtained vaginal swabs were
tested for HPV DNA using the polymerase chain reaction method and genotyping was
undertaken.
The HPV prevalence in this cohort of young women was 1 1.2%. High-risk genotypes
were found in 55.5% and multiple genotypes were found in 38.8%. There was a
significant association found between HPV infection and having had more than one
male partner with whom vaginal intercourse had occurred in the previous six months.
No statistically significant association was found between HPV and the age of
coitarche, length of time young women had been sexually active, condom use, and
smoking or alcohol intake. A young age at coitarche was common for this group.
Smoking and alcohol use was seen in large proportions in this group.
This is the first Australian study that has examined the prevalence and risk factors for
genital HPV in this demographic group. The HPV prevalence is lower than in
international studies in comparable groups, in similar age groups and much lower than
in older women both in Australia and overseas. With the comparatively low
prevalence comes an opportunity for important public health interventions for this
group including routine Pap smears, vaccination against the high-risk types of HPV
when this becomes available and strategies for young women to reduce their number
of male sexual partners. A substantial amount of young women in this study were
sexually active aged under 16 years. Whilst this was not identified as being a risk
factor in this study, it is both a health and personal safety issue for these young
women. There is a demonstrated need for health promotion strategies for this cohort
about the consumption of safe levels of alcohol and for smoking cessation. Further
research is recommended that includes a repetition of this study with a larger sample,
the use of a prospective study design to identify trends in infection and examination of
HPV prevalence and risk factors for a variety of populations.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Human papillomavirus infection</field><field name="subject">HPV</field><field name="subject">Australian Capital Territory</field><field name="subject">ACT</field><field name="subject">sexual activity</field><field name="subject">high school students</field><field name="subject">papillomavirus diseases</field><field name="subject">genital diseases</field><field name="subject">women</field><field name="subject">females</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060410.140559</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Australian reviewers of children's books: an empirical report</field><field name="creator">Milne, Patricia A.</field><field name="description">This thesis reports on a study which developed a profile of the reviewers of
children's books in Australia. It then compared the profile with one which was
developed by Kathleen Craver in 1984 of children's book reviewers in the United
States.
Five research questions were addressed by this study relating to reviewers and their
opinions regarding review aspects, reviewer roles and review practices within the
framework of their personal and professional background. Craver surveyed the
reviewers from School Library journal because as a group, they provided the
greatest potential for statistical significance of all the reviewing journals in the
United States. As no Australian journal enjoys either the number of reviewers or
the circulation of School Library journal, reviewers from eight journals which are
most used by teacher and children's librarians were selected to form the population
for this research. These journals are Fiction Focus, LINES, Magpies, Reading Time,
Reviewpoin t, Review Bulletin, Scan and Tasmanian Resources Review.
The reviewer profile which emerged from this study was very similar to Craver's in
that it was not one which could be entirely defined in terms of group characteristics.
Selected cross tabulations either with the particular journals, demographic details,
or other variables, particularly those relating to reviewer experience failed to
produce predictable behaviourial correlations. However, reviewers were united on
certain issues which can be attributed to their own professional background.</field><field name="date">1990</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">book reviewing</field><field name="subject">children's literature</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">children's books</field><field name="subject">Kathleen Craver</field><field name="subject">Fiction Focus</field><field name="subject">LINES</field><field name="subject">Magpies</field><field name="subject">Reading Time</field><field name="subject">Reviewpoint</field><field name="subject">Review Bulletin</field><field name="subject">Scan</field><field name="subject">Tasmanian Resources Review</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060410.150051</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Factors leading to the non-completion of units at an A.C.T. secondary college</field><field name="creator">Newman, W.S.</field><field name="description">This study looks at factors relating to the noncompletion
of units of study by students in a secondary
college. It is aimed at providing information for
decision-makers at Erindale College specifically in the
area of course counselling. Administrators and counsellors
at other colleges should also find the information of
value.
The study compared a sample of students who completed
all their chosen units of study in one semester with all
students who did not complete all of their chosen units in
that semester. The latter group consisted of those who
withdrew from one or more units during the semester, those
who left the college and those who were deemed
"unassessable" as a result of poor attendance or nonsubmission
of assessment items.
All 362 students in the college were asked to complete
a Baseline Questionnaire during Week 3 of Semester 1,
1985. This sought background information about reasons for
enrolling at college, influences on their choice of units,
future intentions, preferred ways of learning and other
details. Students who withdrew from, or changed units
during the semester were asked to complete a Change of
Unit Survey and any leavers were asked to complete a
Leaver's Survey.
In Week 16 (May, 1985) all students still enrolled
were asked to complete an End of Semester Questionnaire
designed to enable comparisons of attitudes between those
who completed all units and those who did not.
The study looks at a number of characteristics of
students and their attitudes to various aspects of
learning, college life and choice of units of study. It
attempts to look at factors that might affect the
student's decision to complete or not complete a chosen
unit of study. The factors considered were largely based
upon studies of early school leavers.
FINDINGS.
1. Students who do not complete units tend to have one
or more of the following characteristics (significant at
the 0.05 level):
(a) do not enrol to gain tertiary entrance
qualifications
(b) enrol to improve their chances of getting a job
(c) are not definitely seeking a tertiary entrance
score
(d) have no definite intention of completing Year 12
(e) have no firm intention of studying subjects in
order to complete major or minor courses in them
(f) are less likely to have a part-time job
(g) by the end of the semester, are not happy with
their marks in most units
(h) finish the semester studying less than 3 T-units
(i) continue into Semester 2 with 3 or more A-units
and less than 3 T-units
(j) do not consider their parents' wishes an important
influence on the choice of units for Semester 2.
In addition to these, one other finding of interest,
with a significance of 0.055 (approx.), showed that noncompleters tend to come from a socio-economic background
of parents who are either managers/employers/self-employed
or manual-skilled workers (i.e. not professional or nonmanual/clerical).
2. No significant differences at the 0.05 level were
found between males and females nor between Year 11 and
Year 12 students in their tendency to complete units.
3. Students who change or withdraw from units give the
following reasons (in rank order of frequency):
- they are  getting poor marks
- they are unable to understand the work
- they find the class activities uninteresting
- they state that the content is not very relevant to
their needs
- the unit is not suited to their career plans.
IMPLICATIONS.
The implications for administrators at Erindale
College are:
1. Students should be encouraged to formulate specific
goals and develop a commitment to their education.
2. Students who are "at risk" need to be identified
early and given tutorial assistance in units where
they are having difficulty with understanding.
3. The curriculum must be kept under review in order
to provide for the needs of all students.</field><field name="date">1987</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">education</field><field name="subject">Australian Capital Territory</field><field name="subject">ACT</field><field name="subject">Erindale College</field><field name="subject">secondary school students</field><field name="subject">high school students</field><field name="subject">student attitudes</field><field name="subject">units of study</field><field name="subject">withdrawal (education)</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060411.115702</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A re-examination of corporate governance: concepts, models, theories and future directions</field><field name="creator">Ziolkowski, Richard</field><field name="description">This thesis represents a scholarly journey towards an understanding of
corporate governance. Unlike the vast majority of writings on governance, this
work attempts to take a step back, and to consider why and how we should
study corporate governance. These critical questions have been largely
ignored during the frenzy of governance research in the past few decades.
The thesis argues that corporate governance theory and practice reflects a
Tower of Academic Babel&#185; reality as writers from diverse backgrounds use
different approaches, invent terminology and proclaim a new 'theory'. The
thesis analyses the extent of this conceptual confusion about corporate
governance and why this arises. It also considers some possible reasons for
the increasing disillusionment with the legal, ethical, cultural, institutional,
regulatory and other contexts of corporate governance.
The corporate governance literature indicates that much uncertainty has
arisen over the nature of corporate governance. Both, denotative and
connotative meanings of corporate governance have been ambiguous, often
because of poorly defined concepts. This ambiguity is compounded by
confusion over methodological concepts such as "paradigm", "system",
"model" and "theory", the key constructs employed by many legal, and other,
writers. Moreover, much of the literature on corporate governance is founded
on ethnocentric concepts that are often "chauvinistic in the extreme".&#178; This
confusion has been intensified by the added complexity of unique
phenomenology, demonstrated by numerous writers with "scholarship and
advocacy that is culturally and economically insensitive"&#179;
This thesis argues that the search for corporate efficiency and effectiveness
is often misguided, both because of biased performance criteria and a lack of
a clear conceptual domain. Consequently, the corporate governance
discourse fails meaningfully to address the enigma of what is the range of
corporate governance influence on corporate activities? The overarching
argument made in this thesis is that our understanding of corporate
governance requires a clarification of methodological approach and a
comparative perspective.
By recasting corporate governance research within consistent models,
theories and applications this thesis lays the foundation for future research by
which we may investigate the causal relationships that determine corporate
efficiency, effectiveness and the optimum structures for good corporate
governance.

fiction in which satire and its related subversive forms are largely overlooked. It
consequently reads five of White's post-1948 novels from the standpoint of satire.
It discusses the history and various theories of satire to develop an analytic
framework appropriate to his satire and it conducts a comprehensive review of the
critical literature to account for the development of the dominant orthodox
religious approach to his fiction. It compares aspects of White's satire to aspects
of the satire produced by some of the notable exemplars of the English and
American traditions and it takes issue with a number of the readings produced by
the religious and other established approaches to White's fiction.
I initially establish White as a satirist by elaborating the social satire that
emerges incidentally in The Tree of Man and rather more episodically in Voss. I
investigate White's sources for Voss to shed light on the extent of his engagement
with history, on his commitment to historical accuracy, and on the extent to which
this is a serious high-minded historical work in which he seeks to teach us more
about our selves, particularly about our history and identity. The way White
expands his satire in Voss given that it is an eminently historical novel is
instructive in terms of his purposes. I illustrate White's burgeoning use of satire
by elaborating the extended and sometimes extravagant satire that he develops in
Riders in the Chariot, by investigating the turn inwards upon his own creative
activity that occurs when he experiments with a variant subversive form, satire by
parody, in The Eye of the Storm, and by examining his use of the devices, tropes,
and strategies of post-modem grotesque satire in The Twyborn Affair.
My reading of White's novels from the standpoint of satire enables me to
identify an important development within his oeuvre that involves a shift away
from the symbolic realism of The Aunt's Story (1948) and the two novels that
precede it to a mode of writing that is initially historical in The Tree of Man and
Voss but which becomes increasingly satirical as White expands his satire and
experiments with such related forms as burlesque, parody, parodic satire, and
grotesque satire in his subsequent novels. I thus chart a change in the nature of
his satire that reflects a dramatic movement away from the ontological concerns
of modernism to the epistemological concerns of post-modernism. Consequent
upon this, I pinpoint the changes in the philosophy that his satire bears as its
ultimate meaning.
I examine the links between the five novels and White's own period to
establish the socio-historical referentiality of his satire. I argue that because his
engagement with Australian history, society, and culture, is ongoing and
thorough, then these five novels together comprise a subjective history of the
period, serving to complement our knowledge in these areas. This study
demonstrates that White's writing, because of the ongoing development of his
satire, is never static but ever-changing. He is not simply or exclusively a
religious or otherwise metaphysical novelist, or a symbolist-allegorist, or a
psychological realist, or any other kind of generic writer. Finally, I demonstrate
that White exceeds the categories that his critics have tried to impose upon him.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">The Tree of Man</field><field name="subject">Voss</field><field name="subject">Riders in the Chariot</field><field name="subject">The Eye of the Storm</field><field name="subject">The Twyborn Affair</field><field name="subject">Patrick White</field><field name="subject">Australian novelists</field><field name="subject">satire</field><field name="subject">parody</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060418.131055</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Visitor management in action: an analysis of the development and implementation of visitor management models at Jenolan Caves and Kangaroo Island</field><field name="creator">McArthur, Simon</field><field name="description">Many of the places that people value are the places they wish to visit and experience for
themselves. However, each person that visits one of these places can cause impacts that
reduce its value. A fimdamental aim of visitor management therefore is to ensure that each
visitor's experience is a high quality one, and is sustainable. Various models have been
designed to assist with this aim by linking visitor management planning, monitoring and
decision making. However, there is a lack of published examples of how visitor management
models have been implemented, what results they have yielded, and how well they have
performed. There is also a lack of evidence of widespread application of such models.
Without information and insight, there is only a theoretical case to argue for the greater use
of visitor management models.
The aim of this study was therefore to describe, analyse and explain the formulation and
implementation of the most widely published visitor management models, with reference to
case studies of Jenolan Caves (New South Wales) and Kangaroo Island (South Australia).
The study involved: a literature review; personal observations by the author; in-depth
interviews with those involved in developing and implementing the two case studies; and an
objective analysis using a Goals Achievement Matrix.
The thesis critically examined seven visitor management models with respect to their:
evolution and definition; dimensions and planning and development approaches; documented
applications in Australia and overseas; and limitations. This would appear to be the first time
that these models have been critically examined in this way so that comparisons can be easily
made between them. This would also appear to be the most comprehensive identification of
examples of implemented visitor management models in Australia.
The study identified five critical issues relating to development and implementation of visitor
management models:
1. Poor planning hmeworks and poorly defined organisational culture, particularly in
visitor and tourism management.  2. Lack of, or inconsistent human and financial resources.
3. Resistance to involving stakeholders in fimdamental decision-making.
4. Difficulty in choosing the right model for the situation.
5. Lack of strategic emphasis and technical ability.
The study suggested that more effort needed to be made in the pre-development and
implementation phases. Critical to such efforts is the development of an implementation plan,
written as part of the development process. The implementation plan requires an
individual(s) to take on a strategic coordination role that addresses marketing, staff
development, budgeting, evaluation and areas for improvement. The study suggested that the
conventional emphasis on technical expertise needs to be re-balanced with political skills to
lobby for and protect the human and financial resources needed to implement a model long
enough for it to prove its value. In the event where resourcing is too limited to fully
operationalise an entire model at once, it was recommended to conservatively develop a
portion of the chosen model all the way to the stage in which it delivers results that can be
marketed to stakeholders.
Finally, the study proposed a tool to assist visitor managers to clarify their need for a model,
as well as their capability to develop and implement one. In the absence of sufficient
information about the implementation of models, the tool empowers managers to consider the -
merits of using a visitor management model further, and to select a model that best meets
their needs.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Jenolan Caves</field><field name="subject">Kangaroo Island</field><field name="subject">visitor management</field><field name="subject">tourism management</field><field name="subject">recreation areas</field><field name="subject">Goals Achievement Matrix</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060424.160716</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Strategic planning in Commonwealth departments: beyond magaerialism: from bounded rationality to bounded uncertainty</field><field name="creator">Wills, Jules A.</field><field name="description">n/a</field><field name="date">1991</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">strategic planning</field><field name="subject">Australian Commonwealth departmnents</field><field name="subject">public management</field><field name="subject">Australian Public Service</field><field name="subject">APS</field><field name="subject">corporate sector planning</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060426.154713</field></doc><doc><field name="title">'an unsettled state': the real and the imainary in Australian cinematic and designed landscapes</field><field name="creator">Boden, Susan</field><field name="description">This thesis considers varied representations of landscape in
Australian narrative film and designed landscape. Landscape is
taken as an active concept that combines the associative meanings
of place and the dynamism of space. Sixteen film and designed
landscapes are examined to derive their landscape sources, forms

these landscapes is considered under a specific theme: landscape as
delight, absence, nation or hope.
In addition to detailing specific landscape responses by the
designers of the examined landscapes, this project aims to
contribute to an enhanced conversation about the effective, just
practice of landscape architecture.
The topic derives from a question central to landscape architectural
practice in a post-colonial context, such as Australia. In a cultural
setting where no single, agreed definition of landscape is allowed
by the conditions of its history, which versions do practitioners of
landscape architecture take up? What should be their limits, where
are their inspirations and whose landscape narratives are ignored in

information-seeking behaviour of 143 general practitioners in their delivery
of patient care to the elderly on the Gold Coast.
The study sought to obtain an information profile in order to begin
discussion on the need for possible infrastructures that may need to be
considered in any planning strategies concerned with access to and
provision of relevant, accurate and timely information to general
practitioners which affects their delivery of patient care to the growing
number of elderly patients.
A ten-page questionnaire utilising both structured and unstructured
questions was returned by 61.9 percent of the survey population.
Demographic characteristics indicated that respondents were representative
of general practitioners in Australia.
Respondents frequently needed information with 40 percent requiring it '1 -
4 times a week' and 78 percent 'once a month or more often'. Information
on medical fact was required most frequently, 29 percent, medical opinion
27 percent, and non-medical information 23 percent.
The study found support for the proposition that computerised information
systems need to be enhanced and made widely known and available to
general practitioners to assist them in obtaining information that they need
in delivery of patient care to the elderly. There is a great need by these
general practitioners for non-medical information as well as medical
information. Therefore, the development of a database of non-medical
information containing information on local agencies and services is of high
priority.
Library information delivery services should also be de-institutionalised in
terms of lifting restrictions to services provided to enable general
practitioners greater access to information. Library services should aim to
provide remote access to information via telephone, fax and modem with
emphasis on value added services aimed at solving a particular specific
information need as well as straight-out bibliographic search services and
document delivery services.
Continuing medical education in the form of CME courses, conferences and
meetings should focus on specific information needs of general practitioners
in this area of patient care to the elderly. The need for information on
cardiology, orthopaedics, dermatology, physiotherapy, podiatry,
pharmaceutical benefits, home help, Meals-on-Wheels and nursing home
placement were areas of particular interest identified by respondents in this
study.</field><field name="date">1994</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">elderly</field><field name="subject">Gold Coast</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Queensland</field><field name="subject">general practitioners</field><field name="subject">GPs</field><field name="subject">medical care</field><field name="subject">medicine</field><field name="subject">general practice</field><field name="subject">information services</field><field name="subject">patient care</field><field name="subject">continuing medical education</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060426.164122</field></doc><doc><field name="title">"Principal, he's the boss": power, culture and schooling on Saibai in the Torres Strait Islands</field><field name="creator">Davis, Jenny</field><field name="description">This thesis examines issues of power, culture and schooling as they apply
to an indigenous community located on Saibai Island in the Torres Strait
of northern Australia. The thesis combines literature research with
ethnography to consider Saibaian schooling in various contexts. These
include the history of schooling in the region, the relevant educational
literature and the actual physical and social contexts of schooling on
Saibai. Early chapters deal with methodology, history and educational
literature. Later chapters deal with ethnographic material using the
themes of separation, culture and collaborative decision-making to
organise the data. The work of Michel Foucault informs the analytical
approach to issues of power. Hence power is considered to be ubiquitous,
productive and linked to issues of knowledge and culture. School
principals are identified as key figures in schooling and therefore play a
major role in the thesis. As the principals are all men of non-Islander
(anglo) backgrounds, this thesis represents a significant break from works
within the realm of indigenous education that are heavily influenced by
cultural anthropology and tend to focus only on the Aboriginal or Islander
participants as objects of study.
The thesis considers how Saibaian people are excluded from schooling
through various techniques and practices that tend to place the principal in
a position of autocracy vis a vis the school. Furthermore, I show how
various schooling practices that aim to include community members in
schooling are shaped and transformed such that they actually serve to
entrench the principal in his position of control over schooling. This
applies even in the way that cultural activities are incorporated into the
school illustrating that no aspect of schooling is immune to relations of
power. Indeed, the notion of Saibaian Islanders belonging to a unique
cultural group is used by some principals to argue that they are unsuited to
roles within the school's decision-making process. Ultimately, then, this
thesis is about relations between school principals and community
members in the context of schooling on Saibai Island.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Saibai Island</field><field name="subject">Torres Strait Islands</field><field name="subject">education</field><field name="subject">history</field><field name="subject">schooling</field><field name="subject">indigenous education</field><field name="subject">indigenous communities</field><field name="subject">power</field><field name="subject">culture</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060427.084424</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A critical examination of Australian constitutional law relating to territories and to places acquired by the Commonwealth (including a comparison with United States Law)</field><field name="creator">Hopper, Alvin W. L.</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the constitutional position in relation to those geographical areas over
which the Commonwealth has sole power. These are the Territories, and Commonwealth
places (over which, however, the States may retain some vestigial power). The thesis seeks to
give a comprehensive account of the constitutional law concerning these heads of power.
The thesis traces the tortuous history of the case law on the Territories, with its many
instances of inconsistent decisions and dicta. In the words of a High Court Judge, Sir Douglas
Menzies, the cases have "not resulted in a coherent body of doctrine". The problems have
been particularly acute in regard to the exercise of judicial power, and they are compounded
by the silence of the Constitution on some major issues concerning the Territories, such as the
relationship between the 'Territories' power and the Constitution as a whole.
The thesis' main contention is that, contrary to predominant doctrine, the constitutional
position of the Territories and of Commonwealth places is federal, not 'disparate'. In this
connection, several tenets are advanced: first, that the Constitution must be interpreted as a
whole&#65533;that is, as a single instrument; secondly, that the Territories are an integral part of
Australia, and their inhabitants, while not enjoying all the constitutional benefits of State
residents, are full members of the Australian community; and thirdly, that there is no
constitutional distinction to be drawn between different classes of Territory&#65533;thus, despite
some contrary suggestions, there is no distinction between 'internal' and 'external' Territories
or between Territories acquired from the States and Territories otherwise acquired.
The thesis explores the particular difficulties, notably in the judicial sphere, that arise from
the relevant case law, and it critically examines the cases against the text of the Constitution,
as well as against the yardstick of those tenets. With regard to the Territories, the thesis
analyses the constitutional topics of executive power and self-government. It considers
particular issues concerning each of the three self-governing Territories, including the special
status of the Australian Capital Territory as the federal "seat of government".
In addition, the thesis looks at the constitutional position in the United States concerning
Territories, federal enclaves and the American seat of government (the District of Columbia).
The thesis draws a comparison between the American position and the corresponding position
in Australia, and it critically considers the judicial interpretation, in both countries, of the
constitutional grant to the federal legislature of exclusive, or sole, power over such
geographical areas. This process assists an evaluation of the Australian position.
The thesis concludes that, in some respects, the Australian case law has gone seriously astray,
especially in treating the 'Territories' power as more or less separate from the rest of the
Constitution. This judicial approach has led to a convoluted and confusing situation. Despite a
degree of amelioration as a result of some more recent cases, the corrective process is by no
means complete. The courts are hampered in their development of a "coherent body of
doctrine" by the random way in which cases come before them, and it is unlikely that the
position can be fully retrieved solely by judicial decisions. The thesis therefore proposes
various reforms, and it sets out, in an appendix, proposed amendments of the Constitution.
In addition to expounding and criticising the case law on the constitutional topics under
discussion, the thesis reviews and, where appropriate, cites from the relevant legal literature.
The thesis considers the Australian case law as decided down to the end of 2004.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">constitutional law</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">United States</field><field name="subject">territories</field><field name="subject">self government</field><field name="subject">case law</field><field name="subject">Australian Capital Territory</field><field name="subject">ACT</field><field name="subject">District of Columbia</field><field name="subject">Washington DC</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060427.091040</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Facilitated communication and people with brain injury: three case studies</field><field name="creator">Joslyn, Noella</field><field name="description">This study examines facilitated communication as it was experienced by three people who
were affected by acquired brain injury.
Facilitated communication is a type of augmentative communication purported to allow
persons with a severe communication impairments to communicate. The assumption is
made that people with global apraxia can communicate if given physical support. The
technique usually involves a facilitator providing physical support to the arm, hand or
elbow of the person with the severe communication impairment to assist them to point to
objects, pictures, printed letters and words or to a keyboard. Facilitated communication is
a controversial method because it is difficult to establish the existence, or extent of the
facilitator's influence in the communication of the person with a disability.
Although much of the research on facilitated communication has been conducted with
people with intellectual or developmental disabilities, research on the use of the technique
with people with brain injury offers several advantages. Firstly, most people with brain
injury were known to be competent communicators prior to the brain injury. Secondly,
many recover sufficiently to allow a retrospective examination of the issues that faced
them when they were using the technique. Thirdly, there can be a large amount of data
available about the person's diagnosis, their prognosis and the course of their history
following the event. Consequently, the current study uses a case study methodology to
explore the application of facilitated communication with people with brain injury and
draws on personal recollections of people with brain injury, interviews with families and
medical and therapist reports.
The three people interviewed in the study displayed varying language and memory abilities.
They indicated a preference for independent communication techniques and they reported
frustrations with using facilitated communication. They quickly rejected the method when
speech began to appear even though their speech was inadequate for communication
purposes, for two of them, for an extended period. One of the interviewees reported that
facilitator influence was overwhelming at times but not always present. Two of the
interviewees felt that facilitated communication gave them a start in their recovery
process. Two of the interviewees reported that meaningful exchanges with others occurred
only with speech.
In addition to these findings the study, although not experimental, was able to shed light
on some of the contentious issues surrounding facilitated communication. The method is
reported to be designed to overcome the motor difficulties of the disabled communicator
by providing physical assistance to individuals with poor fine motor control thus breaking
the perseveration cycle that can be present . However the task of coping with facilitator
influence may actually require some motor skills. Also, the physical effort involved in using
facilitated communication for some individuals may have been underestimated by its
supporters. However the study has shown that some individuals with severe
communication impairments felt that facilitated communication had some merit but saw
their ability to communicate independently as the significant achievement in their recovery.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">brain injury</field><field name="subject">facilitated communication</field><field name="subject">global apraxia</field><field name="subject">case studies</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060427.093347</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An exploration of groupware as an enabling technology for the learning organisation</field><field name="creator">Pitt, Christine Ann</field><field name="description">The Australian business environment has been changing at an ever-increasing pace
since the mid-1980s. Technological, economic and social changes have altered the
working environment. There have been constant technological advances with
information technology influencing most categories of work. Organisations in public
and private sectors have ongoing expectations of increased productivity, increased
quality of processes and swifter responsiveness to clients. Team roles have changed.
Team members are multi-skilled and work is designed to emphasise the whole task.
The Karpin Industry Task Force described a vision for an Australian business
environment that would, by 2014, be one with a flexible, skilled and motivated
workforce, world class managers, a customer comes first mentality, and an
internationally competitive perspective. These characteristics are congruent with
those of learning organisations.
The aim of this study is to evaluate the suitability of groupware as the supporting
infrastructure for a learning organisation. To do this, the study assesses the use of
technology to support personal and team learning in a learning organisation, studies
the impact of groupware on learning within workgroups, determines the extent to
which communication and learning styles influence its effectiveness, and identifies
ways in which groupware can be used to capture the information used to support
knowledge management in an organisation. Two case studies are used to undertake
this assessment.
Three distinct yet related frameworks underpin this study. The first is that of
Groupware and the related research frameworks of Computer Supported Cooperative
Work (CSCW) and Computer Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL). The
second is the Learning Organisation and its supporting disciplines. The final
framework is that of learning and the action-oriented learning processes. Each is
examined and the interrelatedness of the frameworks is explored.

flourished in media and populist discourse, within education systems and in government
inquiries in both Australia and the rest of the Western world. Whilst this discourse commonly
assumes that more male primary teachers will benefit both boys in schools and society in
general, other important considerations are silenced and overlooked and attention is seldom
paid to the experience of male primary school teachers.
This study explores the experience of male primary school teachers and the prevailing societal
discourses about them. It focuses on their experience of crossing over into a career that is
commonly regarded by society as 'women's work', and charts the advantages and
disadvantages they face as a result of their maleness. The understandings that are found
within this study are informed by relevant literature and by data emanating from media
discourse analysis, statistical analysis and life history interviews.
As a result of examining the relevant literature and data, this study has found that the
experience of male primary teachers is likely to be complex, contradictory and problematic.
Whilst some of their experiences are similar to those of female primary teachers, this study
only focuses on the part of their experience that differs from female teachers and is the direct
result of their maleness. Their choice to cross-over into women's work such as primary
teaching appears to yield a unique and complex mixture of experiences that are poorly
understood by both themselves and others. In particular, it is apparent that they experience a
vexing combination of advantages and disadvantages as a result of being a male in women's
work. This study has identified eight categories of disadvantage and four categories of
advantage that the males experience. The various sources of literature and data have differing
constructions as to whether the males are advantaged and / or disadvantaged. Most
commonly, the sources privilege either the disadvantages or the advantages and silence the
other. More rarely, they acknowledge and accommodate both. On the whole, the
disadvantages are better articulated, understood and documented than the advantages, which
are often silenced and ignored.
In order to fully explore the experience of male primary teachers, this study has also sought to
identify the prevailing societal discourses and debates about them and to examine whether
they are affecting the experience of the males. Information about societal discourses was
found in the literature, media and life history interviews, with media discourse providing the
most significant and comprehensive data. After examining these prevailing discourses about
male primary teachers, this study has found that they have an enormous impact on the
experience of male primary school teachers. However, in contrast, the study has shown that
the experience of male primary school teachers is not contributing to, informing or shaping
either societal or media discourses. As a result, these discourses can be seen to be largely
inaccurate, unreflective and unproductive because they do not reflect the experience of male
primary teachers.
This examination into the experience of male primary teachers makes an important
contribution to knowledge because there are so few Australian studies of males who cross
over into women's work or on the sexual division of labour in contemporary Australian
society. Whilst the study produces many more questions than it supplies answers, it
nevertheless results in extremely important understandings about the experience of male
primary school teachers and crossing-over into non-traditional work. In particular, the study
reveals the problematic nature of their experience and the complex experiences, advantages
and disadvantages that they face as a result of their maleness. It also charts the unhelpful
ways that prevailing societal debates and discourses about them have been constructed. It
points to the need for new and more sophisticated societal debates and discourses about male
primary teachers that will accommodate the complexity of their experience. It is therefore
anticipated that these findings will make an important contribution to understandings about
the experience of male primary teachers and to the development of more informed societal
discourses about them. Most importantly, the study will provide a language and framework to
enable the issues that have been identified about the experience of male primary teachers to be
adequately addressed within education policy, teaching practice and teacher education
strategies.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">male teachers</field><field name="subject">primary school education</field><field name="subject">teacher's attitudes</field><field name="subject">sex roles</field><field name="subject">workplace</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060427.111729</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Wood, money and habitat to burn: environmental issues and the role of the educator</field><field name="creator">Treweek, Allison</field><field name="description">n/a</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">firewood</field><field name="subject">firewood industry</field><field name="subject">remnant vegetation management</field><field name="subject">Australian Capital Territory</field><field name="subject">ACT</field><field name="subject">wood-burning</field><field name="subject">heating</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060427.114839</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Targeting M-cells for oral vaccine delivery</field><field name="creator">Tyrer, Peter Charles</field><field name="description">An in vitro model of the follicle-associated epithelia that overlie the Peyer's patches of the
small intestine was developed and validated to examine the mechanisms of mucosal antigen
sampling. This model displays many phenotypic and physiological characteristics of M cells
including apical expression of [alpha]5[beta]l integrin and enhanced energy dependent participate
transport. CD4+ T-cells were shown to be an important influence on the development of Mlike
cells.
The model was used to examine the M cell mediated uptake of several putative whole-cell
killed bacterial vaccines. Greater numbers of non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae NTHi
289, NTHi 2019, Escherichia coli 075 HMN and Streptococcus pneumoniae were
transported by model M cells compared to control Caco-2 enterocyte-like cells. Studies in
isolated murine intestine segments confirmed the selective uptake of NTHi 289 and
Escherichia coli demonstrating that intestinal mucosal sampling of these antigens is
performed by M cells. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was not absorbed as whole cell bacteria but
as soluble antigen, as indicated by the presence of bacterial DNA in the cytoplasm of
epithelial cells. These results suggest that bacteria such as NTHi and E. coli are sampled by
the mucosal immune system in a different manner to that of bacteria such as Pseudomonas.
A number of potential cell surface receptors were investigated to identify which molecules
are responsible for intestinal uptake whole-cell killed bacteria. Immunofluorescence studies
detected the presence of toll-like receptor-2, toll-like receptor-4, PAF-R and [alpha]5[beta]l integrin
on in vitro M-like cell cultures. Examinations of murine intestine confirmed the presence of
TLR-4 and PAF-R. TLR-4 was found in small quantities and on M cells. In contrast to the M
cell model, TLR-2 expression in the murine intestine was sparse.
Receptor inhibition experiments provided evidence for the involvement of TLR-4, PAF-R
and [alpha]5[beta]l integrin in M cell uptake of killed bacteria both in vitro and in vivo.
This thesis has contributed valuable information regarding the mechanisms of uptake of
whole-cell killed bacteria by the intestinal mucosal immune system. For the first time, M cell
sampling of whole-cell killed bacteria has been demonstrated. Furthermore, the receptors
involved in these processes have been identified. This information will be of great use in the

The thesis argument is that theory can be developed about the
implementation, maintenance and dissemination of school health education
based on a school development approach. Such theory development can
assist teachers to design programs appropriate to the needs of their
classrooms, schools and communities.
Thesis Setting
The implementation and maintenance of school health education programs
has not usually been the focus of research and as a consequence is rarely
reported in the literature. The research in this thesis draws upon many
disciplines and fields but in order to answer the thesis questions
methodological processes were required that were consistent with current
school situations. The earlier School Development in Health Education
(SDHE) program's work in research, development and dissemination provided
the setting for the thesis.
Methodology of the Research
The methodology of the research study involved a case study approach using
both multiple and single case studies. Data have been drawn from SDHE
schools in South Australia undertaking health, sexuality and drug education.
The methodology adopted for the studies in this thesis is a case study design
incorporating an iterative theory-study-theory sequence in which an initial
theory statement derived from the literature guides the development of a
multiple case study which, in effect, 'tests' the theory in a qualitative way. The
finding of the case study then informs development and elaboration of the
theory statement in its second version. This is then used to test the next
multiple case study which leads to further development of the theory in its third
version. The third iteration of the theory is tested in a single case study that
leads to the fourth and final version of the theory.
Data analysis was aided by the use of the Q.S.R. NUD.IST computer package
that helped to manage and explore the thesis ideas about the data. In
establishing these syntheses the chain of evidence in the data sets was
maintained. The analysis also allowed the thesis findings to be used to test
theories about the data that answered the thesis questions.
Thesis Findings
The findings of the thesis are contained in the final version of the theory. The
theory is structured around program drivers, phases, types and processes that
together produce implementation, maintenance and dissemination. This final
theory statement is the basis for drawing the thesis conclusions.
Thesis Conclusions
It was concluded that patterns of factors that enhance and inhibit the
implementation, maintenance and dissemination of school health education
programs could be placed in a theoretical framework that can guide practice in
school health education.
To be successful school health education programs have to include three
critical elements: leadership, action research and funding. Leaders or program
drivers need to be identified and resourced; they may be principals or
designated teaching staff with access to decision making, policy processes
and resource allocation in schools. Teachers need to engage in a reflective
action research process to develop, modify and sustain their curriculum
development work. Programs require adequate funding resources for
teachers' professional development, including action research, and the
purchase of human and material resources. Schools planning to introduce
programs may learn from the experience of others but they must themselves
engage in the critical and essential program features identified in the final
version of the theory.
Implications
The thesis conclusions imply the need to use more efficient ways of bringing
schools' and teachers' hidden competence to the fore to support school health
education program through varied patterns of professional development,
technical support and curriculum development and implementation, and
through funding of enhanced professional practice for health literacy.
A major implication for the health sector is that many health workers need to
learn collaborative skills since there is a tendency to take control and attempt
to direct what teachers should do rather than work with and support them.
An implication for programs in complex social environments is the need for
careful planning in collaboration with other stakeholders. The critical elements
developed in this thesis also apply - leadership, action research and funding.
Evaluation can adopt a case study approach as a more suitable method for
examining what happens in programs than an overly simplistic approach of
assessing goals and objectives which ignores the differences in program
implementation for different sites with the necessary localisation.
Further Research
Further research suggested by the thesis findings are in the areas of school
health education in the changing administrative and management environment
today, and of the use of various types of case study research in tandem to
answer comprehensive and complex program performance questions.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">health education</field><field name="subject">South Australia</field><field name="subject">School Development in Health Education</field><field name="subject">SDHE</field><field name="subject">case studies</field><field name="subject">sex eduxtion</field><field name="subject">drug education</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060427.131945</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Australian experience of modern racism: the nature, expression and measurement of racial prejudice, discrimination and stereotypes</field><field name="creator">Wheeler, Jenny</field><field name="description">This thesis aimed to investigate the changing nature, expression and

Symbolic Racism Extended Scale as a measure of symbolic (modern) racist attitudes
in Australian populations. The study also found support for incorporating modern
racism items within a 'social issues' questionnaire format to reduce reactivity
concerns associated with self-report measures.
The second principal aim of this thesis (Studies 2 and 3) was to explore the
nature, prevalence and potential sources of contemporary racist attitudes, and
associated discriminatory behaviours, in an Australian context. Study 2 detected a
sizeable proportion of modern racist attitudes in both the University and ACT
Secondary College student samples. The nature of modern racist attitudes in the
population samples maintained clear consistencies with key tenets of contemporary
theories of racial prejudice. Overall the study provided further empirical evidence of
the nature, tenets and potential socio-demographic sources of modern racist attitudes
in Australian populations.
Study 3 explored modern racists' discriminatory behaviours in conditions of
low racial salience. In an employment-hiring task, high and low prejudiced
participants (university undergraduates) revealed significantly different employment
hiring preferences for an Aboriginal applicant. In providing Australian empirical
evidence of modern racists' discriminatory behaviours, the study also discussed
methodological implications for future Australian research investigating the
discriminatory behaviours of modern racists.
The third principal aim of this thesis was to provide further analysis of the
measurement of contemporary racist attitudes, specifically to examine concerns
pertaining to the measurement of racial attitudes through implicit techniques. Implicit
free-response measurement of Australian racial stereotypes in Study 4 revealed that
high and low prejudiced participants (as measured by the SR-E) were equally
knowledgable of the cultural stereotypes of Aboriginals, Asians and immigrants.
Cultural knowledge of the implicit stereotypes was found to be predominantly
independent of prejudicial beliefs, lending support to concerns (Devine, 1989; Devine
&amp; Elliot, 1995) that implicit measures of racial prejudice may actually be measuring
an individual's cultural knowledge of the primed racial group, rather than his or her
prejudicial beliefs.
The fourth principal aim of this thesis was to investigate the content of
Australian racial stereotypes. Study 4 revealed the implicit content of the cultural
stereotypes of Aborigines, Asians and immigrants to be predominantly negative in
nature. In response to the predominantly negative content of the Aboriginal cultural
stereotype, Study 5 investigated whether the recategorising of ingroup boundaries and
disconfirming information, relating to Aboriginal Australians, observed in the recent
Sydney Olympic Games would result in changes to the content of the cultural
stereotype. The study found significant decreases and increases in the negative and
positive traits respectively reported as being part of the cultural stereotype of
Aborigines, two weeks following the Sydney Olympic Games.
Together, the five studies contributed to empirical research on the changing
nature, expression and measurement of contemporary racist attitudes, discriminatory
behaviours and racial stereotypes in Australian populations. A number of theoretical
and practical implications of the present findings for Australian prejudice research are
addressed and discussed. Furthermore, a number of practical recommendations for
future research are identified to further investigate the modern nature of racist attitudes in Australian populations.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">racism</field><field name="subject">racist attitudes</field><field name="subject">racial stereotypes</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Symbolic Racism Extended Scale</field><field name="subject">discrimination</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060427.134111</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Use of systemic family therapy with adolescent suicide (patterns of belonging)</field><field name="creator">Fern, Maxime</field><field name="description">This study investigated the application of six techniques from systemic family therapy.
A review of the history of family therapy identified the major contributions from
general psychiatry, communications theory and cybernetics which had combined to
form the therapies known collectively as systemic family therapy. The theory was
outlined and examined and the major assumptions which are the basis for specific
techniques of therapy within this model were identified. Six of these techniques were
examined and demonstrated in therapy. The outcome of each technique was
assessed.
A family was seen from initial contact to termination, using a two member team
approach (Viaro and Leonardi, 1983) in which-one therapist observed the other
through a one way video arrangement. The presenting problem was a suicide
attempt by an adolescent, culminating in admission to hospital.
Therapy using the model was concluded in four sessions. Follow-up at six months
disclosed no further admissions to hospital and a report from the family that they
were satisfied with the outcome of therapy.
Distinctions between first and second order cybernetic therapy were made and the
therapists were found to adhere to a first order model. Successful and unsuccessful
use of the techniques is identified and discussed. Using as a measure the absence
of further suicide attempts and the family's self reported reduction in the number of
arguments between the parents and the identified patient, it was concluded that the
use of the nominated techniques from systemic family therapy had enabled
successful intervention.</field><field name="date">1988</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">systemic family therapy</field><field name="subject">psychiatry</field><field name="subject">communications theory</field><field name="subject">cybernetics</field><field name="subject">suicide</field><field name="subject">adolescence</field><field name="subject">family</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060505.151922</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An examination of the nature and impact of print media news reporting on selected police organisations in Australia</field><field name="creator">Jiggins, Stephen</field><field name="description">Prior to 1994 I had little interest in the activities of the police. As a mass media
consumer I was aware of the prominence of crime in the daily news agenda and I
watched, read and listened to potted summaries of rape, mayhem and murder.
Frequent too, were stories of police malpractice, incompetence and corruption. Police
stories were also a significant part of television drama with programs like the long
running British series The Bill, and a range of Australian productions: The Feds,
Halifax f.p, Rafferty's Rules, Blue Heelers, State Coroner, and Water Rats.
The police also featured at the cinema with crime genre movies Natural Born Killers
(Oliver Stone, USA), Once Were Warriors (Lee Tamahori, New Zealand) and Pulp
Fiction (Quentin Tarantino, USA) becoming box office hits.
My interest in the portrayal of police change dramatically when on the 7th of October
1994, I was appointed Officer-in-Charge of the Media and Publications Branch of the
Australian Federal Police (AFP). I was responsible for all aspects of the
communication function including: media liaison, crisis management, media
management, publications and internal communication.
My branch dealt with media inquiries from local, national and international media
across the gamut of issues facing the AFP. These ranged fiom industrial issues about
budgets and overtime, allegations of corruption and incompetence, and operational
matters as diverse as burglaries, alleged Nazi war criminals, peace-keeping operations
and drug 'busts'.
Needless to say my police stakeholders did not always see things the same way as my
media colleagues. I was seeing at a practical day-to-day level the complex taxonomy
of police/media relations outlined by Putnis (1996). Putnis noted the ubiquity of the
police and the media as social institutions and observed that their daily operations
involved a complex, dynamic, relationship constructed out of many thousands of
interactions, across all levels of the organisations, in many different settings.
My experiences in dealing with the media became the genesis of this study.
My aim is to expand our understanding of the police/media relationship by exploring
characteristic forms of print news-media reports about policing, the impact these
reports have on police, and on law and order policy.
The possibility of bias towards police in this study is acknowledged given I was a
member of a police service fiom 1994 until 2002 and the research relies heavily on
'participant observer' techniques (Kay 1997; Potter1 996; Schofield 1993). Every
effort has been made to maintain a critical perspective on the subject matters raised
and it should be noted my association with police ended prior to the writing-up phase
of the research. In addition to comments fiom my supervisory panel, ongoing
discussions with media colleagues were another strategy adopted to ensure balance in
the writing-up of this study.
This is a unique study in that it offers an insider's perspective of police/media
relations and at a time that represented a watershed for police. The early 90s was a
period of straightened finances for public sector agencies and police, like other
agencies, were under pressure fiom governments to demonstrate the efficient use of
public monies (AFP 1995; Grieve 2000). Reform programs swept through policing
with many, like the AFP, being organised along business lines (Palmer 1995; Etter
1995; Rohl 1999; WAPOL 1999). The 90s were also a watershed for criminal
organisations with the emergence of transnational criminal syndicates, such as drug
traffickers, that had the potential to impact on crime at a local level without even
entering the country, let alone the jurisdiction, in which the crime took place (Bliss
and Harfield 1998; Palmer 1995; McFarlane 1999). In order to combat these
syndicates, police began to work in a more cooperative fashion and formed loose
coalitions, often across countries, in a manner similar to the criminal syndicates they
were trying to combat (Palmer 1995). The 90s also saw the continuation of
committees of inquiry and royal commissions into police malpractice (Landa and
Dillon 1995) and the inevitable bad press for police (Wood 1996; Munday 1995).
The media and police have a symbiotic relationship and it is a critical one as most
members of society have little direct contact with the criminal justice system.
Information about crime, and the efforts of police to combat it, is obtained second
hand through fictional accounts from such vehicles as television dramas, and from the
news media. As aptly described by Hall et al. (1975), nearly thirty years ago, the
media is the link between crime and the public. The police are therefore heavily
reliant on the media to provide a balanced account of the panoply of issues
surrounding the criminal justice system (Cowdery 2001). At its most fundamental,
police require the support of the communities they serve in order to be effective, and
the news media can have a major impact on perceptions about police performance
(Reiner 1997; Surette 1992). As organisational entities, police need to compete with
other bureaucracies for public hnding, and the media is an essential tool in generating
positive publicity about successful operations and policies. The media is, therefore,
critical to the maintenance of positive relationships with the two most important
stakeholders in the policing function: the community and the government.
McGregor (1993) provides a useful summary of the literature relating to print media
coverage of policing issues: there are substantial discrepancies between official
accounts of criminal activity and press reports of crime; the media tends to
homogenise crime by concentrating on a limited range of crimes (mainly violent
crime) and drawing facts from a limited range of sources (police/court reports); the
media over-report serious crimes, especially murder and crimes with a sexual
element; and, the press concentrates crime reportage on events rather than issues, so
crime incidents and specific crimes form the bulk of crime news as opposed to
analyses of the causes of crime or remedies, trends or issues. McQuail (1994, p.256)
reminds us that assessing media performance on the basis of media content, measured
against the extent to which content relates to reality, is open to question. He argues
that there is no general answer to questions of meaning construction, but media
research has pointed to several elements in a more general framework of social and
personal meanings including clues as to what is more or less important, salient or
relevant in many different contexts (1994, p. 379).
An important research question concerns the impact of news media practices,
particularly given the significant costs to the community flowing from the
commission of crime, its investigation by police, and the processing of offenders
through the criminal justice system. The Australian Institute of Criminology estimates
the cost of crime in Australia is approximately $19 billion, while the cost of dealing
with crime is another $13 billion (Mayhew 2003). The news media, articulated
through radio talk-back hosts, are seen as having undue influence on how public funds
on crime control are spent (ABC, The Media Report, 1 August 2002; Chan 1995;
Cowdery 2001; Dixon 2002; Weatherbum 2002). These commentators have pointed
to the serious public policy issues arising from the contribution made by the media
towards what Weatherburn describes as an irrational public debate about law and
order (2002, p. 12) and Hogg and Brown have coined 'the uncivil politics of law and
order' (1998, p. 4). As Hogg and Brown (1998, p. 4) observe:
crime is depicted as a problem of ever-increasing gravity set to overwhelm society unless
urgent, typically punitive measures are taken to control and suppress it.
The influence of the media on public policy has long been recognised. As Paletz and
Entmann (l981, p. 6) observe:
they influence the decisions and actions of politicians; they are open to manipulation by the
powerful which insulates the powerful fiom accountability to the public; they reallocate power
amongst the already powerful; they decreased to a marked extent the ability of ordinary
citizens to judge events; they foment discontent among the public; and they preserve the
legitimacy of the political, economic and social system.
Ethnomethodological approaches (Ericson and Haggerty 1997) underpin the research
in this study. The ethnomethodological approach was used because of its wider scope,
employing as it does, observation, interviewing, and document-analysis techniques
(Ericson et al. 1987, p. 77) and its ability to provide meaning and context to the
phenomena under observation (Hall 1978; Willis l981). Ethnomethodological
approaches are complemented by news framing analyses (Barkin and Gurevitch 1987;
Blood, Putnis and Pirkis 2002; Capella and Jamieson 1996; Coleman 1995; Entman
1993; Kitzinger 2000; Keely 1999; Darling-Wolf 1997; London 1993; Pan and
Kosicki 2001; Miller and Riechert 2001; Pirkis and Blood 2001; Reese, Gandy and
Grant 2003; Scheufele 1999) to explore the news media frames employed in the genre
of print crime reporting.
What emerges from the study is evidence of a one-sided, highly negative, discourse
about policing implemented through a range of media frames centred on conflict and
broader xenophobic and egalitarian narratives. Despite the advantages police have as

information gatekeepers, their attempts to manage the media environment have met
with little success (Hughes 2004; Williams 2002) and the need for police to restrict
access to police communications is being challenged (Crime and Misconduct
Commission 2004, Inquiry into the effects of a Queensland Police Service decision to
adopt digital technology for radio communications). There are exceptions, of course:
the news media are not all bad. Routine reporting of crimes, where details of
offenders are publicised, greatly assists the work of police as reflected in the case of
43-year-old Mr Colin George Dunstan which is discussed in Chapter Eight. Dunstan
sent a series of explosive devices through the mail system in Canberra and police
provided the media with photographs of the devices, Mr Dunstan (who was the main
suspect), and his vehicle. The media coverage restricted Mr Dunstan's movements
and led to his early arrest. Similarly, publication of the details of missing persons,
warnings about lethal batches of drugs and crimes such as drink-spiking, enable
police to reach a mass audience efficiently and quickly. And at a more abstract level,
as noted by McQuail (1994, p. 34), modem communication vehicles can make a
positive contribution to cohesion and community.
The emergence of the 'yapping pack' form of journalism (Tiffen 1999, p. 207) has
resulted in elements of the media exercising a worrying degree of influence over what
should be a broader and better informed debate about criminal justice issues. An
illustration of this process occurred toward the end of this study with the widely
reported spectacle of the Premier of New South Wales presenting his replacement
police minister before radio presenter Mr Alan Jones for his endorsement; the
subsequent involvement of that minister in operational police matters (Williams
2002); and the departure of the state's police commissioner as a result of sustained
media attack (ABC, The Media Report, 1 August 2002; Weatherburn 2002). These
incidents say much about the influence of the news media in relation to police matters
and makes this study a timely one.
What follows is a literature review examining contemporary trends in policing and the
media; a detailed analysis of two major case studies involving complex police
operations; an analysis of a number of examples of print media reports about policing,
to identify typical, or characteristic, media frames; the findings from nearly 50
interviews with senior people involved in the policelmedia interface; and an
examination of changes in the milieu in which media reports about policing occur.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">print media</field><field name="subject">crime</field><field name="subject">policing</field><field name="subject">reporting</field><field name="subject">crime news</field><field name="subject">media coverage</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060508.154803</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Responses in estuarine macrobenthic invertebrate assemblages to trace metal contaminated sediments</field><field name="creator">Chariton, Anthony A.</field><field name="description">Three approaches were employed to examine the effects of elevated sediment trace
metal concentrations on estuarine/marine macrobenthic invertebrate assemblages. The
initial study examined macroinvertebrate communities along a known polymetallic
gradient, Lake Macquarie, NSW (gradient study). The second study experimentally
tested if sediments sourced from different locations within Lake Macquarie
differentially influenced the recolonisation of benthic invertebrates. The third study
investigated the different recolonisation patterns of benthic invertebrates into
sediments spiked with increasing concentrations of sediment-bound cadmium.
In the Lake Macquarie gradient study, four locations (Cockle Bay, Warner's Bay,
Kooroora Bay and Nord's Wharf) were sampled in winter 2000 and summer 2003
using a hierarchical design (location &gt; site &gt; plot). On both sampling occasions, the
sediments showed strong gradients in lead, cadmium and zinc concentrations
emanating from the Cockle Bay industrialised region in the lake's north, with
concentrations being significantly lower in the most southern and less urbanised
location (Nord's Wharf). In general, concentrations of lead, cadmium and zinc in the
sediments increased among locations in the following order: Nord's Wharf &gt;
Kooroora Bay &gt; Warner's Bay &gt; Cockle Bay. AVSJSEM analyses indicated that in
some sites in Cockle Bay, and to a lesser extent Warner's Bay, SEM concentrations
exceeded their molar equivalence of AVS, indicating the potential for trace metals to
be labile within the porewaters. Granulometry also changed along the gradient, with a


higher proportion of silt/clay occurring in the locations with high metal
concentrations. Conversely, the percentage of total organic carbon was higher in the
less contaminated locations.
In winter 2000, changes in benthic communities along the gradient supported the a
priori hypotheses, with diversity and richness being greater in locations with lower
concentrations of metals. Polychaetes were most numerous in Cockle Bay and
Warner's Bay, whilst bivalves and gastropods were more abundant in Nord's Wharf
and Kooroora Bay. Crustaceans were more numerous in Nord's Wharf; with all other
locations having similar, lower, abundances. Ordination maps of the assemblages
provided relatively clear separation of the assemblages among locations, with nonparametric
multivariate analysis of variance (NPMANOVA) and subsequent pair-wise
comparisons finding significant differences among the assemblages from all locations.
SIMPER analyses found the highest level of dissimilarity was between the Nord's
Wharf and Cockle Bay assemblages - primarily attributable to differences in the
relative contributions of isopods; tellenid bivalves; and the polychaete families
Spionidae, Opheliidae and Nephytidae. Weighted Spearman rank correlations (BIOENV)
identified cadmium (Pw =0.74) as the strongest environmental (single or
combination) variable to correlate with biotic assemblages.
Benthic patterns along the gradient were less defined in summer 2003 due to a
dramatic reduction in the abundance and diversity of fauna in Nord's Wharf. This
decline was possibly attributable to a sustained reduction in salinity caused by a
prolonged rainfall event. With the exception of Nord's Wharf, trends in the
community indices and abundances of key taxa among the other locations were
similar to those reported in winter 2000. Multivariate analyses discriminated the
benthic assemblages from the four locations, with the findings from the NPMANOVA
pair-wise comparisons indicating that the assemblages from all four locations were
significantly different. SIMPER analyses showed the highest level of dissimilarity
was between Nord's Wharf and Warner's Bay, with these differences being primarily
attributable to their relative abundances of amphipods and polychaetes from the
families Spionidae, Cirratulidae, Opheliidae and Capitellidae. BIOENV found that the
combination of the sedimentary concentrations of cadmium and iron provided the best
correlation (Pw =0.73) with biotic patterns, with similar correlations occumng with
the addition of lead and its covariate, zinc (Pw =0.72).
The combined findings from the gradient study established a strong correlation
between trace metal concentrations within the sediments and suite of univariate and
multivariate measurements. The low abundance and diversity of fauna in Nord's
Wharf in the summer of 2003 highlighted the dynamic changes which can occur in the
distributions of macrobenthic invertebrates. Although the study indicated that there
was a strong relationship between trace metal concentrations and benthic community
structure, the study was correlative, and requires subsequent experimental testing to
confirm the causality of the observed relationships.
The second component of the research was a translocation experiment using benthic
recolonisation as an end-point. The experiment was performed to identify if the
sediments, and not location, were influencing the composition of benthic assemblages
in Lake Macquarie. Sediments were collected from three locations (Cockle Bay,
Warner's Bay and Nord's Wharf), defaunated, and transplanted in three new locations
along the south-east edge of the lake. At each location, 10 containers of each
treatment were randomly placed in the sediment and allowed to recolonise for 22
weeks. Upon retrieval, the benthic communities were sampled and enumerated in
conjunction with a variety of chemical and sedimentary measurements. Ten replicate
invertebrate samples were also collected in the sediments adjacent to the experiment
(ambient samples) at the completion of the experiment. Due to human interference,
the containers from only two locations were analysed.
Upon retrieval, pH and redox profiles of the sediments were similar to those expected
in natural sediments. In general, concentrations of metals were low in the porewaters;
however, iron precipitation on the porewater collection devices may have artificially
increased the diffusion of metals, increasing concentrations near the sediment-water
interface. Concentrations of SEM exceeded their AVS equivalence in some samples
taken from the Cockle Bay and Warner's Bay treatments.
Two-way ANOVAs found significant interactions between location and sediment
treatments in diversity, evenness and the number of polychaetes, as well as significant
differences in the number of capitellids and crustaceans among locations. Post-hoc
comparisons of means found the Nord's Wharf sediment contained a higher mean
number of individuals than the other treatments, including the ambient samples.
nMDS ordination plots for both locations provided poor graphical discrimination of
the assemblages among treatments; however, NPMANOVA detected significant
location and treatment interactions. In both locations, pair-wise comparisons indicated
that the assemblages within the Nord's Wharf treatments were significantly different
to the Cockle Bay, Warner's Bay and ambient assemblages. No significant differences
were detected between the Cockle Bay and Warner's Bay assemblages at either
location. SIMPER analyses found the highest level of dissimilarity occurred between
the ambient assemblages in Location 2 and the Nord's Wharf treatment, primarily due
to the relative difference in the abundances of Capitellidae, Spionidae, Oweniidae,
Nereididae and isopods among the assemblages.
The findings from the translocation experiment suggest that the sediments are
influencing the recolonisation of benthos. However, because differences were not
detected between the Cockle Bay and Warner's Bay treatments, the approach used in
the study shows potential as an in situ technique which could be used to assess the
potential ecological risks of sediments fiom specific locations. Excluding cost and
time considerations, the technique's primary disadvantage is the lack of a true control.
As a result, the technique can only identify if the sediments are modifying benthic
recolonisation, and not causality.
The final component of the research experimentally tested if elevated concentrations
of sediment-bound cadmium affected benthic invertebrate recolonisation. Sediments
from the south coast of New South Wales (Durras Lake) were defaunated, and spiked
with cadmium under anaerobic conditions to obtain three targeted cadmium
concentrations: control (&lt;O.1 ug/g), Low-Cd (15 Cd ug/g) and High-Cd (150 Cd
ug/g). The physio-chemical properties of the waters and porewater concentrations of
cadmium were monitored over a 28-day equilibration period, with declines in pH
mediated with the addition of NaOH(aq). At the end of the equilibration period,
porewater concentrations of cadmium were low in the Low-Cd and High-Cd
treatments (maximum &lt;l.5 ug/L in High-Cd), and below the detection limit in the
control. Cadmium was not detected in the control sediments, with concentrations in
the Cd-Low and Cd-High sediments exceeding their targeted concentrations, with
final mean concentrations of 17 ug/g and 183 ug/g, respectively.
The experimental design was similar to that employed in the translocation experiment,
with 10 containers from each treatment transplanted into the sediments at three
locations within Lake Macquarie. After 20 weeks, the containers were collected,
along with benthic invertebrate samples from the ambient sediments. Data was not
used from Location C due to extensive sediment deposition on the transplanted
treatments. Significant declines occurred in the concentrations of cadmium in both the
Low-Cd and High-Cd sediments, with the greatest loss occumng in the surficial
sediments. The loss of cadmium was probably due to the differential loss of the fine

fraction through physical means (hydrodynamic) rather than fluxing, as it assumed
that the cadmium was primarily sediment-bound and relatively insoluble under anoxic
conditions. Mean porewater concentrations of cadmium were below the detection
limit in the control treatments; &lt; 1 ug/L in the Low-Cd treatment, and generally &lt;
2ug/L in the High-Cd, with the exception of some samples in Location B (maximum
5.6 ug/L) Concentrations of ammonia were low in the porewaters from the surficial
sediments, with concentrations being significantly higher, and potentially toxic, in the
anoxic porewaters (7 cm depth).
In comparison to the previous recolonisation experiment, the number of individuals
which recolonised the cadmium-spiked treatments was low, and significantly lower
than the mean number of individuals sampled in the ambient sediments. No
significant differences were detected among the treatments or locations (and their
interactions) in diversity (H'), richness (d) or evenness (J). The number of polychaetes
and molluscs significantly differed among the treatments, with post-hoc analyses
indicating these differences were not among the cadmium-spike treatments, but were
due to a greater mean abundance of these taxa in the ambient sediments. A significant
interaction between treatment and location was detected in the mean abundance of
crustaceans, with the ambient sediments having significantly lower mean abundances
in both Location A and B. Ordination plots of the experiments in Location A and B
provided poor graphical discrimination among the spiked treatments, although the
ambient assemblages appear to be separated from the cadmium-spiked assemblages.
NPMANOVA detected a significant interaction between treatments and locations, as
well as among treatments. In both Location A and B, pair-wise analyses found the
assemblages in the ambient sediments to be significantly different to the assemblages
in all three cadmium treatments, with no differences being detected among the latter.
SIMPER analyses found the highest levels of dissimilarity occurred between the
spike-treatments and the ambient sediments, with these differences being primarily

due to the relatively higher abundance of decapods in the spiked treatments, and
capitellids in the ambient sediments.
The cadmium-spiking component of the experiment clearly illustrated that artificially
increasing the trace metal concentrations of metals in estuarine sediments is a
complex process which needs to be performed in a methodological manner in order to
obtain homogenous treatments with low porewater concentrations, and minimal
artefacts. Furthermore, the results confirmed that the equilibration time for sediments
can be extensive (several weeks), even in the case of organically rich sediments. The
timing of the experiment (commenced late summer, February, 2003) appears to the
major factor for the relatively low recolonisation rates, with the experiment missing
the main larval recolonisation period between spring and early summer. Even in the
highest treatment, elevated concentrations of cadmium did not appear to affect benthic
recolonisation. This finding is supported by other experimental studies which suggest
that concentrations of a single isolated metal must considerably exceed current
guideline values (or contain high porewater concentrations) in order to elicit a
biological effect. Nevertheless, as trace metals generally co-occur with other
contaminants - with the response of multiple contaminants being possibly additive or
synergistic - a conservative guideline value may be suitable in the interim as a
precautionary measure.
The findings of this thesis suggest that elevated concentrations of trace metal mixtures
in estuarine sediments can affect the structure and composition of benthic
communities; however, identifying causality is difficult. Although there has been an
increase in the use of manipulative field experiments as a means of reducing the
confounding influence of covariables found in field studies, this approach also has
limitations, e.g. spatial and temporal scale issues, container effects, cost and
biogeochemical changes to the sediments. Measuring stress at a community level is a

fundamental component of estuarine risk assessment programs; and in isolation this
approach can produce subjective and confounded findings. In order to accurately
assess the risks associated with trace metal contaminated sediments, an integrated
approach (e.g. weight of evidence) is required, one which uses multiple lines of
evidence sourced from various chemical, environmental biological measurements.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">metal contaminated sediments</field><field name="subject">estuarine macrobenthic invertebrate assemblages</field><field name="subject">macroinvertebrate communities</field><field name="subject">Lake Macquarie</field><field name="subject">New South Wales</field><field name="subject">NSW</field><field name="subject">benthic invertebrates</field><field name="subject">cadmium</field><field name="subject">sediment</field><field name="subject">lead</field><field name="subject">zinc</field><field name="subject">estuarine pollution</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060509.115744</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Information systems for regional sugar cane production forecasting and localised yield estimation: a Thailand perspective</field><field name="creator">Onpraphai, Thaworn</field><field name="description">Sugar is an important global agricultural commodity and a significant input to the
advanced industrialised world. Annual average global sugar production is around 120
million tonnes, with consumption around 118 million tonnes. Sugar is produced under
a broad range of climatic conditions in some 120 countries and is one of the most
heavily traded agricultural commodities (FAO, 2001). Plants produce sugar as a
storehouse of energy that is used as required. Approximately 70% of sugar is
produced from sugar cane while the remaining 30% is produced from sugar beet
(Sugar Knowledge International, 2001).
Thailand's cane and sugar industry is now one of the major sources of foreign income
for the country. The value of sugar exports (around 35 billion baht or AUD $1.5
billion per annum) ranks among the top ten exported commodities of the Thai
economy. Approximately 9.2% of annual global sugar production is exported from
Thailand (WTO, 2001).
The sugar industry is extremely complex and comprises individual links and
components in the supply and demand chain that are more delicately in balance than
with most other commodity based industries. Thailand's sugar production has been
characterized by greater extremes of variability than in most other sugar producing
countries. A unique combination of pests, disease, climate, soils, problems with plant
available moisture and the low technology basis of crop management has increased
production risk and uncertainty for the crop. Total tonnage of cane and sugar is
notoriously difficult to predict during the growing season and for a mature crop before
the harvest.
Accordingly, the focus of this research is on the development and testing of methods,
algorithms, procedures and output products for Sugar Cane Crop Forecasting and
Yield Mapping. The resulting spatial and temporal information tools have the potential
to provide the basis of a commercially deployable decision support system for
Thailand's sugar industry.
The scope of this thesis encompasses several levels within a geographical hierarchy of
scales; from regional, district, farm, and plot within a study area in northeastern
Thailand. Crop forecasting at regional level will reduce production risk uncertainty
while yield mapping and yield estimation at local, farm and plot scales will enable
productivity to be improved by identifying, diagnosing the cause of and reducing
yield variability.
The research has three main objectives. These are to:
Develop statistical analysis procedures and empirical algorithms expressing the
relationship between yield potential and spectral response of sugar cane yield as a
basis for mapping, monitoring, modeling, forecasting and management of sugar
production in Thailand.
Evaluate the validity of a technology based versus conventional approach to crop
forecasting and yield mapping, commencing with a series of testable null-hypotheses
and culminating in procedures to calibrate and validate empirical
models against verifiable production records. Outcomes are used to review and
evaluate existing and potential future approaches to regional crop forecasting,
localised yield mapping and yield estimation tools for operational use within
Thailand's sugar industry.
Identify, evaluate and establish performance benchmarks in relation to the
practicality, accuracy, timeliness, cost effectiveness and value proposition of a
satellite based versus conventional approach to crop forecasting and yield
mapping.
The methodology involved time series analysis of recorded sugar cane yields and
production outcomes paired with spectral response statistics of crops derived from
satellite imagery and seasonal rainfall records over a three year period within four
provinces, forty five component districts and 120 representative farms.
Spectral statistics were derived fiom raw multi-spectral satellite imagery (multitemporal
SPOT- VI at regional scale and Landsat 7 ETM+ imagery at local scale)
acquired during the 1999 to 2001 sugar cane seasons. Crop area and production
statistics at regional scale were compiled and furnished by the provincial sugar mill
and verified through government agencies within Thailand. Selective cutting at
sample sites within nominated fields owned by collaborating growers was undertaken
to validate localised differences in productivity and to facilitate yield variance
mapping.
Acquisition, processing, analysis and statistical modeling of remotely sensed satellite
spectral data, rainfall records and production outcomes were accomplished using an
empirical approach. Resulting crop production forecasting algorithms were
systematically evaluated for reliability by assessing accuracy, spatial and temporal
variability. Long term rainfall and district sugar cane yield and production records
were used to account for district and season specific differences between estimated
and recorded yields, to generate error probability functions and to improve the
accuracy and applicability of empirical models under more extreme conditions.
Limitations on finding and length of records constrained the number of seasons and
the area for which satellite imagery with contrasting levels of spatial and spectral
resolution could be acquired. The absence of verifiable long term production records
combined with limitations on the duration and area able to be covered by field trips
meant that time series analysis of paired data was necessarily constrained to a three
year period of record coinciding with the author's period of candidature. Accordingly,
although a comprehensive set of well correlated district and month specific yield
forecasting algorithms was able to be developed, temporal restrictions on data
availability constrained the extent to which they could be subjected to thorough
accuracy and reliability analysis and extended with confidence down to farm and field
scale.
A variety of approaches, using different parameter combinations and threshold values,
was used to combine individual districts and component farms into coherent groups to
overcome temporal data constraints and to generate more robust production
forecasting algorithms, albeit with slightly lower levels of apparent accuracy and
reliability. The procedures adopted to optimise these district groupings are
systematically explained. Component differences in terrain, biophysical conditions
and management approaches between district groupings are used to explain
differences in production outcomes and to account for apparent differences between

forecast versus actual yields between districts both within and between different
groups.
The outcomes of this research - particularly the data acquisition and analysis
procedures, empirical modeling, error assessment and adjustment techniques, and the
optimisation procedures used to facilitate grouping of districts - provide a practical
basis for the deployment of an operational sugar cane production forecasting and yield
mapping information system to facilitate planning and logistical management of
production, harvesting, transportation, processing, domestic marketing and export of
sugar from northeastern Thailand. At the local and farm level, yield maps and plot
based yield estimates will assist users to improve productivity by recognising,
identiwing and responding to potential causes of within and between field spatial
variability.
However, before such an information system can be confidently deployed, additional
resources will be required to obtain paired production records, spectral data fiom
satellite imagery and biophysical input data over a longer period to ensure that the
empirical models are operationally robust and to validate their accuracy under a wider
range of conditions by comparing forecasts with actual outcomes over larger areas
during the next few seasons.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">sugar</field><field name="subject">sugar production</field><field name="subject">Thailand</field><field name="subject">sugar cane industry</field><field name="subject">crop forecasting</field><field name="subject">sugar cane yields</field><field name="subject">yield mapping</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060517.142422</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Oxic and anoxic transformations of leaf derived organic matter in freshwater systems</field><field name="creator">Conway, Carol Leza</field><field name="description">In Australia, significant effort goes into reducing the amount of nitrogen and phosphorus
entering inland waters from point sources. However, little is known of the extent to
which riparian organic matter may act as a source of these nutrients. Also, whilst the relationships
between the nitrogen, phosphorus and carbon cycles are broadly known, there
is little quantitative data regarding the release of these elements from Australian riparian
organic matter and their subsequent microbial mineralisation within aquatic environments.
In particular, comparatively little is known of their comparative role in nutrient and organic
matter cycling within anoxic zones, and the influence that different riparian organic matter
may have on stream water quality. This lack of such data presently hampers the ability of
water managers to make educated decisions regarding the management of riparian zones
in Australia. In order to improve understanding in this area, a combination of laboratory
and in situ experiments were carried out in order to compare the abiotic release and aerobic/
anaerobic mineralisation of leaf derived dissolved organic carbon (DOC), dissolved
nitrate/nitrite (NOx) and soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) under different environmental
conditions. Four plants common to Australian riparian zones were investigated: two native
species, Eucalyptus camaldulensis (gum) and Phragmites australis (common reed), and
two exotic species, Salix babylonica (willow) and Lolium multiflorum (rye grass). After 30
days, formaldehyde inhibited 1g willow and rye grass extracts contained the most SRP (0.7
mg/L), whilst gum extracts contained 0.3 mg/L and common reed 0.1 mg/L of SRP.Willow
and rye grass abiotically released twice as much NOx than gum and common reed, although
concentrations were only between 0.05-0.1 mg/L. Gum and common reed released the most
DOC per gram of leaf matter (14 and 12 mmol/g of leaf matter respectively), but based on
the initial carbon content of each leaf type, the largest percentage contributor of DOC under
abiotic conditions was common reed and rye grass (both 38% mass/mass), with gum (33%

mass/mass) and willow (30% mass/mass) being smaller contributors. The most bioavailable
DOC was released by rye grass and common reed, with between 83 and 94% of this
DOC microbially mineralised after 30 days in oxic conditions. When conditions were not
inhibited, microbial growth was evident almost immediately in willow, rye grass and common
reed leaf extracts. However, microbial growth was suppressed for the first 48 hours
in gum leaf extracts. After this suppression period, the rate of DOC mineralisation was
equal in willow and gum leaf extracts (0.1 day-1). Under anoxic conditions, the rate and
extent of DOC mineralisation of willow and gum leaves depended on the type of electron
acceptor provided. Added nitrate and iron III enhanced the mineralisation of both willow
and gum leaves relative to no terminal electron acceptors (from zero to 0.01-0.04 and 0.002-
0.004 moles/day respectively), but added sulphate only enhanced the mineralisation of gum
leaves (0.04 moles/day). When no additional electron acceptors were provided, particulate
leaf mineralisation was more extensive under oxic than anoxic conditions. However, the
mineralisation of leaf derived DOC were the same regardless of oxygen availability, and
after 35 days in either condition the percentage of leaf DOC mineralised for each leaf type
was of the order common reed &gt; rye grass &gt; willow &gt; gum. All the leaf types tested were
able to sustain the caddis fly larvae Triplectides australis under controlled laboratory conditions,
and survival rates were high using all four leaf types as a food source. Triplectides
australis did not significantly increase the amount of DOC released from each type of leaf
matter, but they did consistently increase the proportion of simple carbohydrates present
within the DOC fraction. The results of these experiments suggest that changes to riparian
vegetation, particularly from the native to exotic species used in this study, will inherently
alter in-stream concentrations of dissolved carbon and nutrients (particularly SRP). This
potentially will affect in-stream, hyporheic and subsurface processes, particularly in areas
where surface water flow is low and riparian leaf inputs are high.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">nitrogen</field><field name="subject">phosphorus</field><field name="subject">inland waters</field><field name="subject">riparian organic matter</field><field name="subject">oxic zones</field><field name="subject">anoxic zones</field><field name="subject">carbon cycling</field><field name="subject">freshwater systems</field><field name="subject">Eucalyptus camaldulensis</field><field name="subject">gum</field><field name="subject">Phragmites australis</field><field name="subject">common reed</field><field name="subject">Salix babylonica</field><field name="subject">willow</field><field name="subject">Lolium multiflorum</field><field name="subject">rye grass</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060519.105559</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Regolith-landform mapping and dryland salinity investigaton: Booberoi-Quandialla Transect, Western New South Wales</field><field name="creator">Holzapfel, Michael</field><field name="description">Landholders in the Booberoi to Quandialla (B-Q) Transect area, located in central west
NSW, have been concerned about an emerging dryland salinity problem since the late
1990&#65533;s (Wooldridge 2002, pers. comm. Muller 2002, pers. comm.) with borehole
information and electromagnetic induction investigations supporting anecdotal
observations. The presence of indicator vegetation, waterlogging of soils and
salinisation of land are becoming increasingly prevalent, with two well-documented
sites including &#65533;Strathairlie&#65533; near Quandialla, and &#65533;Back Creek&#65533; near West Wyalong.
The B-Q Transect area lies within the Bland Creek Catchment, a broad open plain of
subdued topography and restricted drainage receiving sediments from elevated rises
located to the west, south and east. Significant deposits of transported alluvial materials
have in-filled the catchment to depths in excess of 160 m and have posed a particular
impediment to regional-scale mineral exploration. Stream flow across the alluvial
plains and low angle alluvial fans is intermittent with most of the flow being diverted
into groundwater storage or lost to evaporation. Rarely do streams flow into Lake
Cowal to the north.
A partial electromagnetic (EM) induction survey coupled with a long term bore and
piezometer network monitoring program have been implemented by the Department of
Infrastructure, Planning and Natural Resources (DIPNR &#65533; formerly Department of Land
and Water Conservation) Central West NSW Salt Group. These programs allow for
initial, broad-scale evaluation of the magnitude and spatial distribution of the salinity
problem but fail to pinpoint remaining sites at risk as well as the mechanisms of salt
emplacement.
As part of an approach to assist with hazard mitigation and land management, two
regolith-landform maps are being compiled using 1:20,000 scales in the Back Creek and
Quandialla areas. A third, more regional regolith-landform map at 1:50,000 scale
(Holzapfel &amp; Moore 2003a, b &amp; c) provides context for the more detailed mapping
areas. The new regolith-landform maps will aid in interpretation of existing geophysical
techniques, help piece together the three-dimensional characteristics of the Bland Creek
catchment, aid in the development of a shallow fluid flow and palaeotopographic model
and assist land managers in formulating land management units (LMU&#65533;s).
The three-dimensional integration of regolith-landform mapping, electromagnetic
studies, bore information and other geophysical methods is critical in determining the

interaction, distribution and movement of groundwater in the Bland Creek Catchment as
buried palaeochannels represent preferred fluid pathways. The distribution of these
palaeochannels has implications for future dryland salinity outbreaks, the remediation of
current outbreaks and mineral exploration closer to the well-known Wyalong Goldfield
(Lawrie et al., 1999).
The western quarter of the B-Q Transect area partially overlaps with the recently
completed GILMORE Project (Lawrie et al., 2003a,b &amp; c), a multi-disciplinary study,
coordinated by Geoscience Australia (GA) and the Bureau of Rural Sciences (BRS).
Regolith-landform information in addition to gamma-ray spectrometry, magnetics,
airborne electromagnetics and a digital elevation model acquired by the GILMORE
Project have been incorporated into regolith-landform maps over the B-Q Transect. The
incorporation of these datasets has helped not only extend the usefulness of the
GILMORE Project data but provide a consistent, regolith-landform coverage for the
broader Bland Creek Catchment.
Regolith-landform mapping has been successful in highlighting major recharge zones
for local and intermediate flow systems. The mechanisms for dryland salinity at two
well-known sites have also been determined. Increasing salt stores are occurring
through evaporation of intermittent floodwaters sourced from floodplains, back plains
and broad meandering existing creek systems and recharging partially exposed
palaeochannels intersecting the surface. Due to the shallow nature of these partially
exposed palaeochannels, evaporation further concentrates the salt load in the soil
profile. It is unknown if mapped shallow palaeochannels further away from current
drainage systems are affected by rising salt loads.
Regolith-landform mapping highlights two additional risk factors common to the
1:50,000 and 1:20,000 scale B-Q Transect mapping areas including widespread
waterlogging of soils and wind erosion. Due to the subdued topography, features such
as gilgai, fences and roads are having an effect on drainage modification. Wind erosion
was also observed to play a major role within the B-Q Transect with significant loss of
topsoil creating hardened clay surfaces resistant to water infiltration and significant
redistributed deposits of aeolian materials.
Interpretation of regolith-landform mapping against geophysical datasets and drill hole
data show considerable lateral and vertical variation of regolith units. This variation of
regolith distribution with depth does not reduce the effectiveness of using regolithlandform
mapping as a valued management tool. The subdued relief coupled with the


complex interplay between recharge zones, discharge zones and surficial drainage
networks over the B-Q Transect still requires a detailed knowledge of surface regolithlandform
characteristics whilst reinforcing the need for a multidisciplinary approach to
gain a 3D perspective.
Catchment analysis has been performed on drainage systems within the Bland Creek
Catchment and has helped explain the strong effect different catchments have had on
sediment supply to the Bland Basin. Catchment analysis results have been used in basic
calculations of salt loads in the Bland Creek Catchment. An estimated 18,780 Tonnes/yr
of salt enter the Bland Creek catchment and as stream flow out of the Bland Creek
Catchment is intermittent, salt stores are increasing in the upper margins of the soil
profile and groundwater reserves.
Reconstruction of the palaeotopography of the B-Q Transect has been made possible
using a mutli-disciplinary approach incorporating information from regolith-landform
mapping, drill hole information, gamma-ray spectrometry and GILMORE Project
datasets. The production of large-scale regolith-landform mapping, the development of
a shallow fluid flow model and reconstruction of palaeotopography builds on and
contributes to knowledge of the Bland Creek Catchment allowing for detailed farmscale
and paddock-scale land management decisions.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">regolith-landform mapping</field><field name="subject">salinity</field><field name="subject">dryland salinity</field><field name="subject">Booberoi-QuandiallaTransect</field><field name="subject">New South Wales</field><field name="subject">NSW</field><field name="subject">Bland Creek Catchment</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060519.144945</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An enquiry into the effects of a tutoring program on forty-eight disadvantaged students and their families</field><field name="creator">Pierce, Robyn</field><field name="description">This thesis focuses on two research questions:
1. What is the impact of Barnardos&#65533; Tutoring Program on the students
involved?
2. How has the program influenced the parents, teachers and tutors?
In examining the literature I have identified a complex set of dynamics that affects
students&#65533; school performance. The themes of relevance to this study are: the concept of
disadvantage and poverty; the role of literacy and numeracy in educational attainment; the
importance of social acceptance for student well-being; aspects of mentoring and tutoring,
and issues related to homework.
In this study I examine the degree to which a tutor&#65533;s involvement improves students&#65533;
homework performance, literacy and numeracy, social skills and engagement with school.
I also examine how the tutoring program enhances parents&#65533; involvement with their
children&#65533;s education. And I assess the tutors&#65533; contribution, the influence of the program
on the teachers, and the implications for the program.
My methods involved sending questionnaires out to 44 teachers, 41 students, 40 parents
and 44 tutors. I also interviewed seven students under 10 years old. In addition to the
questionnaires, I interviewed a core group of parents, students, teachers and tutors who
had been involved with the program since 1999 (six tutors, five students, five parents and
four teachers).
My findings indicate that homework places considerable strain on students who do not
have adequate resources or support available to them, in their homes, to undertake their
homework tasks. Tutoring programs which take place outside of the school environment
and which are based on the one-to-one principle of mentoring programs offer considerable
benefits to students and their families. The study indicates that the tutoring program has
brought about significant changes to the homes and the lives of the students. These
changes include a greater engagement with learning and an increased interest in school.
The students also have better relationships with their peers and feel that they are valued
members of their class. The parents believe that they have the support that they need and
as a result there is less tension in the home with regard to homework.
The study also suggests that although the main role of the tutors is to help at-risk students
with their homework and schoolwork, their role is much more diverse.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">tutors</field><field name="subject">tutoring</field><field name="subject">disadvantaged students</field><field name="subject">Barnardos Tutoring Program</field><field name="subject">mentoring</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060525.150249</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Country-specific determinants of vertical and horizontal intra-industry trade: an empirical analysis of South Africa</field><field name="creator">Al-Mawali, Nasser</field><field name="description">The principal purpose of this study is to provide a refined empirical investigation concerning
country-specific determinants of horizontal and vertical intra-industry trade (IIT,) in relation to
South Africa using the gravity model of trade in a panel data setting. Prior to investigating the
case of South Africa's intra-industry trade a critical review of the relevant theoretical,
methodologcal, and empirical literature is provided. The study operationalises the theoretical
dstinction between horizontal and vertical IIT using the latest methodology of decomposing total
IIT into horizontal intra-industry trade (HIIq and vertical intra-industry trade (WIT,).
Thts study makes several advances on earlier empirical studies of intra-industry trade
determinants. These include the introduction of new countq-specific determinants of intraindustry
trade that previous studies have not examined. Furthermore, it is the first empirical study
that traces the relationshp between intra-industry trade flows and intellectual property rights
(IPRs). Moreover, to ensure the sensitivity and robustness of the results, several econometric
approaches have been used in estimating the gravity model of South Africa's intra-industry trade:
the consistent coefficient approach, the fixed effects approach, the random effects approach, and
the between effects approach.
The econometric results are generally satisfactory in terms of economic interpretation and
statistical significance and thus offer new empirical validation to the theoretical explanatory
variables. The key findngs suggest the following: the volume of South Africa's IIT has increased
during the study period and its WIT exceeds its HIIT. The latter result reflects the nature of
South Africa's trade as it imports high valued added products and exports primary and mineral
products. South Africa's intra-industry trade and its two components are positively related to
market size and standard of living, and negatively related to geographcal distance. Furthermore,
separately, the IPRs and the imitation ability of South Africa's tradmg partners are not important
factors in determining IIT flows; however, the interaction between them is an important factor.
Thts study also reveals South Africa should pursue its intra-industry trade with rest of world
concentrating on local industries that produce most competitive varieties, absorbing labor and
other resources from the production of other varieties.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">intra-industry trade</field><field name="subject">South Africa</field><field name="subject">VIIT</field><field name="subject">HIIT</field><field name="subject">gravity model</field><field name="subject">intellectual property rights</field><field name="subject">IPRs</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060526.120413</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Concerning bears, tigers and elephants : as exploration of health education in ACT schools</field><field name="creator">Ackermann, Antoinette</field><field name="description">This study presents an evaluation of health
education in schools in the Australian Capital Territory,
listing as evidence the perceptions and experiences of
students and teachers at three levels of schooling. There
is a particular emphasis on the high school. First, a
broad-based literature review was undertaken, in order
to arrive at some theoretical principles for health
education. For the evaluation itself a combination of
methods has been used including student questionnaires,
teacher interviews, group discussion, participant
observation and analysis of documents. While the questionnaire
was the major research tool, all sources are integrated
in the final discussion in order to provide a broad picture
of health education at the different school levels.
Conclusions drawn from the review of literature
include (i) that contemporary health education in the
Western world is concerned with the quality of life and
with the decisions, at both individual and community levels,
which relate to lifestyle, and (ii) the inevitability of
social change had led to the recognition in the United
Kingdom, United States of America and Australia of the need
for young people to develop strategies for coping with a
changing environment. In Australian Capital Territory
schools, health education has been recognised as carrying
the responsibility for developing these strategies. A key
theme emerging from the review and explored in the
evaluation is that, if these goals are to be achieved,
particular emphasis must be placed on the process of
learning and on the social emotional environment as an
integral part of that process.
In order to explore this hypothesis information
was collected on student and teacher perceptions of the
above concepts of health education and how these differ
in a range of schools. To this end six schools which
Positively identified health education as part of their
curriculum were used as case studies. As individual
schools they were found to approach this in different
ways and these different approaches build a broad picture of school health education in action. It was found
however, that there were major difficulties in effectively
incorporating contemporary health education in schools.
These difficulties repeat those already
identified in my review of health education in Australian
schools in this century. A "reaction pattern" of "bandaid"
response to social change is repeatedly incorporated
into the traditional education curriculum of the time
under the title of health education.
In the present era, there can be identified a
mismatch between the objectives of contemporary health
education and the present educational paradigm. A major
finding in this regard was the failure of the high school
to match up either to needs of students or the ideals of
health education. While the fulfilment of these ideals
was shown to be possible given specific teacher qualities,
it was also found to be inhibited by a range of
environmental factors. Examples of these were found to
be organisational barriers and staff and student pressure
to conform to the established structure and to the
established roles. The study highlights the frustrating
position of the teacher who seeks, or is given, the task
of implementing contemporary health education in presentday
schools.</field><field name="date">1983</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">health education</field><field name="subject">high schools</field><field name="subject">Australian Capital Territory</field><field name="subject">social change</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060529.111013</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A case study of the relationship between sports science research practice and elite coaches' perceived needs</field><field name="creator">Williams, Stephen John</field><field name="description">Elite coaches consider aspects of sports science when preparing athletes for
competition. Sports scientists conduct applied research and a fundamental purpose of
sports science research is to produce knowledge that helps improve the performance of
elite athletes. In view of the considerable resources being directed toward research and
coaching at the elite level, there is a need to conduct research to identify the relationship
between research and coaching practice at the elite level.
Australia has an institute of sport or academy of sport in each state and territory
dedicated to the development of team and individual sports, both Olympic and non-
Olympic. In the area of elite athlete performance, the Australian Institute of Sport (AIS)
has gained an international reputation for excellence, and the AIS Research Centre has
achieved international recognition for the quality of research projects directed toward
the performance of elite athletes. Sports scientists at Australian universities also
undertake research related to elite coaching, some of which has occurred in partnership
with researchers at Australian institutes of sport.
The purpose of the study was to identify the relationship between sports science
research at Australian institutes of sport and post-graduate sports science research in
Australian universities, and how elite coaches in Australia perceive sports science
research practice meeting the needs of elite coaching.
A case study method was selected for this thesis, which involved the following data
gathering instruments: a survey of 225 elite coaches and 125 sports science researchers,
follow-up interviews of elite coaches and sports science researchers, and document
analysis of 725 research projects conducted at Australian institutes of sport and postgraduate
theses at Master and Doctoral level at Australian universities. An analysis was
also conducted to assess the sports science content contained in the National Coaching
Accreditation Scheme's Level Three course material. A schedule was developed for the
document analysis called the "Williams Sports Science Research Schedule". Interviews
were conducted with elite key informants to validate a model that was developed fiom
the study.
Results of the study revealed a degree of congruence between the perceptions of elite
coaches and sports science researchers regarding the research needs of elite coaches and
the research activity of sports science researchers. A model, called the "Elite Sports
Research Model" was developed to describe that relationship. The Elite Sports Research
Model contains four components, namely: coach knowledge, information seeking/dissemination strategies, qualities valued in an elite coach and a sports science
researcher, and application of research. Within the model, particular perspectives of
elite coaches and particular perspectives of sports science researchers were identified.
Some differences were found between elite coaches of team sports and elite coaches of
individual sports, as well as some differences between researchers at institutes of sports
and researchers at universities. At the elite level in Australia a relationship was found
between sports science research activity and the research needs of elite coaches.
With the increase in support for elite coaching and sports science research in Australia
and internationally, the results of this study should help to inform improvement in
sports science research programs that support elite coaching practice.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">sports science</field><field name="subject">elite coaches</field><field name="subject">coaching</field><field name="subject">case study</field><field name="subject">Australian Institute of Sport</field><field name="subject">AIS</field><field name="subject">research</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060530.101909</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Djungayin, Bungawa or Mr Chairman : analysis of management in a remote aboriginal community council in east Arnhem land</field><field name="creator">Adepoyibi, A.

through the development of self-regulation
in planning and producing text</field><field name="creator">Agafonoff, Annabel</field><field name="description">The dual problem space model of writing (Scardamalia, Bereiter and Steinbach,
1984) shows how writers develop their knowledge and understanding of the world
by reflecting on problems of substance and problems of presentation in planning a
composition. Reflective thought is attributed to a two-way communication
between a content problem space and a rhetorical problem space. The content
space involves the development of ideas, while the rhetorical space is concerned
with achieving various purposes in composition.
This thesis reports an instructional experiment comparing alternative approaches to
teaching the self-regulatory strategies required for the two-way process of
reflection. The experiment compared the dialogue approach of current practice,
which relies on the teacher to provide the linking operations between the two
problem spaces, with two experimental approaches which promote development of
self-regulatory strategies of reflection, so that students are able to sustain such a
two-way process independently. The experimental approaches are described as a
guided discovery approach proposed by Evans (1991) and an approach described
as cognitive apprenticeship developed by Scardamalia, Bereiter and Steinbach
(1984).
Three instructional programs were prepared by the author to represent the three
alternative approaches examined in the present study. The control program utilised
the dialogue approach of current practice in which the dialectical process is carried
on between teacher and student. The two experimental programs focused on promoting processes of self-questioning rather than questioning by an external
agent such as a teacher. The guided discovery program consisted of activities
which prompted self-questioning processes. The cognitive apprenticeship program
employed scaffolding in the form of procedural facilitation cues to stimulate the
self-questioning process.
A pre-test and post-test control group design was used involving three groups, two
experimental (guided discovery and cognitive apprenticeship) and one control
(dialogue), with instructional method as the independent variable and rated
reflectiveness of writing as the dependent variable. Instruction was concentrated on
teaching the two-way problem formulating and problem solving strategies of the
reflective process for opinion essays and factual exposition essays. The experiment
compared the effectiveness of programs by measuring changes in overall
reflectiveness of writing. Significant improvements were obtained for the
experimental teaching methods withrespect to opinion essays. This research
provided some support for the hypothesis that instruction which fosters self-regulation

organisation in decline. Customs' history has been sporadically influenced by
numerous reports that identify many instances of 'maladministration'. More recently,
instances, such as the 'Midford Paramount Affair', have brought media and public
notoriety to Customs followed by the establishment of the Review of the ACS in May
1993 (The Conroy Report). This, the latest and most comprehensive report
undertaken on the ACS, documented administrative malfunctions of a major kind.
Each report, using its own rationale has recommended more advanced levels of
information technology (IT) application.
To study these protracted administrative issues, the author has used, as the basis of
analysis, a dynamic contingent decision-paths schema as well as furthering the
theoretical constructs of organisational 'reliability' theory. The dynamic contingent
decision-paths schema is designed to provide a conceptual framework regarding
public (and private) sector situations of agency decline, evaluation, strategic response
and finally 'turnaround' policy and implementation. The ACS is now implementing a
comprehensive turnaround strategy, which includes new and novel information
technologies.
Organisational 'reliability' theory relates to organisations that are required to be
highly reliable in their daily work-related activities otherwise crises of some major
magnitude may occur. These organisations need to practice near perfect
organisational and decision-making performance, and tend to be highly technical,
relying increasingly in turn on information technology in managing their respective
systems or operations. Customs was an early innovator in using Electronic Data
Interchange and is now pursuing e-commerce, which in part is being outsourced, to
EDS, a multinational company.
The study initially reviews the recent history of the ACS - 'mapping' the nature of the
organisation's decline, raising relevant factors which the author argues may be seen
as successive 'crisis points', and lastly, addresses the strategic 'turnaround' policies of
the organisation.
The author believes the nadir for Customs has been reached and there are now
positive signs that the ACS has commenced its organisational 'turnaround'.
Organisational design matters including structural and cultural issues have been
addressed which has allowed Customs to forge new relationships with its clients, as
well as fostering 'new' management philosophies. These new philosophies and
relationships, together with participation with an industry lead advisory team and a
new internal management team, have provided the catalyst for change and recovery.
Political and industry pressure and their formal involvement in a recovery strategy
provide a high level of confidence for Customs' future and the strategic and
operational changes being implemented.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australian Customs Service</field><field name="subject">ACS</field><field name="subject">organisational culture</field><field name="subject">organisational reliability theory</field><field name="subject">organisational turnaround</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060529.172334</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Robust methods in logistic regression</field><field name="creator">Nargis, Suraiya</field><field name="description">My Masters research aims to deepen our understanding of the behaviour of robust
methods in logistic regression. Logistic regression is a special case of Generalized Linear
Modelling (GLM), which is a powerful and popular technique for modelling a large
variety of data. Robust methods are useful in reducing the effect of outlying values in the
response variable on parameter estimates. A literature survey shows that we are still at
the beginning of being able to detect extreme observations in logistic regression analyses,
to apply robust methods in logistic regression and to present informatively the results of
logistic regression analyses.
In Chapter 1 I have made a basic introduction to logistic regression, with an example, and
to robust methods in general.
In Chapters 2 through 4 of the thesis I have described traditional methods and some
relatively new methods for presenting results of logistic regression using powerful
visualization techniques as well as the concepts of outliers in binomial data. I have used
different published data sets for illustration, such as the Prostate Cancer data set, the
Damaged Carrots data set and the Recumbent Cow data set. In Chapter 4 I summarize
and report on the modem concepts of graphical methods, such as central dimension
reduction, and the use of graphics as pioneered by Cook and Weisberg (1999). In Section
4.6 I have then extended the work of Cook and Weisberg to robust logistic regression.
In Chapter 5 I have described simulation studies to investigate the effects of outlying
observations on logistic regression (robust and non-robust). In Section 5.2 I have come to
the conclusion that, in the case of classical or robust multiple logistic regression with no
outliers, robust methods do not necessarily provide more reasonable estimates of the
parameters for the data that contain no st~ong outliers. In Section 5.4 I have looked into
the cases where outliers are present and have come to the conclusion that either the
breakdown method or a sensitivity analysis provides reasonable parameter estimates in
that situation. Finally, I have identified areas for further study.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">logistic regression</field><field name="subject">statistics</field><field name="subject">robust methods</field><field name="subject">Generalized Linear Modelling</field><field name="subject">GLM</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20051111.141200</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The impact of information provided by medical
libraries on clinical decision making :
A study of two hospitals</field><field name="creator">Ali, Irena Malgorzata</field><field name="description">A quantitative survey was conducted in two Canberra hospitals that aimed
at ascertaining the impact of information provided by medical libraries on
clinical decision making. Specifically, this research study investigated
clinical, cognitive and quality value of information provided by the medical
librarians to the management of patients and doctors' ability to handle
clinical cases differently as a result of such information. Furthermore, the
relative value of information received from the library was assessed by
comparing it to the value of information received from other sources in
dealing with clinical problems.
The research involved medical specialists and registrars affiliated with these
hospitals. Doctors were asked to select any clinical situation which they
frequently or currently encounter and for which further information would
be useful to them. Once their information requests were identified, they
were then asked to present such requests to the hospital library. In order to
avoid any special treatment, participants were urged not to identify
themselves to the library staff as partaking in the study. It was important
that participants did not search for the information themselves. The doctors
were asked to evaluate the material provided by the library in relation to
clinical care and, thereafter, complete a short questionnaire. This research
took place between October 1994 and March 1995. The questionnaires were
sent to 288 doctors. This represented the total population of specialists and
registrars affiliated with both hospitals at the time of the study. Analysis of
the results is based on a 34% useable response rate.
Medical specialists were by far the higher number of respondents (70%) as
compared with registrars (30%). Eighty-one per cent of the doctors said that
the information provided by the library refreshed their memory and 82% said
that it would contribute to better quality of medical care. Eighty-six per cent
indicated that some of this information was new to them and 99% said that
the information provided was up to date. Ninety-four per cent said that the
information provided by the library was of clinical value to them.
As the result of the information provided by the library 75% of respondents
would either definitely or probably handle some aspects of the clinical
situation differently than they would have done it otherwise. The level of
importance of the change for the optimal care of patients was assessed with
54% regarding it as important, 42% as moderately important.
Specifically, as the result of the information provided, the doctors were
able to change the following:
diagnosis 10%,
choice of lab tests 20%,
choice of other diagnostic investigations 24%,
choice of drugs 27%,
choice of other management 58%,
reduce length of hospitalisation 10%,
post-operative care of patients 25%,
advice given to patients 47%. On the basis of the received information the doctors were able to avoid
the following:
hospitalisation of patients 11%,
risk of hospital acquired infection 8%,
surgical intervention 19%,
tests or other investigation 23%,
additional out-patient visits 12%. 
Discussions with colleagues were reported to be most valued sources of
information for the purpose of clinical decisions (59%), followed by diagnostic
imaging (49%), librarian (45%), lab tests (42%) and patients' medical records
(30%). The librarian's role as contributing to the process of clinical decisions was
rated highly with 88% ranking it as either important or moderately important.
The results of significance p test statistic performed at 0.05 significance level
suggested that, for this study, there was a significant relationship between the
frequency of library use and doctors' ability to change the choice of laboratory
tests, diagnostic investigations, and the choice of prescribed drugs.
The results of this research study demonstrate that medical librarians can
positively contribute to clinical management of patients by providing timely and
accurate information. Further research is recommended in order to determine
the impact of the whole range of library services on health care outcomes.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">medical libraries</field><field name="subject">medical librarians</field><field name="subject">medical specialists</field><field name="subject">doctors</field><field name="subject">clinical decisions</field><field name="subject">library services</field><field name="subject">health care</field><field name="subject">Woden Valley Hospital</field><field name="subject">Calvary Hospital</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060530.115422</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An analysis of enrolment trends in non-Catholic,
non-Government schools</field><field name="creator">Allen, John R.</field><field name="description">Enrolment trends in non-Catholic, non-Government schools since
1962 show various interesting features. Overall the percentage of
students enrolled in such schools today is about the same as it
was in 1962, but this percentage has fluctuated in the intervening
period. It contrasts notably with the trend in Catholic schools
which is one of a sustained decline.
Further analysis reveals that the number of boarders in non-
Catholic, non-Government schools as a percentage of total
enrolments in such schools has declined markedly, and during this
decade has declined in absolute terms. This fall appears to
relate to declining rural incomes and to rural-urban migration.
The drop occurs despite the fact that increases in boarding fees
are less than increases in tuition fees, the former relating
closely to trends in the consumer price index, the latter to
movements in the gross national product per capita.
The masculinity level for All Schools and for non-Catholic,
non-Government schools is about 1O5 in each case. However, in
All Schools there has been a notable decline to reach this point,
whereas in non-Catholic, non-Government schools there has been
a steady increase in masculinity over the last fifteen years to
arrive at the same point.
Since 1962 Undenominational Schools have increased their enrolments
at a considerably faster rate than have other religions.
Presbyterian schools have lost ground, reflecting, perhaps, their
interest in non metropolitan boarding schools, a sector which has
been adversely affected in recent years, and also, perhaps,
reflecting some inertia resulting from the impending union into
the Uniting Church. In non-Catholic, non-Government schools a ratio of about 2:1
between secondary and primary enrolments seems common. Enrolments
within these two sections seem to be affected by somewhat
different factors, but a balance has been maintained at this level.
Trends noted are not the result of particular variables but of a
large number of interrelated factors. Relationships can be
noted but not causality. Many interesting paths appear, often
paths which cannot be followed in this field study. Nevertheless,
there are various questions which beg further research. For
example, why it is that New South Wales (including the Australian
Capital Territory) with the highest per capita income of any
state has the lowest percentage of school students attending
non-Catholic, non-Government schools?</field><field name="date">1977</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">non-Government schools</field><field name="subject">non-Catholic schools</field><field name="subject">enrolments</field><field name="subject">undenominational schools</field><field name="subject">boarders</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060530.143734</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A computer assisted study of science education in Australian primary schools</field><field name="creator">Allen, L. R.</field><field name="description">It is a well documented fact that primary teachers as a group
are quite lacking in their enthusiasm for science, a subject
of constant concern for those committed to its role as a component
of the primary school curriculum.
In order to test the effects of various treatments on groups of
teachers and pre-service trainees, a 21 item questionnaire was
developed to measure attitudes towards science in the primary
school curriculum, towards improving expertise in the area, and
in the traditional &amp;quotescientific attitudes and values&amp;quote.
A new group of pre-service students provided one group and the
pilot population, students in their final semester of a Diploma in
Teaching programme another group, and teachers attending residential
schools for UG2 conversion and PGl teacher education courses provided
several other groups based on teaching location.
Items were selected from the pilot instrument on their ability
to discriminate between high scoring and low scoring groups
measured with the Mann-Whitney U test.
Analyses in the main survey between groups, were carried out using
Mann-Whitney U test and Kruskal-Wallis one way analysis of variance,

All manipulation and analysis of data was carried out with the

phenomenon, one which impacts on individuals, families, schools and
wider society. A growing body of evidence suggests that individuals'
susceptibility to occupational stress is not determined exclusively by
environmental or personality factors, but by the cognitive and
behavioural transactions between the individual and potentially stressful
events. Two major factors which contribute to individual stress are a
person's appraisal of events as threatening or demanding, and the
strategies they use in coping with those events.
The purpose of this study is to explore the relationship between
experience, stress levels and coping patterns in a group of primary school
teachers. Two groups of teachers were surveyed, 'Starters' who were in
their first year of teaching and 'Stayers' who had at least 10 years of
teaching experience. Stayers were divided, on the basis of their responses,
into Low-stress, Moderate-stress and High-stress groups. The aspects of
coping which were explored are:
1. The range of coping strategies used by teachers in each group,
2. The frequency of use of those coping strategies for each group, and
3. The coping styles preferred by teachers in each group.
The results of this study show no direct connexion between stress
level and any of the demographic variables (sex, age, religion, piety,
teaching experience, full-time teaching, part-time teaching and time away
from teaching). Nor are significant differences found between the coping
patterns of more or less experienced and more or less stress teachers.
A pattern is suggested by correlational analysis, wherein
inexperienced teachers (Starters) and highly-stressed experienced
teachers (High-stress Stayers) show the same preference for coping styles.
It is hypothesized that this similarity of preference relates to role of
control in reducing stress, and that these groups are examples of different
stages of adaptation to teaching. Implications for the use of these
preferences in detecting teacher stress, and for the inclusion of coping
strategies in teacher training are discussed.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">teachers</field><field name="subject">occupational stress</field><field name="subject">coping strategies</field><field name="subject">teacher training</field><field name="subject">Catholic primary schools</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060531.155625</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Take that woman : a creatie writing project</field><field name="creator">Alston, Sylvia</field><field name="description">Take that woman explores social issues as a piece of mainstream fiction.

revolves around realistic characters, in a contemporary setting, facing situations which

the reader; rather it provides information in bite-sized pieces so it can be easily digested.
Take that woman is the story of a group of people brought together by a wedding. Set
in the present, the action takes place in Canberra on a day in early November. The story
moves between Australia and England, between the present and the past as it examines
the conflicts the day generates for the couple's families and friends.
Not only does the wedding serve as a device to bring the characters together, it also
highlights the seriousness of the issues being explored.
The account is a fictional piece as fiction can be an effective communication tool.
Information is disseminated in different forms through a variety of media, both

to grain farmers</field><field name="creator">Annis, Margaret Catherine</field><field name="description">This thesis is concerned with an investigation into current on-farm grain storage
practice and with ascertaining what educational interventions, if any, are appropriate
for future and more detailed consideration. The Australian grain growing, handling,
and marketing industry has changed in recent times. A few years ago (1989), the grain
growers only essential contact with grain marketing was through the bulk handling
authorities and the Australian Wheat Board. Advice was freely available from state
departments of agriculture, and the only requirement to store grain on-farm was that
necessary for the grower's own needs.
Now (1994), there is a possible advantage that grain stored on-farm may be used for a
wide range of selling options, amongst other reasons, and market requirements are
much more complex and stringent. There is a substantial body of research on grain
storage techniques. At the same time there is a significant gap between researched
knowledge and the use of this knowledge for on-farm storage. A major purpose of this
study is to identify an improved approach to extension and farmer education that may
help to reduce this gap.
This thesis contains a review of the general literature on extension followed by an
overview of extension in the developed world to establish the international context for
Australia. Then the historical context of extension is examined briefly to understand
the current situation in each state. Some educational models are reviewed to identify
relationships between stakeholders and the opportunities available for and constraints
to development of educational strategies. Information channels are reviewed to
comprehend extension interaction and grain storage technologies are reviewed to
ensure comprehension of techniques.
On the basis of the literature review a field study was designed to investigate current
on-farm storage practice, current extension sources for storage information and
preferences for future educational interventions. This was done by a survey using a
stratified random sample of grain growers and cluster selection of individuals for
personal interviews. This information was complemented by informal discussion with
farmers at field days.
The results of the study confirmed the gap between research knowledge and on-farm
implementation of this knowledge. They also demonstrated that grain growers wanted
more information and gave some indicators of how this might be achieved. Major
findings of the research included the need for extension coalitions and the desirability
for active involvement of the grain grower.
Major conclusions, for on-farm storage and extension, are drawn to form a basis for
development of future extension interventions. These are aimed at ensuring grain
growers have available the information needed for good storage practice. This includes
an essential understanding the grain growers' needs and perceptions, early, in any
planning process. It also includes the necessity for coordination of extension/education
activities at local, regional and national levels.
The research has some major implications for an improved approach to extension and
on-farm storage. These include the establishment of a farmers-as-researcher program to
implement grain storage innovations and the recognition that implemented change will
need long term maintenance; often more resource intensive than the original
intervention.</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">grain storage</field><field name="subject">grain industry</field><field name="subject">farmer education</field><field name="subject">research and development</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060602.115607</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Crisis news and the environmental question in
western media reporting on Afrlca, 1982-87 :
a case study of the Ethiopian famine</field><field name="creator">Ansah, Kofi Boafo Adu</field><field name="description">Coverage of the Third World by the media in the developed Western
nations has been a subject of intense debate among scholars since the 1970s.
Some of the outspoken media critics have pointed to certain imbalances in
Western media reporting on some parts of the world, including African
countries. Such imbalances range from inadequate coverage to emphasis on
crisis news events. Other critics argue, however, that Western news
reporting on African countries, for example, is crisis-oriented because that is
the kind of news those countries offer to the media given the recurrence of
various forms of crises there.
The 1984-85 Ethiopian famine was one such crisis that received extensive
coverage in the Western media. Criticisms of this coverage served to fuel a
growing concern among African and other intellectuals, particularly about
one aspect of Western media reporting: the failure of those media to put into
adequate context African events on which they report. Some critics have
pointed out, for example, that although environmental decline is a major
underlying cause of famine in Africa, it does not receive attention in
Western media coverage of this recurring crisis. This is in spite of the
pioneering role of the latter in the promotion of environmental issues in
the West as a major social and political concern.
From a much broader perspective, however, it appears that the case of
imbalanced reporting on Africa in the Western media is not an isolated one.
A number of studies on news reporting suggests that the criticism of
imbalances in Western news reporting may have more to do with the
nature of Western news values than with a wilful attempt on the part of the
Western media to report on particular countries in those terms. Thus
reporting on African countries by the Western media could be one typical
example in which standard Western news practices come into full play.
Against this background, the present study sought to investigate Western
media coverage of Africa as viewed in terms of the application of Western
news values. First, using qualitative analyses of relevant literature, the study
undertook a contextualisation of crisis events in African countries, with
special reference to famines, by identifying environmental degradation as a
crucial factor in the unfolding of such crises. This included explanations for
the apparent neglect of African environmental issues by Western media.
Discussion on the environment was set in a wider context of a global
environmental crisis. The qualitative analyses also examined the issue of
imbalances, such as the focus on crisis and the lack of context, in Western
media coverage of Africa. This was explored within a theoretical framework
that encapsulates aspects of the political economy of the mass media,
political ideological differences, and culture as some of the theoretical
propositions used by some media researchers to explain imbalances in
international news flow. Second, the study used the quantitative research
technique of content analysis to carry out a longitudinal investigation of
reporting on African countries in general during 1982-87 as well as a case
study of the 1984-85 Ethiopian famine by three Western dailies: The Times of
London, the New York Times, and the Sydney Morning Herald. An IAMCR
(International Association for Mass Communication Research) coding
scheme was adopted for this purpose.
With regard to the qualitative analyses, the study found that even though
environmental decline is a major underlying cause of many of Africa's
ongoing and recurring crises such as famines, it may not receive attention in
Western media reporting on those crises. This appears to be because the
nature of Africa's environmental problems does not meet Western news
value criteria. As regards the content analyses, the study found, in both the
longitudinal and case studies, a dearth of reporting in all three dailies on
African environmental issues and an orientation towards reporting events
as discrete events, with little or no attention to underlying or contextual
information. Crisis and non-crisis events in Africa were found to be,
however, equally reported in most of the sample years studied in two of the
three dailies. The focus of reporting on the Ethiopian famine was found to
be on Western relief activities and on the bizarre or sensational side of the
disaster - aspects of reporting that fit into standard Western news practices.</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">news reporting</field><field name="subject">Africa</field><field name="subject">Ethiopia</field><field name="subject">famine</field><field name="subject">environmental issues</field><field name="subject">western media</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060602.122503</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A lexical cartography of twentieth century Australia</field><field name="creator">Arthur, Jillian Mary</field><field name="description">This thesis looks at the relation between the English language and the Australian place.

state: Pakistan</field><field name="creator">Adeel, Liaqat</field><field name="description">During the last one year, while working on this thesis, I have been asked several times as to how
Islam or Islamic fundamentalism makes a communication thesis. The answer is simple: my
concern is not Islam as a religion or fundamentalism as a religious or political movement but the
way Islam is defined and fundamentalism presented. In the age of communication reality is not just
what we see or sense but what we are shown and made to perceive. It would be no exaggeration to
suggest that today our dependence on the communication networks is such that even for something
that happens in front of us we need interpretations to fully comprehend it. Thus reality without
interpretations, in most cases, has come to carry little meaning. Our perception of reality today is
not based on our individual experiences only. It is, in fact, the sum total of the reality plus
interpretations by the 'public arenas' such as education institutions, mass media, the civil service,
parliament, the courts, industry, the research and scientific community, political parties etc.
(Cracknell, 1993: 4).
This study deals with the interpretations of Islam and Islamic fundamentalism by the Muslim as
well as western public arenas. Throughout this thesis I use the word 'Islam' not as a religion but as
a symbol of political power and cultural identity. Because, I believe that Islam as a faith is a
personal and spiritual matter that for majority of the Muslims, like the believers of any religion,
need not be compared with any other religion unless to prove it superior. But as a symbol of
political power and cultural identity Islam does need interpretations and has been interpreted in
many different ways. What triggered my interest in yet another interpretation was that what I had
seen in Pakistan and what I felt the West thought of Muslim societies had no logical connection.
For instance, there is a widespread belief in the West that Muslim societies are deeply religious and
Islam guides every aspect of the Muslims' life. The reality that I have seen and experienced in
Pakistan society, which is ninety-six per cent Muslim, is that few, very few indeed, Muslims may
be willing to die or kill for Islam, but will not live according to Islam. The people of Pakistan, in
their day-to-day life, are as secular as the people of any other part of the world. They have all
human virtues and vices that human beings are capable of anywhere in the world. But still there is
no denying the fact that Pakistan, or for that matter any underdeveloped society, is different from
the industrialised West. How and why are they different is what I have investigated in this thesis.
I have no hesitation in admitting that except for the discrepancy in the reality that I had seen in
Pakistan and its perception that I noticed in the West, I had no clear idea about the subject. But I
have always believed, as Sartre has said somewhere, that the honourable thing about reading is to
let yourself be influenced. I claim to have started this thesis with an open mind, but I do not claim
to be an objective writer, unless objectivity is seen as nothing but to be honest to one's self as well
as others. All of us live with our subjectivity that is influenced by our individual and collective
objective conditions. Most of us are content to live with what we have learnt during our formative
phase in life. Some of us are not. I belong to the latter tribe. Through the years I have unlearnt
many a thing about religion, culture and human beings that I had learnt from my family, school and
society, to accommodate more ideas, opinions and concepts, not less. That process still continues.
One thing that I have learnt in life, and which I shall cherish forever, is that human beings must not
be frozen in their cultural, religious and social categories; they must not be seen as good and bad

the impact on communities
and the dynamics of conflict</field><field name="creator">Baker, Keith</field><field name="description">The research undertaken compares the impact of heritage planning and management at
Maldon in Victoria, with Tumbarumba in New South Wales and to a lesser extent with
a number of other municipalities. Maldon and Tumbarumba are former gold mining
towns of similar size and age. Maldon has been subject to rigorous planning controls
following its declaration as a 'Notable Town' by the National Trust of Australia
(Victoria) in the 1960s and was the forerunner for heritage planning in Australia, while
Tumbarumba was later to be recognised for its heritage value and has less detailed
planning controls. Maldon has been the centre of ongoing conflict for decades while
Tumbarumba has been relatively free of conflict.
Through research into existing documents, community consultation and use of
questionnaires, this thesis sets out to look at how the conservation of heritage towns fits
into the broader picture of conservation management, and examines the dynamics of
conserving heritage towns. By undertaking a heritage study in the town of
Tumbarumba, and looking closely at how heritage planning was implemented at
Maldon, two dimensions of heritage management are examined. Firstly, the
consistency in the planning process and the duration of events are compared, and
secondly the extent of conflict is examined with contributing factors being isolated.
Within the thesis, models are developed for analysing the conflict at Maldon, and for
implementing heritage management in towns. The latter is through examining the
accepted approaches to heritage management against the evidence of conflict, external
control, community involvement and the presence of incentives. The thesis concludes
that the dynamics of working with the community can be as important as the technical
aspects of conservation.</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">heritage management</field><field name="subject">Maldon</field><field name="subject">Tumbarumba</field><field name="subject">conservation</field><field name="subject">community involvement</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060605.150819</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The myth of maladjustment : the identification and facilitation of personality and attitudinal characteristics in creative individuals</field><field name="creator">Balgir, Helen Singh</field><field name="description">Such personality idiosyncrasies of creative persons
as a preference for disorder and complexity rather than
neatness and simplicity may erroneously have earned them
the nomenclature of maladjusted, emotionally unstable
and eccentric.
This field study explores the conventional approach
to the evaluation of creative behaviour and suggests
that there is an urgent need to revolutionise our
acceptance and encouragement of such behaviour in an
integrated social and educational sense.
Chapter 1 reviews various definitions of creativity
and in particular the sociological discrimination against
creativity in contemporary society. The notion of the
relativity of the predominant social, educational and
psychological research perspective is raised.
The confusion in meaning which the terms &amp;quotegiftedness&amp;quote,
&amp;quotegenius&amp;quote and &amp;quotecreativity&amp;quote evoke in the context of classical
research efforts is discussed in Chapter 2.
Chapter 3 reviews traditional psychoanalytic,
psychiatric and psychometric research into creativity.
Orthodox methodology which fragments the total human
individual, is seen as detrimental to understanding,
accepting and facilitating research into creativity. It
has only been where total personality has been considered,
that research has proved meaningful.
Chapter 4 attempts to correlate the theoretical
viewpoints of various authors on creativity, in
particular Jung, Barron, Maslow, Assagioli and Hudson.
The empirical chapter 5 is divided into four sections.
Section I explores teacher attitudes towards creative
personality characteristics using Torrance's Ideal
Pupil Checklist. The results of the sample of A.C.T.
teachers surveyed,correspond closely with those found by
Torrance in five other countries, although creativity is
markedly less encouraged in Australia than in the United
States. Section II explores the attitudes of a sample
of Year 10 A.C.T. high school students towards creative
personality characteristics. Results show an alarmingly
low correlation with expert rankings. Section III compares
the teachers' and students' responses on the checklist
and finds interesting discrepancies. Section IV is
concerned with identifying &amp;quotecreativity&amp;quote in students using
a number of instruments, in particular the Myer-Briggs
Type Indicator. Additionally, results on this instrument
are compared with WL/WQ results and career preferences,
where few trends emerged.
Chapter 6 restates the necessity of adopting a total
personality perspective when considering creativity. The
&amp;quotepsychosynthesis&amp;quote model is suggested as fundamentalising
and facilitating creative growth personally, educationally
and socially. Futuristic aspects of evolution and
creativity are raised. Wholeness as opposed to
separatism and synthesis as opposed to fragmentation are
considered paramount contemporary psychological issues,
as exemplified by the &amp;quotesoul searching&amp;quote associated with
the drug culture. The need to achieve growth and
balance between the different, diverse and complementary,
aspects of the psyche, both in individuals and in society
is seen as being paramount and of increasing sociological
relevance.</field><field name="date">1978</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">creativity</field><field name="subject">personality</field><field name="subject">Jung</field><field name="subject">Barron</field><field name="subject">Maslow</field><field name="subject">Assagioli</field><field name="subject">Hudson</field><field name="subject">Torrance's Ideal</field><field name="subject">Myer-Briggs</field><field name="subject">teachers</field><field name="subject">high school students</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060606.153314</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Print media and the development of an Australian
culture of food and eating c. 1850 to c. 1920 :
the evidence from newspapers, periodical journals and cookery literature</field><field name="creator">Bannerman, Colin</field><field name="description">Chapter 1 considers culture as a product of communication. The central problem
is to understand how an array of influencing factors such as food supply, technology
and physical and intellectual environment are represented, stored and shared as 'food
culture'. It considers mechanisms by which culture might be transmitted from one
location to another including the relevance of historical literature and Louis Hartz's
notion of Australia as a 'cultural fragment' cast off from the Old World. Chapter 2
shows that the Australian literature represents a discourse in which information about
various aspects of feeding was gathered from local and overseas sources and circulated
for instruction, entertainment and use. The discourse and the means of conducting it
were products of their age. Public participation was evident in the correspondence
columns of weekly newspapers and in 'contributory' cookery books. The discourse
drew on various themes that were prominent in other Western discourses and reflected
social and moral values of the times. It evidenced beliefs that the manner of a society's
feeding demonstrates the extent of its' civilisation and that refinement of food and
feeding contributes to the improvement of society. It also reflected nationalist sentiment
and demonstrated some attempts to develop a distinctive Australian cuisine. Chapter 3
supports these claims with detailed analysis of recipes published in a sample of journals
and cookery books. Chapter 4 describes five instances which illustrate in more depth the
influence of print media in culture development. The first two show deliberate use of
print media to reform cookery practice. The third shows the role of print in cookery
education, suggesting an alternative mechanism by which cookery in Australia retained
its British character. The fourth tests the idea that the transmission of food and science
cultural influences from the Old World to the New followed broadly similar paths and
questions the origins of the domestic science movement. The fifth examines commercial
influences exerted through print media and notes that food production, processing and
distribution enterprise was to become increasingly influential as Australia (and other
countries) turned to industrial feeding. The thesis concludes with some reflections on
the processes of culture formation and the role of mass communications. It suggests that
food culture is both an expression of conceptions of character and identity and a
formative influence on them, that the engine of cultural change has been industrial
progress and, finally, that the communication system which supports and enriches food
culture may also tend to undermine it.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">food culture</field><field name="subject">Australian literature</field><field name="subject">discourse analysis</field><field name="subject">print media</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060606.155602</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Movement patterns and prey habits of house cats felis catus (l.) in Canberra, Australia</field><field name="creator">Barratt, David</field><field name="description">House cat movements in Canberra suburbs adjacent to grassland and forest/woodland
areas were examined using radio-telemetry over 9 months. Information on the
composition of vertebrate prey caught by house cats in Canberra was also collected by
recording prey items deposited at cat owners' residences over 12 months.
Home range areas of 10 suburban house cats, and a colony of seven farm cats, were
examined using 95% convex polygons. Nocturnal home range areas of the suburban
cats varied between 0.02 and 27.93 ha (mean 7.89 ha), and were larger than diurnal
home range areas (range 0.02 to 17.19 ha - mean 2.73 ha). Nocturnal home range areas
of cats from the farm cat colony varied between 1.38 and 4.46 ha (mean 2.54 ha), and
were also larger than diurnal home range areas (range 0.77 to 3.70 ha - mean 1.70 ha).
Activity levels were greater at night than during the day, though diel activity patterns
varied seasonally in response to ambient temperature. Four suburban house cats moved
between 390 m and 900 m into habitat adjoining the suburb. Movements further than
100-200 m from the suburb edge were always made at night. Polygons describing the
home ranges of these animals were strongly spatially biased away from the suburban
environment, though the cats spent the majority of their time within the bounds of the
suburb.
In addition to nocturnal and diurnal effects, home range areas, and subsequently habitat
utilisation, appeared primarily determined by the density and spatial distribution of cats
utilising separate food resources, and the dominance of individual cats in local social
hierarchies, rather than gender or neutering effects. Home ranges of cats in the farm cat
colony overlapped extensively, as did those of cats living at the same suburban
residence. There was little or no overlap between the home ranges of cats from different
residences. Barriers, in the form of busy roads, appeared to also significantly influence
home range size and shape.
Within home range areas, house cat movements during the day appeared strongly
influenced by available cover (drains, tall grass, fences and shrubs etc.), and the location
of resting/sunning spots and hunting sites close to home. At night, movement patterns
appeared influenced by the location of favoured hunting sites toward the outer edges of
home range areas (in this study, tall grass and scrub/forest habitat, and farm buildings).
Nineteen hundred and sixty one prey items representing 67 species were reported or
collected. Sixty-four percent of the prey items were introduced mammals, with native
birds comprising 14%, introduced birds 10%, unidentified birds 3%, reptiles 7%,
amphibians 1% and native mammals 1%. Predation appeared to be largely
opportunistic with respect to spatial and temporal (daily and seasonal) prey availability
and accessibility. All amphibians and 62% of mammals taken by cats not confined at
night, were caught at night. In contrast, 70% of birds caught, and 90% of reptiles, were
taken during the day (45% of birds between 0600 h and 1200 h, and 61% of reptiles
between 1200 h and 1800 h). There was some evidence that small mammals are
preferred prey of house cats.
The mean number of prey items reported per cat over 12 months - 10.2 &#65533; 2.66 (2SE,
n=138) - was significantly lower than mean predation per cat per year - 23.3 &#65533; 6.16
(2SE, n=138) - estimated by cat owners before the prey survey began. Seventy percent
of cats were observed to catch less than 10 prey items over 12 months, but for 6% of
cats, more than 50 prey items were recorded. Because counts of the amount of prey
caught per house cat per unit time were highly positively skewed, data assumptions and
statistical parameters used to extrapolate results from the study sample of cats, to the
house cat population of Canberra, had a significant effect on estimates of total predation
in Canberra. The precision of the total predation estimate was low (&#177; 25%), from a
sample of 0.3% of the Canberra house cat population. The accuracy of such estimates
are dependent on how representative the study cat sample is of the wider house cat
population, and on the proportion of prey items not observed by cat owners.
The total amount of prey taken was not significantly influenced by cat gender, age when
desexed, or cat breed. Nor did belling or the number of meals provided per day have a
significant influence on predatory efficiency. Cat age and the proportion of nights spent
outside explained approximately 11 % of the variation in the amount of prey caught by
individual cats. House cat density and distance to prey source areas (rural/grassland
habitat) explained 43% of variation in predation on introduced mammals and birds.
The impact of predation beyond suburb edges is likely to be most significant on
populations of small to medium sized arboreal and ground-dwelling mammals, because
of their nocturnal nature, and because they appear to be preferred prey types of house
cats. Impacts on diurnally active prey, such as most birds and reptiles, are likely to be
confined to within 200 m of residential housing (possibly further where good cover is
available). Properly enforced nocturnal confinement should restrict the range sizes of
cats that roam widely and utilisation of habitat beyond suburb edges, and also reduce
predation on mammals and amphibians. Night-time curfews however, are unlikely to
greatly reduce predation on diurnally active species, including most birds and reptiles.
Curfews are currently neither widely adopted nor effectively practiced in Canberra.
Estimates of predation by house cats, particularly extrapolated estimates, should be
treated with caution. They do not necessarily reflect relative impacts on different prey
types. Nor do high rates of predation prove prey populations are detrimentally effected,
particularly in urban environments. Nonetheless, on a small (backyard) scale in
suburban environments, and in habitat within 1 km of residential housing, including
isolated private properties, predation by individual cats may threaten populations of
native wildlife. Hunting by house cats is particularly undesirable in relatively
undisturbed habitat because of fundamental differences in the ecological processes
operating in these areas (especially isolated remnants) compared with contrived and
modified suburban environments. Adverse impacts on native fauna will always be
potentially greatest in undisturbed habitat adjacent to new residential developments</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">house cats</field><field name="subject">Canberra</field><field name="subject">habitat</field><field name="subject">radio-telemetry</field><field name="subject">prey</field><field name="subject">curfews</field><field name="subject">native wildlife</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060607.160345</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Office Copying 1950-1970 : thermographic processes, their deterioration and preservation</field><field name="creator">Batterham, Ian</field><field name="description">This work looks at a range of copying processes used between 1950 and 1970 and which

a critical analysis of discourse, purpose and
practice with regard to women and new
communication technologies</field><field name="creator">Beckenham, Annabel</field><field name="description">New information and communication technologies have excited considerable
popular and expert attention over the last decades of the twentieth century.
Predictions about their social effects range along a continuum from visions of
heaven; where people slip the surly bonds of time and space, to glimpses of hell;
where such slippage enables new manifestations of dominance and control. Along
the continuum there is a basic determinist premise evident, that the technologies
have developed in a marginal sphere, and will now bring a new way of life, or at
least provide materials for a new way of life, whether this be for good or evil. The
notion of cyberspace as a new communicative domain has in particular engaged
this kind of attention.
This thesis is concerned with the ways in which the rhetoric of cyberspace sheds
light on deeper social preoccupations and relations. It is an attempt to move
beyond discussion of particular technologies and their possible effects to examine
the ways in which habitual social intercourse is reconstructed in and around
cyberspace. As a feminist scholar of communication I am particularly interested
in the ways in which existing gender relations are maintained in discursive
constructions of women in cyberspace, and the ways in which feminist theorists
may respond to the new domain.
Because I seek to elude simple determinism, I have sought to contextualise the
space by some focus on the known social needs, purposes and practices to which
the development of cyberspace technologies has been central. Although I
acknowledge the power of discourse to maintain extant social relations, I seek to
elude discursive determinism by some focus on the ways in which women have
creatively appropriated new technologies; on the disjunctions of discourse and
practice.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Internet</field><field name="subject">cyberspace</field><field name="subject">social impacts</field><field name="subject">gender relations</field><field name="subject">women in cyberspace</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060607.173021</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Policy markets in Australia</field><field name="creator">Ayres, Russell</field><field name="description">Are there policy markets in Australia, and if so, how do they operate? This is the core question for this dissertation. Beginning with a focus on this simple formulation of the problem, the thesis explores the idea of policy markets, breaking it down into its constituent parts&#65533;&#65533;policy&#65533; and &#65533;markets&#65533;&#65533;and develops four different ways in which policy markets (i.e. markets for policy analysis, research and advice) might be modeled: 1. the dimensions of knowledge, values and competition in policy development systems and processes; 2. a hierarchy of policy markets according to strategic, programmatic and operational concerns; 3. policy markets in the context of cyclical process models of policy-making, especially the variant posited by Bridgman and Davis (1998); and 4. a typology of policy markets ranging from &#65533;pseudo&#65533; forms through to a form of full (or &#65533;pure&#65533;) policy market. Against the background of this theory-building, the empirical evidence&#65533;which was gathered through a combination of documentary investigation and some 77 interviews with senior public servants, consultants and ministers&#65533;is addressed through three interrelated approaches: an analysis of the (relatively limited) government-wide data; a comparison of this material with experience in New Zealand; and a set of three extended case studies. The three case studies address the idea and experience of policy markets from the point of view of: &#65533; the supplier&#65533;in this case, the economic forecasting and analysis firm, Access Economics; &#65533; ministers-as-buyers&#65533;through a study of the Coalition Government&#65533;s 1998 efforts to reform the waterfront; and &#65533; the bureaucracy as implementers of an extensive program of outsourcing&#65533;through a detailed examination of the outsourcing of corporate services (especially human resource management) by the Department of Finance and Administration. Several conclusions are drawn as to the character, extent and theoretical and practical significance of policy markets in Australia. While various elements of actual markets (e.g. contracts, price and service competition, multiple sources of supply, etc.) can be detected in the Australian approach to
policy-making, policy markets are not as prevalent or as consistent as the rhetoric might suggest. In particular, while the language of the market is a common feature throughout the Australian policy-making system, it tends to mask a complex, &#65533;mixed economy&#65533;, whereby there is a continued preference for many of the mechanisms of bureaucratic ways of organising for policy analysis, combined with a growing challenge from various forms of networks, which are sometimes &#65533;dressed&#65533; as markets but retain the essential elements of policy (or, perhaps more particularly, political) networks. Nevertheless, the growing use of the language and some of the forms of the market in Australia&#65533;s policy-making system suggests that practitioners and researchers need to take this form into account when considering ways of organising (in the case of practitioners) or ways of studying (for researchers) policy development in Australia.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">policy markets</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">policy development</field><field name="subject">marketisation</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20050418.124214</field></doc><doc><field name="title">ACT infromation technology and adult education : a case study of the extent to which adult learning principles are incorporated into information technology adult education and training in the Australian Capital Territory</field><field name="creator">Bosworth, Kendra</field><field name="description">This study explores the implementation of adult learning principles in information

explored in order to determine the changes in perspectives since 1900. Five of
Canberra's information technology adult education and training providers were
analysed. Surveys were distributed to trainers and students of these providers. These
surveys requested respondents to rate their perception of the extent to which each
learning principle is adopted in their learning environment. Demographic information

sediments based on steam distillation and aqueous phase ethylation followed by gas chromatography-atomic fluorescence spectrometry. The methods were shown to be free
from measurable artefactual methylation of inorganic mercury and offered improved
sample throughput over existing methods. Improvements were made to existing
methods for the determination of total mercury in biota, sediments and natural waters
and dissolved mercury species in natural waters. These methods were applied to the
study of mercury cycling in two remote field sites.
The cycling of mercury species was studied in Lake Murray in Western Province,
Papua New Guinea, which has been historically noted as a region of high mercury
concentrations in fish. Concentrations of methylmercury and total mercury in the water
column were found to be variable and consistent with non-contaminated lake systems.
Concentrations of methylmercury and total mercury in the sediments were also found to
be low, except for in the south of the lake, which was influenced by an intermittent
supply of water and sediments with elevated mercury concentrations from the
Strickland River. Methylmercury concentrations in the sediments were generally higher
in the backwater areas due to littoral processes. The low concentrations of
methylmercury in the sediments and waters were inconsistent with other systems
previously studied in the northern hemisphere, showing a link between high mercury
concentrations in fish and high concentrations of methylmercury in waters or sediments.
Therefore, the biota of Lake Murray were studied in order to account for the differences
between this and other systems.
A study was conducted of the stable isotope ratios of carbon and nitrogen in biota from
Lake Murray to elucidate key food-web interactions. This study revealed that the
dominant carbon source for fish in the lake is plankton, although algae and macrophytes
may also be involved in the food-web. The methylmercury bioaccumulation factors
between trophic levels were similar to those measured in temperate systems of the
northern hemisphere. The high concentrations of methylmercury, observed in
piscivorous fish, were shown to be a consequence of the complex food-web and the
number of trophic levels in the food-chains.
The cycling of mercury species was studied in Lake Gordon and Lake Pedder in
southwest Tasmania, which has recently been identified as being in a region of high
mercury concentrations in trout and eels. The concentrations of total mercury were
found to be reasonably uniform in the waters of both lakes, spatially and temporally.
The concentrations of methylmercury in the waters were seasonally variable, and were
consistently lower in Lake Pedder than in Lake Gordon. Dilution of methylmercury
concentrations by precipitation direct to the lake surface, probably accounts for the
most of the difference in methylmercury concentrations between the lakes. Owing to
the long residence time of water in Lake Gordon, this reservoir mixes inputs of water
with varying methylmercury concentrations. Concentrations of total mercury and
methylmercury in submerged soils were low and depth profiles of mercury species in
the water column did not show evidence of a gradient of mercury concentrations due to
releases from the sediments. The concentrations of methylmercury observed in the
water column are consistent with the concentrations observed in the fish.
A budget of the mercury inputs and outputs to Lake Gordon showed that in-lake
processes and sources in the catchment areas both contributed significantly to the
concentrations of methylmercury in the lake. The methylation of mercury in Lake
Gordon appeared to mainly occur in the surface waters (&lt; 10 m) and was not consistent
with processes leading to the methylation of mercury at the oxic/anoxic boundary
observed in seepage lakes in Wisconsin. The concentrations of total mercury and
methylmercury in bogs in the catchment areas of Lakes Gordon and Pedder, were high
and governed by the concentration of organic matter in the sediments. The processes
involved in the supply of mercury species from the Lake Gordon and Lake Pedder
catchments appear to be similar to those in drainage lakes in the temperate and boreal
regions of the northern hemisphere. The formation of the Lake Gordon and Lake
Pedder reservoirs appears to have had little impact on the mean annual concentrations
of methylmercury released to the downstream environment.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">methylmercury</field><field name="subject">mercury</field><field name="subject">aquatic systems</field><field name="subject">Papua New Guinea</field><field name="subject">Lake Murray</field><field name="subject">Tasmania</field><field name="subject">Lake Pedder</field><field name="subject">Australasia</field><field name="subject">gas chromatography-atomic fluorescence spectrometry</field><field name="subject">steam distillation</field><field name="subject">aqueous phase ethylation</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060609.144839</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Principals' perceptions of school based management in Australian Capital Territory government schools</field><field name="creator">Boyle, Maureen</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates the views of principals in government schools in the Australian
Capital Territory (ACT) regarding school based management (SBM). School based
management is defined as the delegation of certain decision making functions from
central bureaucratic control to a group of personnel located at the school site. In the
case of the ACT, delegation of decision making to school sites began in 1974. An
additional set of responsibilities was delegated in the 1997/98 period. This study
concentrates on the latter period but also takes the extended period of devolution into
account.
This investigation is based on qualitative and quantitative methods of enquiry and data
collection to investigate principals' perceptions of SBM, particularly in relation to the
demographic variables of the schools, and selected personal and professional
characteristics of the principals. Initially twenty six semi-structured interviews were
conducted with principals to determine a framework of seven constructs in relation to
SBM. Qualitative data are reported by drawing on the extensive unabridged transcripts
of the interviews. The data arising from the interview stage formed the basis for
construction of a questionnaire administered to the total population of ninety seven
principals in government schools in the ACT. The questionnaire consists of
demographic, personal and professional items concerning the school and the principal,
items related to the impact of SBM, questions regarding the principals' perceptions of
satisfaction with their work, and the importance principals place on selected aspects of
their role, particularly following the extension of SBM.
Results of the questionnaire are reported using frequency distribution for each of the
items in the questionnaire, followed by factor analysis and analysis of variance to test
significant differences in the principals' views at the 0.05 or greater level. Results of
these analyses show that principals have common perceptions in general about the
nature and impact of SBM. Principals' perceptions are however, mediated by a
number of independent variables. These are gender of the principal, experience of
more than one year's work outside the field of education, the sector of their school, ie
primary, high school or college, and the geographic location of the school. Their
participation in SBM training programs, bureaucratic support to assist them in
implementing SBM, and their expressed need for continued professional development
are additional independent variables where statistically significant differences are
apparent.
Principals in this study view the extension of SBM responsibilities more as an
administrative function, than an opportunity to engage in restructuring the school.
They see that their role has expanded to place strong emphasis on business
management and they consider that they are now working in a market oriented climate
where competition for students is a real issue. Hours of work have increased, and
maintenance of a balance between work and personal life is a growing concern.
Despite this they do not want to return to the former arrangements and continue to
express satisfaction with the intrinsic rewards of their profession such as contact with
students, colleagues and the community.
These results provide important insights into the type of SBM evident in ACT
government schools at the time of this study. A number of recommendations for future
research and practice are presented related to the findings and linked to the key themes
arising in the literature.These suggest ways that SBM can and might be used as a
catalyst for development of a new paradigm for education, which will meet the needs
of a 'knowledge society' (Drucker, 1995) and engage schools in moving 'beyond the
self managing school', (Caldwell and Spinks, 1998).</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">governments schools</field><field name="subject">principals</field><field name="subject">school based management</field><field name="subject">Australian Capital Territory</field><field name="subject">ACT</field><field name="subject">school administration</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060609.152858</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of teacher satisfaction with work and working conditions in government primary schools in the Australian Capital Territory</field><field name="creator">Boyle, Maureen B.</field><field name="description">This study is concerned with the satisfactions
and dissatisfactions that primary teachers in the Australian
Capital Territory experience in their working lives. Its
aim is to identify those aspects of satisfaction and/or
dissatisfaction by considering relationships between the
independent variables.
A modified form of Holdaway's Satisfaction with
Teaching and Employment Conditions Questionnaire was
administered to three hundred and seventy-five teachers.
The Likert-type scale and open responses produced data
which was analysed in relation to personal variables.
Factor analysis was used to determine clustering
of items and to investigate relationships between the
variables. A number of hypotheses were tested to ascertain
the areas of satisfaction and dissatisfaction.
The findings indicate that teacher satisfaction is
linked with intrinsic aspects of their work such as
relationships with students, advancement and personal
growth. Teachers are most dissatisfied with those aspects
of their lives over which they have little control and see
the present attitudes of society towards their function
and role as an area of serious concern.
Statistically significant differences in satisfaction
were found between open-space and traditional
schools, large and smaller schools, men and women teachers,
VII
and between teachers working in upper and lower primary
classes. The relative distribution of resources between
primary and secondary schools is a source of dissatisfaction
and the lack of parity in working conditions highlights
this inequity.
Teacher stress is discussed as an area of growing
concern in the ACT and some links with the system's degree
of autonomy and community involvement are suggested.</field><field name="date">1983</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">primary school teachers</field><field name="subject">job satisfaction</field><field name="subject">Australian Capital Territory</field><field name="subject">ACT</field><field name="subject">Holdaway's Satisfaction with Teaching and Employment Conditions Questionnaire</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060609.154420</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Saving Alicia</field><field name="creator">Bridgewater, Gillian</field><field name="description">Saving Alicia is a creative thesis written to explore the possibility of
incorporating some non-fictional concepts of neurophysiology into a work of
fiction. The initial component presents the historical and contemporary
context in which such a work is written along with an analysis of the writing
techniques employed by other writers in the field. It sets out the aim of the
subsequent creative composition.
The second, and major, component of this thesis is a work of fiction. A story
is developed in which the protagonist, a young woman, revives her deceased
mother's neurophysiological research work in the hope that it will help her
brain-damaged niece, Alicia, recover. For this she is dependent on two men
who were her mother's colleagues. As they compete for her attention, while
pursuing their own conflicting goals, the protagonist maintains her
determination to keep her mother's work going. She has no prior knowledge
of neurophysiology and, so that she can understand the research, she is keen
to learn some of its basic concepts.
Woven through the story of Saving Alicia are descriptions of neurons and their
physiology. This is presented to the protagonist through the mouths of the
two researchers. In this way, the non-fiction is interspersed with the fiction.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">fiction</field><field name="subject">neurophysiology</field><field name="subject">creative composition</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060609.155229</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Gender role orientation, stress, coping and hopelessness in a normal adolescent population</field><field name="creator">Bromhead, David</field><field name="description">Many risk factors have been put forward to account for the significant increase in
adolescent male suicide over the last 20 years, and the pronounced sex difference in
suicide statistics. In particular, hopelessness has been shown to be a strong indicator
of suicidality. This study investigated the relationship of gender role, stress, and
coping to hopelessness in a normal adolescent population. It was hypothesized that
stress, coping and a masculine gender role would contribute to hopelessness. 288
adolescent students between the ages of 15 and 18 were surveyed using the
Adolescent Stress Scale, the Beck Hopelessness Scale, the Australian Sex Role Scale, and the Adolescent Coping Scale. Contrary to expectation, having a masculine gender
role was not related to hopelessness; students with an undifferentiated gender role had
higher levels of hopelessness than androgynous, masculine, and feminine students.
However, the majority of students who had an undifferentiated gender role were male.
Hopelessness was also associated with high levels of stress and the use of avoidance
coping strategies. The results are discussed within the transactional stress model and
the stress-diathesis model.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">suicide</field><field name="subject">male youth</field><field name="subject">coping</field><field name="subject">hopelessness</field><field name="subject">adolescence</field><field name="subject">stress</field><field name="subject">Adolescent Stress Scale</field><field name="subject">Beck Hopelessness Scale</field><field name="subject">Australian Sex Role Scale</field><field name="subject">Adolescent Coping Scale</field><field name="subject">gender</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060613.142101</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Spoken communication and its assessment in large classes n upper secondary schools in Japan</field><field name="creator">Ando, Kimihito</field><field name="description">There is awareness and concern in Japan that
the process of teaching and learning English as a
foreign language in the school system does not produce
students who can communicate in the target language.
This is especially true of communication in the spoken
mode.
Attempts have been made to move towards more
communicative language teaching, despite constraints
such as large class size, compulsory use of
structurally-organized textbooks, and grammar-based
university entrance examinations. However, such
attempts do not seem to have been particularly
successful.
The purpose of this study is to suggest
modifications to the teaching of English in upper
secondary schools in Japan which could enable students
to develop their communicative competence and also to
consider implications for the assessment of spoken
communication.
Chapter I describes the scope and background of
the study.
Chapter II looks at the teaching of English in
upper secondary schools in Japan, discussing aspects
such as the place of English in the total school curriculum and constraints on the introduction of
spoken communicative activities.
Chapter III discusses the theory and practice of
the Communicative Approach to Language Teaching in the
English teaching context in Japan.
Chapter IV offers suggestions for incorporating
spoken communication in English lessons at upper
secondary school level.
In Chapter V, the problem of assessing oral
communicative performance is considered in practical
terms.
The final chapter highlights major constraints
and points to recent developments which may give an
impetus to a move towards more communicative teaching
of English as a foreign language in Japanese schools.
It is intended that this Study Report will
provide guidelines for the feasible introduction of
spoken communicative activities in large classes at
upper secondary level and that it will offer
practical suggestions for assessing students'
performance in such activities.</field><field name="date">1987</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Japan</field><field name="subject">teaching English as a second language</field><field name="subject">communicative approach</field><field name="subject">spoken communication</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060601.151239</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Being informed : a study in the communication of information to prospective migrants</field><field name="creator">Anderson, Wendy S. M.</field><field name="description">This Thesis is a study of the communication process through
which prospective migrants became informed about life in Australia. It
is addressed particularly to migration from Italy, where data was
obtained during the period 1979 to 1981. The Study focusses upon the
communication of information from official sources, namely the
government, as represented by the Department of Immigration and
Ethnic Affairs. Given the basic premise that appropriate information is
an important aid to settlement, the proposal is made that problems can
arise in the communication of that information.
Various solutions to problems of settlement have been sought and
applied since the inception of Australia's post-war immigration
program. While the period since 1977 has witnessed an increasing
attention to the provision of post-arrival services for migrants, it is
suggested that there has been little change in the provision of
information overseas which might assist prospective migrants in the
critical pre-migration period.
The Thesis sets out an historical overview of the problem: a
study of the principal participants in the present day context, a
report of the research undertaken in Italy to examine both the
communication process and the information needs of prospective
migrants, and an analysis of the data based upon the application of
communication theory.
The Study revealed that certain topics, for which prospective
migrants had expressed an information need, were not covered in
pre-migration counselling sessions. Information on other topics
reflected the orientation of the government, as communication source,
and the migration officer as transmitter, and were not within the frame
of reference of the applicants as receivers of the communication.
Lack of mutuality regarding the purposes of information transfer,
and the differing attitudes and perceptions of the participants in the
communication process, created problems. The Study found that
prospective migrants presented at different stages of readiness to
receive information, and that assumptions were made regarding the
information needs of Italian applicants which failed to take into account
the fact that conditions have changed within Italy. Group counselling
was initially successful, from a communication point of view, as a
two-way process, but its unexpected outcome was decreased efficiency
which conflicted with institutional objectives.
If the communication of information is accepted as an important
aid to settlement, the application of educational principles (which
should improve both the communication process and the information
conveyed) would lead to improved chances for settlement, with benefit
to prospective migrants, the government, and the receiving society.</field><field name="date">1985</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">immigration</field><field name="subject">migrants</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Italy</field><field name="subject">Department of Immigration and Ethinic Affairs</field><field name="subject">settlement</field><field name="subject">communication</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060601.153928</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The expectations of parents, students and

Australian English and Indonesian. It seeks to determine the crosscultural
similarities and differences in seeking and giving advice in both
languages in the areas of
(i) the use of language routines and strategies
(ii) the influences of cultural and social aspects.
Data were collected from two preliminary questionnaires and a Discourse
Completion Test (DCT). The DCT was completed by Australian and
Indonesian native speakers in their first language. Analysis focussed on
both qualitative and quantitative aspects. Findings reveal that speakers of
both languages use similar strategies in terms of politeness, directness or
indirectness and Speaker-or-Hearer Oriented utterances. The realization
of the language routines of advice seeking and giving in both languages
is, however, different. The influence of socio-cultural features is noticeable
in both languages in terms of formality, relationship of interlocutors, age
and gender. The results are not always consistent with the hypotheses
posed in the study.

practices of marketing communications in Thailand between 1987 to 1991, the
period of the Sixth National Economic and Social Development Plan. By using a
theoretical approach which combines features of both the &amp;quotedeterminist&amp;quote views of
the relation between marketing and economic development (Joy and Ross, 1989),
and the cultural dependency models (Reeves, 1993), the study takes a contextual
and qualitative cultural approach to understanding Thai marketing communications
practices.
The development of Thai marketing communications between 1987 to 1991
was marked by the rapid growth of the influence of transnational advertising
agencies (TNAAs) in Thailand, together with some substantial, but constrained,
development of local advertising agencies and other ancillary marketing
communications services. Advertising expenditure for the whole industry increased
by some 200 per cent in the period, whereas some 38 new agencies were
established as well, of which 34 were locally owned. The relative lack of capital of
local agencies and professionals, however, together with the dominant influence of
TNAAs on local marketing communications practices, meant that the growth of the
marketing communications industry took place within the parameters determined
by the TNAAs.
This theme of the interplay between the local and the global development of
marketing communications in Thailand is examined at different levels. The first
chapter analyzes aspects of the national economy with reference to the effect of the
National Economic and Social Development Plans and features of Thai culture and
society which were the framework of the marketing communications. The second
chapter then considers relevant Western and Thai literature to review earlier and
current theories about the relationship between marketing communications and
national development.
The bulk of the analysis is then made in Chapters Four to Six. Chapter Four
analyzes the Thai communication infrastructure and reviews the growth of
transnational media advertising within the context of mass communications, public
communications and communication for specific purposes. Mixed evidence
emerges here of both an improvement in parts of the mass media, and continuing
deficiencies in the telecommunication infrastructure.
Chapters Five and Six then analyze the development and changes in Thai
marketing communications in the period and the impact of globalization
respectively. This is done through a qualitative content analysis of two monthly
business magazines, Khoo Kaeng and Phoo Jad Karn, and two business
newspapers, Thansetthakit and Prachachart Thurakit. The analysis here shows the
dominance of a &amp;quoteMadison Avenue&amp;quote style of marketing communications among
TNAAs, as well as growing use of sales promotion, public relations, and direct
marketing by local marketers. It is concluded that the industry practices of Thai
marketing communications were mainly shaped by the actions of the TNAAs
operating within the policy framework set by the Thai government.</field><field name="date">1994</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">marketing communications</field><field name="subject">Thailand</field><field name="subject">economic development</field><field name="subject">cultural development</field><field name="subject">advertising agencies</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060605.133549</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effects of staging on the reader's comprehension of informational discourses</field><field name="creator">Bailey, John A.</field><field name="description">The study was concerned with the variable of staging which is
a component of text structure. Staging is known to affect the
comprehension process of proficient readers.
Two passages developed and analysed for staging by Clements
(1976) were used in this study to investigate the effects staging
has on the readers' comprehension of the passages. The two passages
were identical in content and different only in the staging level
at which information occurred.
Ten experimental texts were developed from Clements' two
passages. The texts enabled (i) the comparison of the effects of
supplying high, medium or low staged information to the readers
on their ability to replace cloze deletions in the rest of the
text: and (ii) the comparison of the effects of supplying intact
the staging categories Old Topic, New Topic, Old Comment, or New
Comment on the readers' ability to replace cloze deletions in the
rest of the text. The cloze replacement scores were taken as
measures of the readers' comprehension of the text.
The subjects used in this study were a mixture of male and
female, undergraduate and postgraduate students at Riverina College
of Advanced Education.
The height of staged information and the staging category of
the information were found to have no significant affect upon the
readers' comprehension of the texts. However, it is suggested
111
that this may be an artifact of the use of cloze procedure as the
measure of comprehension.
Suggestions are made for further research to clarify the
usefulness of cloze as a research tool in this area and to support
or reject the conclusion of this study.</field><field name="date">1980</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">staging</field><field name="subject">experimental texts</field><field name="subject">discourse</field><field name="subject">Riverina College of Advanced Education</field><field name="subject">readers' comprehension</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060605.145033</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Noun and prepositional phrases in English and Vietnamese : a contrastive analysis</field><field name="creator">Bang, Nguyen</field><field name="description">This study aims to discuss the noun and prepositional

problems arising particularly from differences between
English and Vietnamese.
In this study, Contrastive Linguistics is concerned
with the comparison of the two languages with a view to
determining the differences and similarities between
them. With this practical aim the study tries to provide
a model for comparison and determine how and which of the
phrases are comparable.
It is hoped to provide as much information as is
possible in a limited study of this kind on English noun
and prepositional phrases, then on Vietnamese noun phrases.
The study draws attention to differences with examples.
It analyses the heads of noun phrases in the two languages
as well as the pre and postmodifications and their
positions. It also analyses the uses of the prepositional
phrases in the two languages. At the same time, it points
out the kinds of errors made by Vietnamese learners in the
above-mentioned areas and their causes.

demand for Chinese speakers of English. But the existing
formal language institutions are far from enough to meet
such a great need. Consequently, large numbers of people
will have to learn English by themselves, self-directed to
different extents, depending on the facilities available
to them. There are also large numbers of potential selfdirected
learners who do not yet know where to start and
how to tackle the task.
Self-directed learning, either of English or of other
subjects, has always played an important role in China as
an alternative form of education. There have been many
successful self-directed learners who have made remarkable
contributions to the country in different fields.
However, self-directed learning of English on a large
scale is still a relatively new phenomenon. Some proper
guidance and the learners' awareness of the likely
difficult areas will make the learning both more effective
and more efficient.
This study will attempt to examine the gradual change from
teacher-centred teaching and learning to learner-centred
teaching and learning and the development of self-directed
learning. Then the study will try to provide information
on some of the self-directed learning programmes of interest
to Chinese learners. Afterwards, the study will examine the
basic needs and characteristics of Chinese self-directed
learners. The greater part of this study will be devoted to
the likely areas of difficulty of self-directed learners in
China and some possible ways to solve them. The last part
will deal with study skills in self-directed learning and
use of resources available.</field><field name="date">1984</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">self-directed learning</field><field name="subject">China</field><field name="subject">teacher-centred</field><field name="subject">learner-centred</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060607.153957</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The work attitudes and job perceptions of Commonwealth Government Libraians : with descriptive data on Commonwealth Government librarianship as an occupation</field><field name="creator">Barnes, Helen</field><field name="description">This study has three major purposes: to describe systematically the practice of
librarianship in Australian Commonwealth Government departments and agencies
from the perspective of librarians employed in that environment; to relate the
characteristics of government librarianship to librarians' perceptions of and
attitudes to their work; and to assess the extent to which the work of Commonwealth
Government librarians needs to be redesigned to improve the level of job satisfaction
they experience. A subsidiary purpose is to test the job characteristics theory of
work motivation on a population of librarians.
Information was gathered by a survey questionnaire on a range of variables relating
to librarians and their perceptions of different aspects of their jobs. The primary
instrument for gathering data on perceptions was the complete form of the Job
Diagnostic Survey.
The population under investigation comprised those Commonwealth Government
department and agency librarians employed on a full-time, permanent basis under
the Public Service Act 1922. and located in Canberra. Because the population was
small but diverse, it was decided to survey the total population rather than a random
or stratified sample. One hundred and eight usable responses were received which
represented a response rate of 83 percent.
The results of the survey were analysed using the Statistical Package for the Social
Sciences. Frequency distributions and Pearson's Product-Moment Correlations were
calculated to determine the percentage of respondents who selected each option and the
strength of relationships between pairs of variables.
The study found that Commonwealth Government department and agency librarians in
Australia are highly satisfied with their work generally, and with the environment
in which it is performed. None of the null hypotheses relating to Commonwealth
Government librarians and job satisfaction were rejected. All but one of the null
hypotheses retating to the application of the job characteristics model to
Commonwealth Government librarians are rejected.
The study concludes by identifying issues and areas for further research in public
sector librarianship.</field><field name="date">1987</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">librarians</field><field name="subject">librarianship</field><field name="subject">Australian Commonwealth Departments</field><field name="subject">public sector employment</field><field name="subject">job satisfaction</field><field name="subject">Job</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060607.154822</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Users and an online catalogue : an evaluation of the OPAC at the Dixson Library, University of New England</field><field name="creator">Barret, Beverley</field><field name="description">This thesis reports on a study undertaken at the Dixson Library, University of New
England. The purpose of the study was to develop an understanding of users of online
public access catalogues (OPACs). The understanding gained from the study will assist
in the development of improvements to the Library's OPAC, and increase user ability to
access information from the OPAC. The study replicated the user questionnaire of the
Online Patron Access Project, sponsored by the Council on Library Resources (CLR) in
1981/83. The questionnaire was modified slightly to suit conditions at the Dixson
Library.
The study addressed nine research questions relating to the users, their reactions,
attitudes, experiences and problems. The user task and their suggestions for
improvement were also addressed. The study formally tested three propositions between
the variables user task, success and attitudes in relation to OPAC users.
The findings show the analysis of the responses for the population as a whole, and,
where relevant, for eight groups of student respondents based on their academic
affiliation. The student population was of particular importance because of the
preponderance of external students at the University of New England. The differences in
the findings between the groups of students were discussed, and where possible,
explained. The three formal propositions were tested by carrying out Chi square tests for
the values of each variable. Nine significant relationships were found.
Comparisons were made between the Dixson Library findings and those of the CLR

of reasons. In determining these reasons, the diagnostician will need
to consider among other intellectual functioning, environmental
influences, biological and emotional disorders and cultural differences.
What also needs to be included is how students view themselves
as people and as students - that is, their feelings of self-worth or
self-esteem.
Very often the solution to a child's learning problems are looked
for in the cognitive areas, when it is this affective aspect of
learning that requires attention.
There is ample research evidence to show, that children with poor
opinions of thier self-worth, are less likely to be doing well at
school than children who have a high opinion of themselves.
Less clear however, is the actual cause and effect relationship.
That is, is it more usual to find low self-esteem causing poor school
performance or does poor school performance cause low self-esteem.
This study assumes that low self-esteem is likely to be a major
cause of poor performance and that any efforts to change a child's
opinion of himself in a positive way, will result in improved
performance - in this particular case - at reading.
As self-esteem is largely learned from interaction with significant
others, an attempt was made to influence the self opinions of a group
of children by specific counselling of these 'others', here, their
parents and teacher.
The major thrust of the counselling was directed towards the
parents, although it is understood that an equal amount of effort
with the teachers of the children involved would have been justified.
In a program extending over ten one and one half sessions,
parents of an experimental group of children, were counselled in
two groups. The aims of the program were to provide parents with
an awareness of how their child's self concept is formed, how it
affects their achievement in school and how they might influence
its change. In the study, this experimental group did not show
any significant gain in achievement or self-esteem over the control
group. Nevertheless, there emerged a number of useful implications
for better practice in the field of educational counselling.</field><field name="date">1978</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">learning difficulties</field><field name="subject">self-esteem</field><field name="subject">parents</field><field name="subject">teachers</field><field name="subject">educational counselling</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060607.164310</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Towards an ESP reading syllabus for the first year undergraduate students at Bogar Agricultural University (IPB)</field><field name="creator">Barus, Irma Rasita Gloria</field><field name="description">The never ending argument among linguists and teachers
about whether reading difficulties of the non native speakers of
English are a reading problem or a language problem is an
interesting study to start with. This was one of the questions
examined in the study leading to the development of an ESP
syllabus for undergraduate students at Bogor Agricultural University
(IPB).
Chapter One outlines the current English course at IPB
where the focus of language teaching is on teaching grammar and
reading.
Chapter Two looks at the theoretical background and the
development of ESP as well as the role of the ESP teachers which
is different from the role of General English teachers.
Since reading is the only target skill students need to
acquire, Chapter Three looks at the theory of reading, outlines
necessary reading skills and examines a 'good1 reading teacher.
Chapter Four consists of a study and its analysis into
whether difficulties in reading is a reading problem or a language
problem. These findings are expected to give a clearer idea to the
teachers of reading about the problems encountered by the
students in reading English texts so they can decide whether the
focus of the course should be on grammar development or reading
development.
Chapter Five discusses several types of syllabus as well as
relating to the importance of needs analysis in designing a course,
and suggests an outline syllabus for the IPB students i.e. the
proportional syllabus including the profile of communication needs,
aims and objectives of the course, language content, and the
syllabus content.</field><field name="date">1991</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ESP syllabus</field><field name="subject">Bogar Agricultural University</field><field name="subject">IPB</field><field name="subject">language teaching</field><field name="subject">reading development</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060607.170018</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An ethnographic study of ESL students at a Canberra high school</field><field name="creator">Bessell, Susan</field><field name="description">This ethnographic study was undertaken in order to examine the

existed within the ACT Public School System. These approaches
are in theory based on different educational ideologies and
principles.
The Field Study Project evaluates and compares three
different educational models; existing classroom processes
and procedures, and student achievements in a 'traditional',
a modified Montessori and a Weikart pre-school currently
operating in the ACT Public School System.
Using selected criteria, an analysis of the three educational
models, an ecological survey and student assessments
were carried out to make the evaluations and comparisons.
The analysis of the three educational models indicate
different program orientations and instructional preferences
in the different models.
The ecological survey results suggest that the
'traditional', the modified Montessori and the Weikart approaches
identify with the models they are based on. Nevertheless,
educational trends and orientations are similar in the three
programs, which are predominantly cognitively oriented. In
contrast, teaching styles differ slightly. It is significant
that the teacher in the 'traditional' program fulfills a more
nurturing role, while her colleagues in the modified
Montessori and the Weikart programs fulfill more instructional
roles.
The evaluation and comparison of the student assessments
seems to indicate that there are no significant differences
in achievement in drawing, specific cognitive tasks and in
self-concept development between matched groups of learners
in the three pre-schools.
The findings support the notion that middle class children
enrolled in approved pre-schools develop cognitive abilities
regardless of the type of program they attend.
The evaluation and comparison of the three existing
approaches in the ACT suggests that the pre-school organisation
in the ACT Public School System is still strongly committed
to the 'traditional' model, and makes only minor attempts to
change educational patterns in pre-school education.</field><field name="date">1985</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">pre-school</field><field name="subject">Montessori</field><field name="subject">Weikart</field><field name="subject">Australian Capital Territory</field><field name="subject">ACT</field><field name="subject">public schools</field><field name="subject">educational models</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060608.142516</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Problems associated with the process of educational software design</field><field name="creator">Boland, Robert John</field><field name="description">The problems associated w i t h the process of educational
software design are complex and need to be considered from a
number of different perspectives. In this study a number of
factors are identified as contributing to difficulties
generally experienced by software designers. It is
suggested, however, that the factor which underlies all
others is ineffective or inefficient communication. As the
design of Educational Software Systems is a complex, multidisciplined
process, the communication of primary interest
is that between between experts from different disciplines.
To help focus on such problems and processes most discussion
is in terms of two representative experts: a Teacher or
Educator, and a Computer Programmer or Systems Analyst.
In the first chapter the complexity of the task of
categorising and evaluating information about educational
software is discussed. A need is recognised for some form of
conceptual construct which would allow direction and
progress in software design to be determined. The concept of
a continuum between the &amp;quoteComputer as Tool&amp;quote and the &amp;quoteComputer
as Tutor&amp;quote is introduced as a logical basis for such a
construct.
In this and several other chapters the focus is on the
design of Intelligent Educational Software, while not
intending to imply that this is its only useful or
desirable form. If, however, the design of Intelligent
Educational Software is better understood, the designing of
less complex forms of software should become much easier,
and will make possible the teaching of Educational Software
Design as a topic for formal study.
The second chapter addresses the problem of interpersonal
communication between experts in different disciplines who
have no common technical language. The design of educational
software is made more difficult by the fact that teachers
find it difficult to describe &amp;quotewhat they do&amp;quote when they
teach. The concept of a language of accommodation is
introduced and discussed.
The general problem of software acquisition, design
management, and evaluation is addressed in chapter Three.
The interaction between the roles of Educator and System
Analyst is considered in relation to the types of software
available today. It is suggested that collaborative design
between experts from different fields can be described and
analysed as a set of complex learning behaviours. The
process of design is recognised as a learning process which,
if better understood, can be improved and taught.
Chapter four considers the problem of human/machine
interaction. An operational model, or designer's check list,
to aid in the design of a Student/Machine software interface
is discussed on the assumption that the student, the
computer, and the software interface, can be considered as
three independent, but interacting systems. By way of
illustration a model is developed which could be used to
design software for use in adult education.
Chapter Five is in two parts, each part dealing with
essentially the same concept - the transmission of knowledge
about the process of educational software design. Two major
strategies are considered. Firstly, the concept of a
Microfactor is introduced as a way in which practitioners in
the field of educational software design might communicate
about solutions to certain problems.
The chapter then proposes and discusses a unit of study for
teachers on the topic of Educational Software Design in
which practitioners communicate with beginners. The main
focus of this unit, to be called &amp;quoteEducational Software
Design&amp;quote, is on (1) Need for problem solving skills in
educational Software Design; (2) Need for communication
skills to facilitate collaboration between experts; (3) Need
for a schema which will assist in the structuring of
knowledge about educational software design. It is modelled
on an existing unit in a BA(TAFE/ADULT) course which has
been running for several years. A detailed description of
this prototype unit and its design is given in appendix A
and B.
To conclude the study, Chapter Six considers some of the
possible attitudinal barriers which can severely restrict
the use of educational software. Even the most expertly
designed software will be of no benefit if it is not used.</field><field name="date">1985</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">educational software</field><field name="subject">design</field><field name="subject">inrerpersonal communication</field><field name="subject">human machine interaction</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060608.144929</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Music in Australian education : an historical and philisophical analysis</field><field name="creator">Bonham, Gillian</field><field name="description">This Field Study Report represents a preliminary inquiry or
prolegomenon to a Philosophy of Music Education in Australia.
My concern here is with the nature and function of music in
Australian education, especially of young people. I am not
concerned with the technical details of education and training
in the musical art itself: my aim is rather to distinguish and
account for public and professional attitudes towards music in
Australian education, by identifying their philosophical sources
and social determinants.
The Introduction begins with a general historical background,
including detailed references to the important developments of
the past decade that have dramatically altered the role and
raised public awareness of music in Australia.
Chapter I, 'The Politics of Music in School and Society' argues
that the philosophy of music education derives from two classical
sources: Plato, the inspiration for music educators in totalitarian
societies; and Aristotle, for education in the liberal
democracies. A recent review (Sparshott 1980) indicates that
these two philosophies are still key positions in the field.
Chapter II, 'The Tradition of Music in Australian Education'
shows how the philosophies of Plato and Aristotle, with Locke's
utilitarianism, have influenced music education since colonial
times, and how British pedagogical traditions have been modified
by adaption to a new society and ethos.
Chapter III, 'Music in Contemporary Australian Education'
reviews recent empirical studies of the subject, showing,
the persistence of traditional attitudes and basic problems.
Chapter IV, 'The Right to Music: Aims and Methods' reports
the empirical part of this Field Study - recorded interviews
and discussions with adults and children involved in Australian
music education and associated activities. These were the
subject of a series of eight radio programs, first broadcast
nationally by the Australian Broadcasting Commission, November
1979 to February 1980, subsequently rebroadcast twice, and now
published on cassette (1981)
Chapter V, 'The Right to Music : the Broadcast Series' consists
of cassette recordings of the broadcast discussions, together
with minimally edited transcriptions of the text.
In my Conclusion, 'Philosophy of Music Education in Australia:
the Three Traditions', I offer a preliminary analysis of contemporary
Australian attitudes towards music in education as
revealed by the broadcast discussion. I conclude that, while
Australian music educators have been untrained philosophically,
their attitudes (like those of society at large) towards music
in education derive, in the main, from Plato, Aristotle and Locke.</field><field name="date">1982</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">music education</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">attitudes</field><field name="subject">philosophy of music education</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060608.154145</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Universal service and people with disabilities : an anlysis of telecommunications policy making from 1975-1997</field><field name="creator">Bourk, Michael J.</field><field name="description">This thesis analyses the development of telecommunications universal service in relation
to people with disabilities and national policy making in Australia from 1975 to the end of
1997.
The history of public policy development in telecommunications universal service
obligations is analysed to gain an understanding of how different political, scientific,
social symbolic and material contexts have influenced policy. It is argued that social
symbolic and material contexts mutually constitute telecommunications policy. Social
symbolic influences, such as charity and 'rights' discourses of disability, have framed
telecommunications policy toward people with disabilities. Material contexts, including
changing technological, economic and legislative environments, have created favourable
conditions for either charity or 'rights' models of disability, and have dominated related
policy arenas at various times. The study demonstrates that policy arenas influenced by
certain discourses, may also lead to changes within the material environments.
The influence of community interest groups is also analysed to investigate their effect on
telecommunications policy. Associated with interest group influence on
telecommunications policy is a joint consultative process initiated by Telstra and
consumer groups in 1988. The value of the consultative process to people with
disabilities is evaluated.
A key focus of this study is the consideration given by policy makers to the interests of
people with a disability in the continuing debate on access and equity issues in relation to
telecommunications services for all Australians. A turning-point in telecommunications
policy for people with disabilities occurred in 1995, when various people with a disability
made a successful complaint against Telstra to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity
Commission (HREOC). The outcome forced a major change of policy in
telecommunications service delivery and benefited many who have disabilities.
The HREOC inquiry is a useful case study which indicates the significance of the
mutually constitutive effect on policy stemming from the dynamic interaction of social
symbolic environments and material conditions. The research revealed that policy in this
area may be described as a pluralist, non-linear process. Government and Telstra policy
makers have found telecommunications policy a problematic area to reconcile with
universal service obligations.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">disabilities</field><field name="subject">telecommunications services</field><field name="subject">public policy</field><field name="subject">universal service obligations</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060608.160344</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Aboriginal Studies Resource Centre for the ACT</field><field name="creator">Bourke, Colin J.</field><field name="description">The aim of this thesis is to provide a framework, background material and
argument for the A.C.T. Aboriginal community and other Aboriginal
educational and cultural groups to develop submissions seeking funds for
Aboriginal Studies Resource Centres. The ACT Aboriginal Education
Consultative Group has given the thesis a definite focus and underlined the
importance of gaining Aboriginal, systemic and political support.
The study includes both theoretical and empirical components and practical
suggestions as to the organisation and activities of such a centre. The
early part of the study is devoted to providing background to an Aboriginal
Studies Resource Centre, it also covers the formation and development of the
A.C.T. Aboriginal Education Consultative Group.
Following the outlining of the aims and objectives of such a centre,
theoretical issues concerned with selection and organisation of centre
materials, the need for interpretation of objectives and the understanding
of values together with curriculum implications and learning activities of
an Aboriginal studies resource centre are discussed. Two major thrusts in
these discussions are that Aboriginal people must be involved and the
question of values must be considered because human behaviour depends on
values, and behavioural change is regarded as one of the main measures of
success.
It is intended that while an Aboriginal Studies resource centre should
concentrate on its local area, it should draw materials from other parts of
Australia and the world, so that the local area can be placed in context.
It is envisaged that the materials would come from a wide range of
disciplines.
The A.C.T. Centre will endeavour to increase the comprehension of A.C.T.
Aborigines and non-Aborigines in matters Aboriginal, and will follow a
philosophy which holds that learning is the discovery of meaning or
understanding. A range of learning activities, including hands on
experiences are outlined. The functions of the Centre are described and the
involvement of Aborigines and non-Aborigines at all levels is discussed.
Evaluation of the Centre's success or otherwise will take cognisance of its
objectives and involve a range of outcomes. It is acknowledged that success
will be difficult to measure because of different amounts of student time
spent at the Centre and teacher and student expectations.
The thesis concludes that Aboriginal studies has not achieved its rightful
place in Australian education and that an Aboriginal Studies Resource Centre
would provide the material and human resources required for Aboriginal
studies to take its proper place in Australian education.</field><field name="date">1987</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Aboriginal Studies Resource Centres</field><field name="subject">Australian Capital Territory</field><field name="subject">ACT</field><field name="subject">Aboriginal community</field><field name="subject">Aboriginal studies</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060609.133137</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An exploratory study of children with learning difficulties in mainstream classes in ACT primary schools</field><field name="creator">Bourke, Margaret</field><field name="description">There were four aims identified for the study. Firstly,
to become familiar with current research concerning
children with learning difficulties in mainstream classes
in primary schools. Secondly, to ascertain teachers'
attitudes towards, and experience of, these children.
Thirdly, to interview a sample of children identified by
their teachers as performing in all academic areas at
least 18 months behind the rest of the class. The purpose
of the interview was to examine how they perceived their
performance in reading and mathematics compared with the
rest of the class, and to investigate their self-concepts.
The final aim was to gain an understanding of the nature
of the interaction between teachers and children with
learning difficulties by observing a small sample of
them, and a Control group, in class.
Field work was conducted in three A.C.T. primary
schools in 1984-85. The field work was divided into three
stages. In Stage 1 a sample of 30 teachers volunteered to
complete a questionnaire. In Stage 2 a sample of 30
children identified by their teachers as having learning
difficulties was interviewed. In Stage 3, 6 of the
previously identified children and 6 Control children
were observed in class.
Whilst the findings of these 3 stages of field work
can only be presented tentatively due to the small sample
sizes involved, there were some findings worthy of
comment. For example, many teachers indicated a lack
of pre-service training, or even in-service course attendance
which could have provided a background to teaching
children with learning difficulties.
The childrens' responses indicated that their perception
of their performance in reading compared with their
peers was that they were &amp;quotenot as good as the rest of the
class.&amp;quote However, for mathematics their perception was
that their performance was more in the middle of the
class. As a group their self-concept was low, as measured
on the Coopersmith Self Esteem Inventory. From the
observation it appeared that children with learning
difficulties were on-task as much as the Control children.
The teacher was twice as likely to interact with a child
with learning difficulties than with a Control child,
and the majority of these interactions were to impart
instructions.</field><field name="date">1985</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">learning difficulties</field><field name="subject">primary school students</field><field name="subject">teachers</field><field name="subject">Austraian Capital Territory</field><field name="subject">ACT</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060609.143034</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An analysis of peer drug education : a case study</field><field name="creator">Broad, Barbara Patricia</field><field name="description">Drug use and misuse by young people is a problem and concern in
the Australian and Australian Capital Territory (ACT) communities.
There are concerns regarding illicit and licit drugs but licit drug use
has been identified as the major area of concern. Young people in
the ACT reflect the drug use/misuse patterns and trends of other
states. Commonly used drugs by young people are alcohol, tobacco,
cannabis and analgesics.
Strategies to address the problem of drug use/misuse by young
people include intervention and community drug education programs.
Peer drug education (as an example of community drug education),
trains young people as peer educators to implement drug education
programs with younger age groups.
A case study analysis based on qualitative, naturalistic and new
paradigm research is the research method used in this thesis.
An eclectic model of drug education including key components from a
variety of drug education models provides a comprehensive overview
of peer drug education. The literature review showed the complexity
of influences on drug use/misuse. These influences relate to
individual, peer, parental and family, community and societal factors.
Peer drug education is generally recognised as an effective drug
education strategy.
Peer drug education programs (Triple T: Teenagers Teaching
Teenagers) were conducted in the ACT from 1988-1990. Reports
documenting these programs (including evaluation data) and a
literative review are the main data analysed for the case study.
The case study analysis of five ACT peer drug education programs
and one interstate program showed the key planning issues for
effective peer drug education were:
collaborative decision making as a central concept;
detailed planning and liaison with target groups;
established structures within schools and communities to
support the trained peer educators;
team work and small group work as intrinsic and extrinsic
factors within the program;
clarification of responsibilities and roles of all personnel
involved in the program; and
facilitators/leaders with attributes and qualities that encourage
peer drug educators as social change agents.
Analysis of data from the case study reports showed young people
can be effective peer drug educators. Residential programs are
preferred over non-residential programs. Peer drug education
programs are effective in both school and community agencies.
The literature review and analysis of reports also indicated that peer
drug education needs to focus on establishing positive norms in
groups of young people. Collaborative decision making and positive
role modelling assist in the establishment of these norms. Peer drug
education links to the wider changes occurring in education and
health settings. Peer drug education is about collaborative decision
making, social justice, development of key competencies and social
change.
This thesis confirmed the complexity and dynamic nature of peer drug
education and there were many questions raised for further research
from the literature review and analysis of program reports.</field><field name="date">1992</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Australian Capital Territory</field><field name="subject">ACT</field><field name="subject">drug abuse</field><field name="subject">youth</field><field name="subject">alcohol</field><field name="subject">tobacco</field><field name="subject">cannabis</field><field name="subject">analgesics</field><field name="subject">triple T</field><field name="subject">peer drug education</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060613.132241</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The ACT year 12 certificate : a student based review</field><field name="creator">Brocklebank, R. J.</field><field name="description">The aim of this Field Study is to establish the
extent to which Year 12 students understand and appreciate
the ACT College System of senior secondary and the
information which appears on the ACT Year 12 Certificate.
In order to provide the reader with a basis for
understanding what happens over the final two years of
secondary education in the ACT the author has established
the historical context that gave rise to the establishment
of the Secondary Colleges in the ACT. This brief history
outlines the causes and reasons which led to separation
from the NSW state system of education and the decision
to develop a different approach to the provision of
education for students in Year 11 and 12.
To provide an idea of how the system works a description
of what makes up the College System is provided.
This includes an explanation of how the colleges relate
to the high schools, their curriculum, the accreditation
of courses, assessment and certification. The role of
the ACT Schools Accrediting Agency is explained in the
way it underpins the credibility of the system and of
how it carries the responsibility for the final generation
of the ACT Year 12 Certificate.
While this study looks at the system some seven
years after it began, earlier evaluations had taken place
which examined matters linked with the ACT Year 12
Certificate. In writing this report the author reviews
two important assessments of the system, one of the
role of the ACT Schools Accrediting Agency and the other
concerned with the success of the Colleges as educational
institutions from a student viewpoint. The author also
attempts to compare the changes which came with the ACT
College System with recent developments and current
thinking about senior secondary education in other Australian
states.
The major part of the Field Study was a survey of
a sample of Year 12 students at the end of 1983 to
establish the extent to which they understood the aspects
of the system they had been a part of for two years. The
data and findings of this survey are presented.
The report concludes with an outline of the most
recent changes, developments and reactions which in some
way affect the system. At the end of the conclusion,
the author presents a list of recommendations aimed at
overcoming some of the problems pin-pointed in the report.</field><field name="date">1985</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australian Capital Territory</field><field name="subject">ACT</field><field name="subject">ACT College System</field><field name="subject">year 12 certificate</field><field name="subject">ACT Schools Accrediting Agency</field><field name="subject">year 12 students</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060613.133106</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An exploratory study of the counselling process during focusing and clients' verbal expressions of experiencing and self-acceptance</field><field name="creator">Broda, Juliana</field><field name="description">This study explored the application of the counselling
technique called Focusing, with three subjects each attending
four counselling sessions.
A background view of Focusing identified major contributions
from existential, experiential and transpersonal fields of
psychology associated with the phenomenological school of
counselling therapy.
Naturalistic inquiry was used as a method to devise a
cumulative exploration of self-acceptance and experiencing.
The Focusing technique, first devised by Eugene Gendlin in
the 1960's, was modified prior to the main study and then
implemented as a combined counselling/training
intervention. A grounded theory procedure provided the basis
of a qualitative methodological examination for the study and
triangulation was effected using quantitative instruments to
examine an empirical outcome of the intervention for selfacceptance.
The Focusing intervention was developed as a prepared script
elicited by the researcher, followed by unstructured debriefing
which included embedded questions about acceptance of self
and the subject's process of experiencing during the
intervention.
Prior to commencement of the study, the researcher held
some ideas but no preconceived assumptions about the
outcome of the intervention in terms of its effect upon subject
self-acceptance and experiencing.
Upon analysis of the quantitative and qualitative results, it
was concluded that exposure to a counselling process such as
Focusing affects openness to and awareness of potential
breadth, depth and expression of individual experiencing.
Empirical measures of self-acceptance produced inconclusive
results in pre- and post-testing, being more adequately
explored in the outcomes of qualitative analyses. During the
course of the study, five innovative methods of investigation
were utilised and found to be suitable for further development
towards future research.</field><field name="date">1993</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">counselling</field><field name="subject">Focusing</field><field name="subject">Eugene Gendlin</field><field name="subject">self-acceptance</field><field name="subject">experiencing</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060613.143715</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The influence of secondary treated effluent on denitrification in a natural wetland</field><field name="creator">Brodrick, Stephanie J.</field><field name="description">The influence of effluent addition on denitrification potential in the
Thredbo Wetland was observed by comparing an area of the wetland
receiving secondary treated effluent with another area receiving no
effluent addition.
Physico-chemical measurements (Eh, pH and temperature) of the soil were
conducted in both sampling areas to characterise the denitrifying
environment. Levels of nitrate plus nitrite and ammonium ion in the
soil from 0-30cm depth were recorded on a seasonal basis to identify the
role of effluent addition and vertical distribution of inorganic nitrogen species in controlling the distribution of denitrification
potential in the soil.
Denitrification potentials of soils and decaying plant material were
evaluated by the acetylene blockage technique. This involved laboratory
incubations under optimum conditions of pH, temperature, nitrate
concentration, carbon supply, and diffusion. The influence of these
physico-chemical factors on denitrification was also investigated.
It was found that the effluent addition caused higher denitrification
potential in soils and surface decaying plant material by raising soil
temperature, lowering Eh, and increasing concentrations of nitrate plus
nitrite and ammonium ions. The highest denitrification potential was
recorded in the decaying plant material on the soil surface. The highest
soil denitrification potential occurred in the 0-6cm depth segment.
Carbon supply and pH had no influence on denitrification potential
whilst low temperature (5&#186;C), and restricted diffusion limited
denitrification.
In terms of tertiary water treatment denitrification in Thredbo Wetland
makes a significant-contribution to the removal of nitrogen year-round.
However, total nitrogen removal could be increased by increasing the

subject in schools and many tertiary institutions of
Vietnam. The need to train teachers of English is greater
than ever before.
However, in the Hanoi Foreign Languages Teachers
Training College (HFLTTC), English language teaching in
general and the teaching of oral skills in particular leave
much room for improvement. The students' oral proficiency is
far from satisfactory.
This problem has inspired the writing of this
study report as an attempt to search for an appropriate
method to improve the students' communicative competence.
The study consists of four chapters. Chapter one
will overview some English Language Teaching (ELT) methods
in relation to teaching spoken English and their application
in Vietnam.
Chapter two will consider the context of the
HFLTTC where teaching and learning are carried out with a
view to identifying an appropriate approach to the problem.
Chapter three will outline communicative
competence as an objective of the ELT and discuss principles
of the communicative approach to attain the objective, and
suggest teaching material through which the principles can
be applied.
Chapter four will recommend the classroom
techniques which may improve the students' oral proficiency.
This study report should be regarded as an
attempt to apply the communicative approach to teaching oral
skills to students in the context of Vietnam.</field><field name="date">1988</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Hanoi Foreign Languages Teachers Trainin College</field><field name="subject">english language teaching</field><field name="subject">Vietnam</field><field name="subject">communicative competence</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060608.151436</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The student assessed</field><field name="creator">Broughton, Richard</field><field name="description">Interviews were held with 126 Year 10 and 23 Year 11 students
to obtain a description of the knowledge that students had
about the way they were assessed. Data was obtained about the
grades the students received, or expected to receive. The
students also completed the same attitude scales in both sets
of interviews. The most suitable criterion for analysing the
Year 11 interview data was found to be the changes in
assignment grades between Year 10 and Year 11. The criterion
was verified by analysing the attitudinal data. Changes in
attitude, based on relative grade changes, showed that the
most negative attitude changes occurred with students who
had obtained higher grades in Year 10 than they had in Year
11. The differences in grading practices between the high
schools and the secondary college meant that the majority of
students obtained lower grades in Year 11 than they did in
Year 10. Students were found to have a selective knowledge of
the assessment system with the most "academically successful"
students knowing more about the assessment system than the
"academically less successful". Two underlying constructs,
communication and realism, are used in an attempt to
explain the data. The approach of asking students about
assessment is recommended for use an evaluative tool in

upon a non-government school during the first years
of his leadership. Theories of organizational change
and leadership behaviour provide the theoretical
framework for this investigation.
The changes that were sought at Marist College,
Pearce, have their origin in 1983 with the appointment
of the fourth headmaster of that College. Prior to this
time Marist College had developed a reputation for conservatism
and strong leadership.
The College had grown since its foundation into a
comparatively large institution, both in terms of physical
size, personnel and student enrolment. The new headmaster
saw the need to review the goals of the College with the
aim to better the pastoral care of the large student body.
The result of this evaluation was the identification of a
series of changes that would open the College to new
approaches involving structural changes, devolution of
authority and personalization of the College.
The study identifies and documents the ideals hoped
to be achieved by the headmaster. What were seen as
ideals were not in ail cases practical. The difficulties
and problems faced by him in the implementation of these
changes are also examined.
Headmasters' terms of office are limited resulting
in new headmasters being appointed regularly. Each
brings to that office his own style and ideals. The
difficulties faced in the types of change analysed in
this study may be common to organizations experiencing
a change in leadership style.</field><field name="date">1987</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Marist College</field><field name="subject">non-government schools</field><field name="subject">leadership</field><field name="subject">headmasters</field><field name="subject">organizational change</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060614.163232</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Towards an in situ technique for investigating the role nutrients play in epilithon growth in an Australian upland stream</field><field name="creator">Brown, Glen</field><field name="description">There is limited knowledge and understanding of the role of nutrients and effect of
herbivore grazing on epilithon production in Australian upland rivers. Before
investigating these processes, a method was required that will allow the study of factors
(physical, chemical and biological) that affect epilithon abundance and distribution in
lotic systems. The Thredbo River, Kosciusko National Park, New South Wales,
provided an opportunity to conduct this investigation because it: is relatively
undisturbed; has been intensely studied; is easily accessed; and is of appropriate width
and depth to conduct in-stream experiments.
The specific goals of this research were the: (1) validation of the nutrient-diffusing
substrate method for investigating epilithon responses to nutrients; (2) development of
experimental channels in which to investigate nutrient/epilithon dynamics in an upland
stream; (3) development of a method to inhibit macroinvertebrate grazing from in situ
experimental channels, so that epilithon responses to nutrients with and without grazing
pressure can be studied; and (4) assessment of the ecological implications of nutrient/
epilithon/macroinvertebrate interactions assessed from in-stream experiments.
Major achievements of my research, that advance the study of stream ecology, are as
follows: 
&#183; The investigation of the features of nutrient release from terracotta nutrientdiffusing
substrates showed that phosphorus does not readily diffuse through
terracotta clay, probably because terracotta contains known binding agents for
phosphorus, such as iron, and because pores are easily blocked. I concluded that
this type of substrate is inappropriate for studying nutrient dynamics and epilithon
responses to the nutrient(s) limiting growth. The outcomes of this research has
implications for future research using nutrient-diffusing substrates, and of how
nutrient limitation information is interpreted from past research using terracotta
nutrient-diffusing substrates.
&#183; I designed and tested in-stream experimental channels that were functional and
provided near natural conditions for studying the interactions between nutrients/
epilithon/macroinvertebrates, without affecting physical variables not tested for.
The in situ method developed was successful in simulating 'real world'
complexities. Clay paving bricks were used as standardized common surface for
community development because their colour, size and surface texture are similar
to those of natural stones.
&#183; I developed a technique for successfully inhibiting macroinvertebrate grazing from
designated areas, using electricity, without affecting flow and light. This technique
will enable in-stream herbivory studies to assess the effects of macroinvertebrate
grazing pressure on epilithon under natural conditions, including variability in
flow, temperature, light and nutrients. It will allow the vexed question of whether
epilithon biomass is controlled by bottom-up or top-down processes to be
objectively addressed.
The construction of in situ experimental channels that simulate natural conditions,
combined with the non-intrusive methods of macroinvertebrate exclusion and nutrient
addition, resulted in a study design that will facilitate the investigation of biotic
responses to nutrients in Australian upland streams. Using the method developed, I
showed that variable flows in the upper Thredbo River appear high enough to slough
epilithon, but not high enough to dislodge macroinvertebrates. This may mean that in
systems such as the Thredbo River that experience frequent low level disturbance, the
epilithon is unable to reach equilibrium. There is strong top-down control of epilithon
in this stream, with nutrients, temperature and light playing a secondary role. I
concluded that natural variability may be more important than previously considered
and perhaps this, rather than constancy, should be studied.
This thesis adds support to the continuance of multiple factor investigations, and
advocates that such studies be conducted under natural conditions so that the results
are more relevant to natural systems than from studies conducted in controlled
laboratory and outdoor artificial streams. Clearly, the in-stream channels, developed as
part of the current research, will allow research that contributes to our understanding of
community responses to the physical, chemical and biological processes operating in
lotic environments.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">epilithon production</field><field name="subject">nutrients</field><field name="subject">herbivore grazing</field><field name="subject">upland rivers</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">in-stream experiments</field><field name="subject">Thredbo River</field><field name="subject">in situ technique</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060614.171246</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effect of culture on children's drawing development</field><field name="creator">Brown, Ian</field><field name="description">Few would deny the importance of art education in the total

component of art education. Drawing for children appears to be a
natural form of expression. Studies involving the observation of
children's drawing development have had a long history in relation to
child art. Recognition that children pass through identifiable stages of
development in drawing and that these stages could be affected by
cultural and individual differences is an important focus in art education
research.
This study is concerned firstly with drawing development and
secondly, with differences in drawing development across cultures.
Eight year old children with predominantly European background and
eight year old children with Vietnamese/Kampuchean background were
chosen for this study.
The study was concerned with determining whether there were
any significant differences in drawing development between the two

S.</field><field name="description">1. It is now generally accepted that conservation is an important
consideration for developing countries. (l. 1 &amp; 1.2)
2. This has been made clear in the World Conservation Strategy, published
in 1980, which sets out the essential link between conservation and
development. Three conservation objectives are identified:
- Maintenance of essential ecological processes
- Preservation of genetic diversity
- Ensuring sustainable utilisation of species and ecosystems (1.3)
3. Foreign aid donors have recognised the importance of conservation
considerations in their aid programs. The World Bank has had an environmental
program since 1970 and USAID since 1975. The emphasis has shifted
from the environmental impact of projects towards projects intended to bring
conservation benefits. Interest has recently been directed toward biological
diversity and wildlands. (1.4)
4. Although Australia has significant expertise in conservation, only in
the last couple of years has interest in the conservation aspects of
Australia's development assistance program been expressed. Australian
support for the World conservation Strategy indicates that conservation
concerns should be included in the aid program. (1.5)
5. Conservation and environmental assessment should be an integral part of
the processes of project appraisal and evaluation. The techniques used in
appraisal and evaluation such as the logical framework and cost benefit
analysis can be linked to environmental assessment, (chapter 2)
6. Many environmental guidelines are available, however these should not
be used directly for project appraisal and evaluation but rather to assist
in the preparation of project specific terms of reference. (2.6)
The intensification of some farming systems damages the ecological
processes on which they depend and hence reduces productivity. Other farming
systems can be intensified without ecological damage. The challenge is to
ensure that when farming is to be intensified it can be done without adverse
ecological consequences. (3.1, 3.2)
8. Constraints on the adoption of sustainable farming systems include the
perceptions, attitudes and knowledge of the society affected, economic
limitations and problems of land tenure. (3.3)
9. Foreign aid donors can make a contribution towards establishing
sustainable farming systems but past project designs have often not been
well suited to conservation. (3.4)
10. Projects can be developed with conservation goals which will conserve
the land, improve subsistence farming and assist with economic production.
There are three stages in these projects:
- Identify the causes of land degradation and the constraints to
countering them.
- Develop and demonstrate appropriate farming systems
- Extension (3.5)
11. A project is likely to have a greater impact if it leads to the
adoption of appropriate conservation techniques over a region than if it
intensively improves a restricted project area. A project must therefore
seek to develop techniques which will be adopted without subsidy. (3.4, 3.5)
12. The Australian projects in northern Thailand have successfully
demonstrated farming systems which would reduce erosion but these have yet
to be adopted on a significant scale by the population in the region. (4.2)
13. The NTT Livestock Development Project in Timor has not yet had
sufficient time to demonstrate suitable farming systems but it is expected
that such systems can be developed. (4.3)
14. In Sikka, Flores, Indonesia, the widespread planting of contour hedgerows
of leucaena has brought substantial conservation benefits. The key
factors in the adoption of this practice appear to have been that the
technique was readily undertaken by fanners, it increases crop yields and
that there was strong support from the local administration. (4.3)
15. It should be possible to introduce conservation farming systems to a
region in a period of about ten years. If success is to be achieved it is
essential that practices be capable of being adopted without subsidy, that
the introduction get strong support from the local administration and that
there be a vigorous extension campaign.
16. It is recommended that:
- Australia should have an explicit policy on conservation and
development assistance based on our commitment to the World
Conservation Strategy. (5.l)
- ADAB should have its focus of conservation within the appraisals
and evaluations area.(5.2)
ADAB should incorporate conservation considerations throughout the
project cycle. (5.3)
- The cost benefit guidelines provided by ADAB should be amended to
include conservation considerations. (5.4)
- ADAB should support and encourage conservation projects and should
seek to develop projects which will have a conservation impact
throughout the relevant region. (5.5)
- ADAB should cooperate with other agencies in its activities on
conservation and development. In particular we should play an active
role in OECD activities relating to environment and development.

Key TQM ideas provided the themes for this study. These themes were;
continuous improvement, shared vision, customer and process focus,
teamwork, outrageous goals and systematic data gathering. Teachers'
perceptions regarding each of these themes or key ideas were analysed by
considering the effect on them of two sets of factors. The first set consisted
of factors in educational change while the second was comprised of factors in
the culture of teaching. TQM history, principles and practices as well as the
two sets of factors related to educational change and the culture of teaching

Historically, he has played an important role but circumstances
have now changed.
The objectives of this thesis have been:
(1) to assess the value of inventions made by independent
inventors;
(2) to determine whether the government should provide
support; and
(3) if so, how?
It is not appropriate to make a judgement about the value
of independent inventors on qualitative data alone. Therefore,
attempts must be made to obtain quantitative data on the value,
in economic and social terms, of inventions of independent
inventors. The unique feature of this thesis is the survey of
members of the Inventors' Association of Australia to assess the
personal characteristics of their members, the value of
inventions made by members and the types of assistance required
by their members.
Some of the research results on the personal
characteristics of independent inventors are interesting.
- 95% are males. (This is supported by other research
data).
their educational qualifications are much higher than
the general population.
- on average, each inventor spends 8-10 hours per week
on inventions.
The survey showed that the economic value (in terms of
value of output) of inventions made by members of the Inventors'
Association of Australia is about $50m per annum and creates
about 4000 man years of employment. It is not possible to assess
what percentage of independent inventors are members of the
Inventors' Association of Australia. Estimates place this
between 20% and 50%. If this is the case, then it can be
estimated that the value of output of inventions of independent
inventors in Australia is between $100m-$260m which, in turn,
creates 7,700 - 19,000 man years of employment.
Additionally, the qualitative evidence suggests that
Australian inventors are, at the least, equal to their overseas
counterparts.
There are grounds why governments should intervene to
assist independent inventors
indivisibility: this relates to access to
information and to the large scale nature of some
inventions.
inappropriability: this refers to the externalities
or social benefits of inventions which are not
recouped by inventors through the normal market
mechanisms.
- uncertainty: independent inventors usually have a
small number of inventions; therefore it is not
possible for them to spread their risks. Large
companies and some areas of the agriculture and mining
industries have developed special mechanisms for
spreading risk.
Based on an assessment of overseas policies, an
examination of existing Australian policies and the results of
the Inventors' Association of Australia survey, the following
steps should be taken in Australia to support independent
inventors.
(1) create an environment within the community which
supports/encourages invention and innovation.
(2) develop a national innovation policy.
(3) develop an innovation finance facility. (Although
this is not in operation, steps have been taken to
provide this).

within a public sector work place undergoing significant change. A number of
major stress-producing factors in that environment were examined and data
collected of employees' perceptions of the nature of stress, changes in health status
and data gathered of stress-related compensation claims. Data was also collected
of employees' perceptions of effective strategies for coping with change from an
individual and organisational perspective.
The research design was a case study with embedded units of analysis
incorporating elements of quantitative analysis. The method was chosen to flesh
out the limited choices offered by many standard questionnaires.
A case study approach and various categories of stress-related factors were
selected measures to evaluate the perceived effects of work place change on stress
levels. The eight females and three males, aged 27&#65533;50 were each interviewed for
an hour for their perceptions of stress and reports of stress related illness,
relationship changes and other reported changes&#65533;diet, sleep, heart disease,
asthma, anxiety and headaches. Workplace changes to the Division were
analysed, Departmental claims officers were interviewed and Comcare data
analysed.
Results show participants appeared to feel or experience "stress" in a way which
they distinguished as different from feelings or experiences which were nonstressful
states and they appeared able to separate these states and ascribe to each
particular qualities. They also seemed able to identify that the stressful state
occurred in response to some form of demands. Some subjects (36%) reported
developing strategies for managing their stress.
The majority of subjects (82%) believed work place change was inevitable and a
number of subjects (45%) reported they believed implementation of change to be
poorly managed, while some subjects (36%) perceived change impacting
negatively on the work place.
On the basis of the results, it would appear that a human resource management
framework may enable more successful implementation of change in public sector
organisations.</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">organisational change</field><field name="subject">employee perception</field><field name="subject">stress</field><field name="subject">work place change</field><field name="subject">stress related illness</field><field name="subject">public sector</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060619.154654</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Digital songlines : the adaption of modern communication technology at Yuendemu, a remote Aboriginal Community in Central Australia</field><field name="creator">Buchtmann, Lydia</field><field name="description">During the early 1980s the Warlpiri at Yuendemu, a remote Aboriginal community in
Central Australia, began their own experiments in local television and radio production.
This was prior to the launch of the AUSSAT satellite in 1985 which brought broadcast
television and radio to remote Australia for the first time. There was concern amongst
remote Aboriginal communities, as well as policy makers, that the imposition of mass
media without consultation could result in permanent damage to Aboriginal culture and
language. As a result, a policy review 'Out of the Silent Land' was published in 1985 and
from that developed the Broadcasting in Remote Aboriginal Communities Scheme
(BRACS) which allowed communities to receive radio and television from the satellite.
BRACS also provided the option to turn off mainstream media and insert locally
produced material.
This study of the Warlpiri at Yuendemu has found that, since the original experiments,
they have enthusiastically used modern communication technology including radio, video
making, locally produced television, and, more recently, on-line services. The Warlpiri
have adapted rather than adopted the new technology. That is they have used modern
communications technology within existing cultural patterns to strengthen their language
and culture rather than to replace traditional practices and social structures. The Warlpiri
Media Association has inspired other remote broadcasters and is now one of eight remote
media networks that link to form a national network via the National Indigenous Media
Association of Australia.
The Warlpiri have actively adapted modern communication technology because it is to
their advantage. The new technology has been used to preserve culture and language, to
restore, and possibly improve, traditional communications and to provide employment
and other opportunities for earning income. It appeals to all age groups, especially the
elders who have retained control over broadcasts and it also provides entertainment.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Warlpiri</field><field name="subject">Yuendemu</field><field name="subject">Central Australia</field><field name="subject">remote Aboriginal communities</field><field name="subject">Broadcasting in Remote Aboriginal Communities Scheme</field><field name="subject">BRACS</field><field name="subject">local radio</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060619.162428</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sediment quality guidelines for Australian waters : a framework for development and use</field><field name="creator">Buckley, David</field><field name="description">The Australian and New Zealand Environment and Conservation Council (ANZECC) and the Agriculture and Resource Management Council of
Australia and New Zealand (ARMCANZ) have announced that the 1997
review of the Australian Water Quality Guidelines will include for the first time,
consideration of sediment quality guidelines. For this reason, it is timely to
review the methods for establishing such guidelines, and the manner in which
they could be used in managing the quality of sediments in Australian rivers,
lakes and drainage systems.
In this thesis, the problem of the development of sediment quality guidelines is
introduced and basic questions relating to the development of such guidelines
are addressed. The importance of sediment monitoring and sediment quality
assessment in aquatic ecosystem management is demonstrated, and the role of
sediment quality guidelines in the process of sediment quality assessment is
discussed. The arguments considered in this thesis are illustrated by specific
reference to the setting and use of sediment quality guidelines for heavy metal
contamination.
A number of physico-chemical factors (grain size distribution, pH, redox
potential, alkalinity and hardness, salinity, organic matter) can affect the
bioavailability and toxicity of contaminants in sediments, and these factors may
vary spatially and temporally within and between sediment deposits. Changes
in physico-chemical conditions as a result of natural or anthropogenic
processes may lead to major changes in bioavailability of sediment
contaminants. The variability of these physico-chemical factors has
ramifications for the way in which sediment quality guidelines are derived and
used.
Factors affecting the way in which toxicity is measured (test species chosen,
toxicological end-point measured, duration of test relative to life-cycle), and
toxicity data is interpreted, are also important to the development of useful
sediment quality guidelines. All of these factors must be taken into account in
deriving sediment quality guidelines for Australian conditions.
The large number of factors affecting the sensitivity and efficiency of sediment
quality guidelines means that a simple set of numerical guidelines, as has been
used in the past, is not appropriate. A multi-step assessment procedure will be
required.
Methods of setting sediment quality guidelines that have been used by
authorities in overseas jurisdictions were reviewed. Advantages and
disadvantages of the various methods were compared. None of the methods
used overseas has been shown to be applicable to Australian conditions. In the
absence of a suitable method for deriving Australian sediment quality guidelines
in the short term, the adoption of the Canadian Interim Sediment Quality
Guidelines as interim sediment quality guidelines for Australia is recommended.
Sediment quality guidelines need to be viewed in the context of the overall
environmental management process, of which they form an integral part. The
policy background to environmental management in Australia, and the
management frameworks that have been put in place to implement the policy,
are outlined. The AS/NZS/ISO 14000 series of standards for environmental
management systems provides a framework which is consistent with the
principles and objectives of environmental management in Australia. It
therefore provides an appropriate framework within which to develop and use
sediment quality guidelines.
Within the broad AS/NZS/ISO 14000 policy, a framework for the
development and use of sediment quality guidelines is proposed, which will
provide a technically and legally defensible basis for the management of aquatic
sediments in Australia, in the short term and long term. The proposed
framework involves the setting of Interim Sediment Quality Guidelines for
Australia, based on the best scientific knowledge currently available. The
framework recognises that the factors affecting the bioavailability and toxicity
of sediment contaminants are complex, and that the current level of knowledge
of sediment processes is incomplete. Therefore, a conservative approach to
setting guidelines is taken, and a highly sensitive guideline based on that used in
Canada, is proposed. The framework further recognises that this approach will
lead to over protection of the environment in some cases, so a "Decision
Tree" approach is taken. The "decision tree" allows the consideration of more
complex interactions than can be incorporated into simple numeric guidelines,
while attempting to simplify the assessment process. In keeping with the ISO
14000 series of standards for environmental management, the framework also
explicitly includes steps designed to ensure that monitoring data are regularly
collated, and analysed, and where necessary, guidelines are able to be updated
in light of new knowledge gleaned from the review process.
The proposed framework is appropriate to, and supportive of, the principles of
environmental management as set out in Australian Government policy
documents, inter governmental and international agreements, and legislation.
It provides a basis for the on-going collection of data suited to increasing our
understanding of the factors influencing the behaviour of contaminants in
sediments, and thereby lead to continual improvement in sediment quality
guidelines for use in Australian conditions.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">sediment quality guidelines</field><field name="subject">Australian waters</field><field name="subject">rivers</field><field name="subject">lakes</field><field name="subject">drainage systems</field><field name="subject">heavy metal contamination</field><field name="subject">environmental management</field><field name="subject">standards</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060619.163639</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluating curriculum proposals : towards developing a set of criteria based on the analysis of selected curriculum documents</field><field name="creator">Bullivant, Lynnette</field><field name="description">This study deals with the problem of evaluating curriculum documents
which prescribe or make recommendations for curricular change. In
1980 a number of state and national education authorities in
Australia released documents which contained proposals for
reformulating the curriculum. Several of these proposals took the
form of prescribing or recommending a core curriculum while others
opted for a whole curriculum approach to the problem of the
selection and transmission of educational knowledge. Although these
are presented as practical documents - as proposals for action -
they also contain theoretical and ideological components which are
usually understated. It is the contention of this study that the
evaluation of such proposals should not be based solely on their
pragmatic or technical aspects but that their theoretical adequacy
and links with ideology should also be taken into consideration. To
this end, four of these documents have been selected, two of each
type of proposals, and are used to provide material to develop
criteria for making evaluative decisions about the theoretical and
ideological aspects of curriculum proposals. Internal criteria,
based on an analysis of the coherence and consistency of curriculum
proposals, are derived by relating the proposals to one of two
general theories of education. External criteria derive from a
meta-critique where an attempt is made to formulate broader
propositions which recognise the existence of opposition among
various assumptions and are inclusive of those in conflict.</field><field name="date">1983</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">curriculum evaluation</field><field name="subject">core curriculum</field><field name="subject">whole of curriculum</field><field name="subject">curriculum proposals</field><field name="subject">theory</field><field name="subject">ideology</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060619.165847</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Girls and science : a study of the attitudes to science of high school students</field><field name="creator">Burfitt, Helen</field><field name="description">In a case study of over three hundred students in one Canberra high school, the attitudes to
science of boys and girls in Years 7-10 were investigated using the Test of Science-Related
Attitudes (TOSRA). From this survey population, forty students were selected and
interviewed to explore in more detail students' attitudes to science. Parents of the
interviewed students were also surveyed to explore possible relationships between
students' attitudes and parental expectations and aspirations.
For the seven areas of attitudes investigated, students had positive attitudes to science in the
areas of social implications of science, normality of scientists, attitudes to scientific enquiry
and adoption of scientific attitudes. They displayed neutral to negative attitudes in the areas
of enjoyment of science lessons, leisure interest in science and career interest in science.
There was a significant difference between boys and girls in two of the seven areas with
girls being more negative than boys to a leisure interest in science, and girls more positive
than boys towards the normality of scientists.
When analysed for year at school and achievement in science, the data indicates that older
students and those with higher grades in science generally have a more positive or less
negative attitude to science. However, as a group, Year 8 girls were more negative than
other groups about the enjoyment of their science lessons, about a leisure interest in science
and about a career interest in science.
The interviews with students revealed that in general, they liked science and their science
teachers but that they would not choose science for leisure activities or for a career. Parents
are shown to have high aspirations and somewhat lower expectations for the career
prospects of their children. Both parents and students display stereotypical views about
certain careers based on gender.
Strategies to improve the attitude to science of boys and girls are suggested. These
strategies focus on activities for teachers, parents and the students themselves.</field><field name="date">1988</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Canberra</field><field name="subject">high schools</field><field name="subject">Test of Science-Related Attitudes</field><field name="subject">TOSRA</field><field name="subject">attitudes to science</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060619.171839</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Information needs of the staff delivering higher education and TAFE courses to 'remote' Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students or Northern Australia</field><field name="creator">Burgess, Andre</field><field name="description">The present study focussed on the information needs of the academic staff of
Batchelor College.* It examined their access to and the provision of adequate and
appropriate resources for the implementation of the Diploma and Associate Diploma
level courses offered through the College. Batchelor College, an institute of tertiary
education, is situated 100 kilometres south of Darwin, Northern Territory,
Australia.
The content and the modes of delivery of Batchelor College courses are specifically
designed to be culturally and socially appropriate to Aboriginal people, particularly
those from traditionally oriented and 'remote' communities. It can only be within
this framework that informed and sensitive research can be conducted.
The main purpose of the current study was to investigate the information needs of
staff delivering higher education courses to 'remote' Aboriginal students of
Northern Australia. Six distinct areas of study emerged: 1, to identify the
information needs; 2, to analyse the information-seeking behaviour; 3, to assess the
level of satisfaction with current information sources; 4, to identify inadequacies in
the existing information seeking processes; 5, to identify constraints experienced;
and 6, to explore how future information needs may be catered for.
A mailed survey instrument was specifically designed and implemented, and it
attracted a response rate of eighty-seven percent. The population under
investigation was the academic staff of Batchelor College, and the variables of: 1,
location; 2, sex; 3, academic school; 4, designation; 5, tenure; 6, length of service;
and 7, educational background were studied in relation to the questions asked.
Results of the survey were analysed using 'Mystat: Statistical Applications',
(1990). Frequency distributions were computed to determine the number of
respondents who selected each option. A number of questions that elicited a
written response were analysed, as were the many extra comments staff members
made throughout the survey.
The study found that the academic staff of Batchelor College are most affected by
the location variable. It appears that how staff members use, regard and value the
information sources used to inform their academic practice is affected by where a
staff member is located. That is, the more isolated a staff member was, both
geographically and professionally, the more significant were the findings of use of
information sources.
The study concludes with considerations of future planning strategies that could
improve the access to and use of information. The study also identifies areas for
further research. * Batchelor College, an institute of tertiary education, is situated 100 kilometres south of Darwin,

R.</field><field name="description">The boom in data communications that started in the
1960s is a long way from abating. The early and mid 1980s
will see a new generation of digital data transmission services
come into operation that could change the ways business is
conducted. "Information management and exploitation will
change the fabric of society", according to Nicolas Mokhoff,
Associate Editor of IEEE Spectrum Magazine. Manipulated
by microelectronic, computer, radio and other electronic
disciplines, information has become a vital commodity at
the trade exchange. But unlike the prices of most commodities
today, the price for exchange of information is decreasing
because of electronics. One of the principal contributors
to this decrease has been the geosynchronous telecommunications
satellite, due to rapid advances in space and communications
technology and the resulting cost-effectiveness achieved
in applying that technology. Advances in IC technology have
made digital telephony an equal partner with analogue. The
inherent advantages of digital reliability, low cost and
smaller packaging are prompting Telecom to phase out present
equipment and expand new services with a digital hierarchy,
such as the Digital Data Service being introduced in late 1982.
Services employing advanced satellite and microwave
technology, and also the existing and upgraded telephone
systems, will have at least two things in common: they will
transmit and switch data digitally, including coded speech,
and the data will be transmitted in bursts. The technology
that may expand fastest is the second generation of
commercial communications satellites. Pier Bargellini, a
senior scientist at Comsat Laboratories, says that "without
the use of satellites as reflectors for source and data
channels, television signals
could not be shared by remote
areas, long-distance telephone services would be constricted
and the data exchange for the business world would be
hampered."
Changes in the communications industry have been so
dramatic (particularly with regard to satellites) that
government bodies (including the Australian Federal Government)
have been forced to reexamine long-standing communications
practices. 
In October 1979 the Minister for Post and
Telecommunications announced the Governments decision that
it would be in the national interest to establish a
communications satellite system for Australia. At that time,
the Minister also announced that, a Satellite Project Office
would be established within the Postal and Telecommunications
Department to set in train the planning activities necessary
for the introduction of the system. The SPO has been
operational within the Department since late 1979, and
2.
consultation of system service requirements in particular
has involved liaison with a broad spectrum of interests
including Commonwealth departments.
Figure 1 of Appendix A testifies to the
Australian Government's policy of supplying outback
communities with improved communications services
(including television) by using satellite facilities.
Very little is known about the benefits and needs
(in Australia) that a data communications satellite
system might be able to fulfil, including those needs
of the Department of Social Security. This is mainly
due to the lack of specific details about the final
configurations and costs of the separate satellite services,
which wont be known until late 1981.
This paper is , therefore, an initial but detailed
examination of the hardware and software subsystems which
constitute a domestic telecommunications satellite system.
More specifically, the paper considers the on-board
equipment of a communications satellite (the space segment -
including satellite launch and orbit characteristics, and
signal propagation delay and attenuation), and the earth
stations (the ground segment - including signal modulation,
multiple access and computer application considerations);
all as dictated by Australian geographical, economic and
communications traffic density characteristics. The paper
then considers some of the possible methods Australian
corporations and government departments may adopt to
utilise satellite communications links, particularly
for data communications.
A second paper will re-examine the situation by
applying the specific facilities and costs, when they are
known (these will be announced by the Satellite Project
Office after contracts for the space and ground segments
have been let), to a large, low-traffic, interactive
multipoint network such as that of the Department of
Social Security.</field><field name="date">1981</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">satellite system</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">geosynchronous telecommunications satellite</field><field name="subject">digital communication</field><field name="subject">Australian Gederal Government</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060622.121401</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Writing in the university : faculty expectations and overseas tudents' performance</field><field name="creator">Bush, Denise</field><field name="description">Two surveys were conducted at the University of Canberra
in 1992 to seek the views of faculty on issues regarding
academic writing. The first survey sought to ascertain what
criteria faculty employ when marking student writing. It
asked faculty to indicate the importance of certain key features
in the writing of university students. These key features were:
Content, Argument, Style, Organisation, Communicative Ability,
Vocabulary, Use of Literature and Punctuation. Faculty were
requested to rank the importance of aspects of each of the nine
key features.
The second survey asked faculty to assess an actual
assignment written by an overseas student, using the structure
of the nine key features of writing as above. Faculty were
invited to indicate the strengths and weaknesses of the
assignment which they were assessing.
The aim of the surveys was to better inform teachers of English for Academic Purposes (EAP) classes, who prepare
overseas students for study at university. EAP teachers need
to know the expectations of faculty, in order to give overseas
students a realistic view of what faculty expect from their
assignments and the kinds of. weaknesses which faculty find in
overseas students' writing.
The survey found that content-related features such as
Content, Argument, Organisation and Communicative Ability
were considered more important than form features such as
Punctuation, Grammar, Style and Vocabulary. Use of Literature
was found to be a very important feature in some faculties but
not in all. Surprisingly, Style was the feature which evoked the
greatest variety of responses from faculty; however, in general
faculty agreed that Style had to be appropriate to the topic or
task, rather than there being a set format for academic writing.
From a factor analysis of data, four underlying principles
for academic writing were derived. These principles were:
relevance, appropriacy, accuracy and clarity. Thus, academic
writing, according to the faculty surveyed, should be:
1) relevant to the topic and to the internal argument of the
assigment;
2) appropriate in the style, tone and use of literature;
3) accurate in its vocabulary, grammar and referencing system.
4) clear in its argument and organisation of ideas.
For the most part, faculty responded favourably to the
overseas student assignments, which were assessed in the
second questionnaire. Faculty indicated that the main
weakness in overseas student writing was in their argument.
The surveys also found differences between different
Faculties in the importance they place on these key features.
It was postulated that the Science Faculties (Applied Science,
Environmental Design and Information Science and
Engineering) would be fairly similar in their views on writing,
as would the Humanities Faculties (Communication, Education
and Management). This was found to be only partly true. The
views of Information Science and Engineering faculty were
found to be more similar in many of their attitudes to the
views of the Humanities faculty. However, in some ways, their
views were unique and unlike any other Faculty. In particular.
Information Science and Engineering faculty place little
emphasis on writing as a method of assessment and, perhaps
as a consequence, even less on the use of literature in writing
From the survey, it also appeared that, in general, faculty
make some allowances for the fact that overseas students are
L2 speakers. They tend to overlook mechanical errors so long
as the content is acceptable.</field><field name="date">1993</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">academic writing</field><field name="subject">overseas students</field><field name="subject">English for Academic Purposes</field><field name="subject">EAP</field><field name="subject">teachers</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060622.132041</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Curriculum work : post modern positions and problematics : a personal perspective</field><field name="creator">Butler, Elaine</field><field name="description">This thesis presents an interrogation of curriculum practices and positionings, over
time, of a feminist educator and curriculum worker seeking to centre gender and
subjugated knowledges in a curriculum framework with the potential for
transformative outcomes. The interrogation offers an opportunity to consider
discourses in operation, to frame curriculum and pedagogy as sites of discursive
struggle around knowledges, gender and power.
The thesis, presented as a critical narrative, interweaves theories and theoretical ideas
from four key areas: post modernism and post structuralism; feminism/s; education
and curriculum, and critical social sciences, including critical theory. Interpretative
feminist praxis is employed as the methodological approach.
Central to the investigation is a curriculum project undertaken in Papua New Guinea
(the Goroka Curriculum Project). This Project which is positioned as a case study,
provides text for conceptual and contextual interrogation of a specific site of
curriculum work, and a corrective moment in which the limitations of the writer's
endeavours and position/s of advantage are acknowledged.
Curriculum positionings described as oppositional are challenged as a result of the
lack of attention to gender by radical and critical theorists. Further, the disjuncture
between such theorising, and the development of curriculum models to inform
oppositional work is made overt and problematic.
Curriculum models and practices associated with the work of traditional empiricist
approaches found to be dominant in Papua New Guinea, reify western intellectual
endeavours to the disadvantage of indigenous and women's knowledges and
knowledge practices. This naturalisation is framed as an example of a meta narrative
in education, whereby the discursive practices associated with traditional / rational
curriculum models both colonise the endeavours of curriculum workers, and position
learners as colonised subjects. A central outcome of the traditional/rational model is
the inherent positioning of such individuals and groups as marginalised, devalued
Other. Such curriculum work is framed as a technology of governance, privileging
attempts to establish order and homogeneity in an increasingly disorderly and
fragmented world.
The investigation by the curriculum writer of her theory/practice leads to recognition
of oppositional work as a site of power, that also has the potential to 'oppress',
extending the colonial project. Following this, the thesis investigates transformative
curriculum work as problematic potentiality, questioning what the work of a feminist
curriculum writer in a post modern world is to do and to be.
While acknowledging there are no innocent discourses of liberation, the potential of
the 'courage to know', to attend to pedagogical ethics and ethics of self, and
acknowledge the messy, contradictory and deeply political work of curriculum design
are posited. An emergent notion of curriculum work as textual practice, within a
multi-dimensional framework that conceptualises curriculum as representation is
advanced.</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">curriculum</field><field name="subject">feminism</field><field name="subject">post modernism</field><field name="subject">critical social sciences</field><field name="subject">Goroka Curriculum Project</field><field name="subject">Papua New Guinea</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060622.133222</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Music as a cognitive developing activity : implications for learning and for the learning disabled child</field><field name="creator">Bygrave, Patricia</field><field name="description">Various cognitive learning theories have been examined for the purpose of considering music
as an activity developing cognitive processes.
It was felt that an exploration of these
theories could offer insights into how music
can be used to demonstrate cognitive
development in learning and in children with
learning disabilities. In an attempt to
illustrate the relationship between music and
cognition, concepts in the theories of Piaget,
the Neo-Piagetians (Case, Pascaul-Leone, Biggs
and Collis), Bruner, Ausubel, Vygotsky, Luria
and Leont'ev have been discussed in association
with music activities. It is argued that
music can be identified as a cognitive activity
and applied to learning and to learning
disabilities through recognised special
education approaches; these include
perceptual-motor, multi-sensory, languagedevelopment
related, developmental and
behavioural.
The theories of Vygotsky, Luria and Leont'ev -
the 'troika' - are considered in greater
detail. Their theories, although focussing on
concepts of language in cognitive development,
appear to offer a means for the wider
application of music to cognitive development.
Vygotsky's developmental hierarchy, Luria's
brain functional system, and Leont'ev's theory
of activity have been amalgamated into a
theoretical framework demonstrating the
processing of information through music
activity leading to cognitive development.
This framework provides for an investigation
into learning capacities and learning
potential, relevant to cognitive development in
learning and in the learning disabled child.</field><field name="date">1985</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cognitive development</field><field name="subject">music</field><field name="subject">learning disabilities</field><field name="subject">special education</field><field name="subject">troika</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060622.143654</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Online searchers in Australia : backgrounds, experience, attitudes, behaviours, styles and satisfaction</field><field name="creator">Byrne, Alex</field><field name="description">Online searchers in Australia were studied through six sets

satisfied with their searches, and favoured adaptability but
not preplanning. Those whose organisations levied charges
appeared to search less often and to have less faith in
controlled vocabularies. A minority with computational
backgrounds tended to have more searching experience.
Many respondents searched infrequently and had conducted low
total numbers of searches. Those searching more often were
less cost conscious, and more in favour of trial-and-error
and reviewing retrieved titles. Searchers who had conducted
more searches favoured trial-and-error , browsing and
reviewing retrieved titles.
Controlled vocabularies, adaptability (related to a
disinclination to review retrieved titles), trial-and-error
and browsing were favoured . Fidel's conceptualist style
tended to be adopted by those favouring trial-and-error. Her

has grown in several major parts of civilized jurisdictions. The thrust of the study was to
evaluate the past, present and the future of a particular type of action known in Corporate
Law under the umbrella of shareholder remedies - the 'Derivative Action' with emphasis
to develop the law in one jurisdiction profiting from another. The research thus reveals
how, when and where the so called action originated, the initial effects these actions had on
the corporate world including shareholders, companies and related persons natural or
juristic. Though much has been written by way of books, treatises and articles and several
researches have dealt with the common topic shareholder remedies in its broad perspect,
there is no separate study carried out on this topic in its global context with a comparative
focus. This study has therefore given me the drive, initiative and courage to look at the
conceptual view or the macro view of the so called 'Derivative Action' with of course
special emphasis on the Australian and Sri Lankan jurisdictions in its micro aspects. This, I
believe is the first time anyone has undertaken such a task. The study thus travels through
distant roads of common law action to the statutory form of the action in the relevant
jurisdictions and finds it driving with much purpose in jurisdictions such as Australia and
Sri Lanka which are both in the transitional era from the common law action to the
statutory action.
The research is based on the collection of material namely, case law - Australian, Sri
Lankan and international on the matters in issue, Legal treatises on the subject matter local
and international, Law reform material - Australian, Sri Lankan and international on the
topic, Bills and Statutes available on the topic in Australia, Sri Lanka and other countries.
I have met resource personnel with regard to Law Reform in several jurisdictions on the
matters in issue and visited the Australian Stock Exchange and the Colombo Stock
Exchange.
The research findings depend mainly on the electronic data available in addition to
resources available at the University of Canberra, the Australian National University,
Colombo Law Library, The Colombo Law Society Library and the Sri Lanka Supreme
Court Judges' Chambers Library and the Sri Lanka Attorney General's Department
Library. Visits to the McGill University in Montreal, Canada and the corporate law sector
in New Zealand, including Universities and Law Offices in Christchurch and Auckland too
has helped me considerably in the process.
Review of the literature of the proposed statutory Derivative Action in Australia and the
proposed statutory Derivative Action in Sri Lanka, are based mainly on; Enforcement of
the duties of directors and officers of a company by means of a statutory derivative action
(Report No. 12) Companies and Securities Law Review Committee. (November 1990.),
Corporate Practices and the Rights of Shareholders (Report of the House of
Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs) Parliament of
the Commonwealth of Australia. (November 1991.), Report on A Statutory Derivative
Action Companies and Securities Advisory Committee. (July 1993.), Corporate Law
Economic Reform Program (CLERP) Proposal Paper No 3 (1997), the CLERP draft
legislative provisions (1998), Australian case law on the application of the common law
Derivative Action, both in the High Court and in individual States and Australian articles
on Derivative Action as a common law remedy and on the introduction of the statutory
action. In the Sri Lankan context, the proposals in Sri Lanka for the statutory Derivative
Action and the case law in Sri Lanka on the application of the common law remedy has
been referred to. Other literature include, material available on the Canadian formula of
Derivative Action, including Statutes, Rules, case law, articles and other relevant data,
material available on the Derivative Actions in the United States, material available in New
Zealand on Derivative Actions, material available in England on Derivative Actions,
namely on the common law approach, case law, articles, Bills, Rules and other connected
material, Statutes on Derivative Actions in other jurisdictions at present and Hong Kong
proposals for a statutory Derivative Action, to name some.
The aforesaid material and the review of the same have assisted the study as follows:
-To place the past, present and the future of the common law Derivative Action.
-Examine the objectives of the Derivative Action.
-The operation of the common law aspects of the action.
-The benefits of the statutory form of the action.
-Experiences of other countries in the recent past on the subject.
-The Australian reform process presently underway.
-The best experiences in Australia with regard to case law.
-To evaluate whether the remedy should be limited to fraud on the minority or whether it
should be extended further even to negligence.
-How best Sri Lanka could benefit from the Australian formula of the statutory form of the
action.
-To evaluate whether the proposed model of the statutory action in Sri Lanka is adequate in
view of the Australian and other accepted formulae on the subject.
-Whether the common law action should be expressly abolished in Sri Lanka.
-Consider the possible introduction of the best methods to Sri Lanka.
Finally, the research speaks for itself the need for a statutory Derivative Action for Sri
Lanka in the future, to be an improvement on the Canadian, New Zealand and Australian

education in our society is the exemplification of a number of attitudes
about humanity and life in general. Perceptions about the place of tertiary or postcompulsory
education in the life of the ordinary person have changed along with a
broader sweep of changes in the way people view themselves in relations to the
world. The meaning of education in general and in particular, that of tertiary or postcompulsory
education in the life of people today occupies a very different one to that
of as little as forty or thirty years ago. The recent movements in the policies and
processes surrounding the structure, form and purpose of higher education in
Australia signifies to some extent at least the depth of these shifts in perceptions.
In the field of social welfare education changes in political and social attitudes have led
to calls for increased accountability in standards of practice in both service delivery
and professional education, yet this call has come at a time of change in the cultural
climate where there is decreasing clarity about what is expected of social welfare as a
service, and of education for professional practice in the area.
This thesis contends that the practice of and education for social work and social
welfare stand in an invidious position in the current society in that practitioners and
teachers, agencies and universities are being called on to be more accountable both
philosophically and pragmatically, but that at the same time as this call for
accountability presses upon the profession, questions are also being asked about the
value basis of professional practice. Criticisms are being levied at the profession
some suggesting that it is ideologically bound and ineffective in dealing with social
problems seen to be within its scope of contribution to society. With justification these
same criticism are being aimed at social work and welfare training programs with
suggestions that contend that the education of people to work in the social welfare
sector is at a cross-roads. Unless a reassessment of the goals and purposes of
education for this field takes place it may lose all social status and relevance, yet there
are those who suggest that change is long overdue and that there has been little change
in the philosophy and practice of social welfare education
The thesis has a primary contention that training people to work as social workers and
other professional providers of social welfare in the current society is being placed
under the microscope as a consequence of a number of movements in educational and
political thought that have had their culmination in the competency movement that has
impacted on both tertiary education, the professions and the industries.
The institutions in which this training or education takes place have been changed in
form and function particularly since 1989, following the Dawkins restructuring of the
tertiary education sector and the account of these changes provides a backdrop for the
story about social welfare education in Australia.
These changes have included the construction of a national training platform with the
espoused intention of formulating a seamless web of credentialling linking schools,
the workplace, industry based training, DeTAFE and universities.
The introduction of Competency Based Education, where training is asked to
demonstrate a higher level of accountability and transparency than has been the case in
the past, and the introduction of higher, sharper demands for effectiveness and
relevance have shaken the universities out of comfortable complacency.
In particular the competency movement has placed demands on the professions to
demonstrate that they are able to describe their skills, roles and functions in accessible
and assessable terms. This demand has also been placed on the social welfare
profession. The requirement for the social welfare profession to formulate
competencies has thrown into sharp relief an ideologically bound framework of
practice that is seen to be out of touch with the needs of the current society, and this
has had direct relevance for the education programs preparing people to practice in
these areas.
Chapter One focuses on views of knowledge and education and goes on to critique the
changes in higher education that have occurred over the last half-century in Australia
in general and in South Australia in particular, specifically in reference to the
programs for educating social welfare workers. This chapter is largely historical, but
this history is told with more of an appreciation of the spectacle of history's passing
or recycling parade rather than of social progress.
Chapter Two addresses the impact and significance of the structural and policy
changes within the higher education sector with a particular focus on the competency
movement as a demonstration of one of the currently perceived purposes of
education.
Chapter Three explores responses to the competency movement as further indicators
of the views about the purposes of higher education in general and their relevance to
those teaching with the social work and social welfare programs.
Chapter Four locates voices in the discourse about the social welfare field, the type of
work involved in the area, the sort of training needed, and the dilemmas inherent in
the profession in the current society. This chapter highlights the need for a consensus
position to support the formulation of standards for practice as implied in the design
of competencies, and the ramifications of the lack of such consensus.
Chapter Five displays the state of disarray in the profession through the analysis of
the draft competencies produced so far, where lack of vision and consensus are seen,
in the final reckoning, as the stumbling blocks to future clarity of purpose. Of any
profession, social welfare work is one of the most difficult to put into competency based
form due to both the nature of the work and the lack of a consensus view of its
primary goals and purposes, yet it is essential that this can be achieved given the
impactful and intrusive nature of the work, and the push for accountability implicit in
the competency movement.
The thesis concludes with a statement of hope that clearer standards for practice can be
formulated and that social welfare education and practice can re-configure to
contribute relevantly to the current society.</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">tertiary education</field><field name="subject">social welfare education</field><field name="subject">social workers</field><field name="subject">competency based education</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060623.152738</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A case study of the amalgamation of the Broadland House Chirch of England Girls' Grammar School and the Launceston Church Grammar School : a management of change process</field><field name="creator">Campbell, John Robert</field><field name="description">The amalgamation of Broadland House C.E.G.G.S. and the
Launceston Church Grammar School was announced, as a fait
accompli, in April 1982. The merger was to be in two stages;
the separate operation of both schools under the one
Headmaster from June 1982 and the completely merged schools
from the beginning of 1983.
Both Broadland House and the Launceston Grammar claim to
be the oldest continuing schools in Australia, having been
founded in 1845 and 1846 respectively. The fact that many
families had been involved with either or both schools for
four or five generations led to period of bitter conflict and
resistance to change, which was largely overcome by the end
of the first year of operation.
Diminishing enrolments at both schools had been brought
about largely through the rural recession in Tasmania during
the 1960's, together with the provision of better school
facilities and roads in the rural areas of Tasmania. The
Launceston Church Grammar had become co-educational in 1972,
largely as a means of survival. Previous approaches to
Broadland House, by the Grammar School, to consider
amalgamation had been rejected.
This study endeavours to determine the strategies which
led to the almost total acceptance of the amalgamation
between the Broadland House Church of England Girls Grammar
School and the Launceston Church Grammar School, and to
explain those strategies through reference to the literature
on the management of change. This involved rationalising
resources, setting up new academic courses, providing
physical facilities, considering the traditions of both
schools, the gaining of financial, support and of developing
acceptance of the change within the school community and
within the community at large.
The study follows the period covering the eight months
of preparation prior to the amalgamation together with its
first 5 years of operation, during which time the School has
grown considerably and enjoys wide confidence and support.
As amalgamations are occurring more regularly across the
nation, it is hoped that the lessons learned through this
educational innovation will be of benefit to others.</field><field name="date">1987</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Broadland House Chirch of England Girls' Grammar School</field><field name="subject">Launceston Church Grammar School</field><field name="subject">school amalgamation</field><field name="subject">change processes</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060623.160001</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of a curriculum in supervision for A.C.T. TAFE</field><field name="creator">Cameron, Patricia</field><field name="description">It had been apparent for some time that the supervision course taught by
ACT TAFE (based on the 1970 NSW curriculum) was not meeting the training
needs of ACT supervisors. This study is a detailed account of how the
new curriculum in supervision was developed.
The first section is a literature survey directed toward the most
relevant problems concerning supervision: the duties and
responsibilities of supervisors and their training. The literature
shows how the perception of a supervisor has changed from that of a
craftsman in charge of men in an assembly plant to that of a first-line
or sub-manager, technical specialist or workgroup coordinator working
with men and women in white collar occupations. Training research was
surveyed in the areas of training needs assessment, curriculum,
management development and evaluation. From these and further studies
specifically on supervision courses in TAFE (the only post-secondary
provider of training in this area), it was concluded that its piecemeal
and haphazardly developed courses were unlikely to fulfil supervisors'
training needs or gain the acceptance of employers.
The second part of the field study is a survey of the opinions of ACT
supervision students, supervisors and managers on their training needs
in supervision. The techniques used were structured interviews with
students and a postal questionnaire to managers and supervisors in the
public and private sectors.
Finally, the curriculum was formulated using results from the two
previous sections. Although the response rate from the postal survey
was low, the results were nevertheless useful, confirming the data
obtained from past students. In the final analysis, three factors
contributed almost equally to the design of the curriculum: ideas and
findings in the literature, the surveys, and my own experience as a
supervisor, manager and teacher.</field><field name="date">1985</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">supervision course</field><field name="subject">supervisors</field><field name="subject">Australian Capital Territory</field><field name="subject">ACT</field><field name="subject">TAFE</field><field name="subject">curriculum</field><field name="subject">supervision students</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060623.161003</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cross-age tutoring : an effective leadership alternative for sports skills</field><field name="creator">Campbell, Heather</field><field name="description">The purpose of the present study was to determine the effect of cross-age tutoring upon
leadership style and self-esteem for the tutors, and children's attitudes toward physical activity
and motivation to participate in sport for primary school children. Although the process of
peer tutoring and/or cross-age tutoring is not a new concept, this form of transmission of
information and skill within the educational sporting environment in Australia, and particularly
in the A.C.T, is relatively new, and is an area which has received very little empirical attention.
Comparisons between the three cross-age tutoring programs were made in terms of primary
school students' attitudes toward physical activity and motivation to participate in sport, as
well as leadership style and self-esteem for the tutors.
Four hundred and eighty-eight primary school students (7 to 12 years of age) were
administered an adaptation of Gill, Gross, &amp; Huddleston's (1982) Participation Motivation
Questionnaire; and Schutz, Smoll, &amp; Wood's (1985) Children's Attitudes Towards Physical
Activity Inventory, both before the program and again at the end of the program.
Further, one hundred and twenty-six secondary students (from Years 9 &amp; 10) were
administered an adaptation of Coopersmith's (1967) Self-Esteem Inventory; and a modified
version of Chelladurai's (1980) Leadership Scale for Sports.
A modified questionnaire from Clough &amp; Traill's (1992) Sportsfun program evaluation was
designed and implemented to measure attitudes about participating in sporting activities, as
well as to obtain ideas about changes or benefits for each group from their viewpoint. This
evaluation sheet was given to the tutors and tutees following the completion of the program
Statistical analyses revealed that involvement in cross-age tutoring programs in the field of
sport and physical education did not provide significant results in the areas of self-esteem or
leadership style for the tutors, or in the areas of attitudes towards physical activity or
participation motivation for the tutees. In other words, these results indicated that the act of
participation in a cross-age tutoring program in sport and physical activity did not enhance and
develop these attributes for either the tutors or the tutees. Conversely, though, the results did
not reveal significant outcomes to indicate that participation in a cross-age tutoring program
would lower or negatively affect the existing levels of self-esteem, leadership behaviour,
attitudes towards physical activity or motivation to participate in sporting activities for the
tutors or tutees.
However, from the qualitative data obtained during the interview questionnaire following
participation in the cross-age tutoring programs, it could be concluded that cross-age tutoring
programs in the area of sport and physical education have merit because they seem to serve
different needs for the different groups of people involved in them, including the tutors, tutees,
teachers and participating schools. By providing cross-age tutoring programs in sport, children
and tutors have the opportunity to develop sports skills and enhance leadership/coaching
abilities which are consistent with the participant's individual personalities and aspirations.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cross-age tutoring</field><field name="subject">leadership style</field><field name="subject">tutors</field><field name="subject">self-esteem</field><field name="subject">sporrts skills</field><field name="subject">physical education</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060623.161717</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Trinity : a study of the amalgamation of St. Mary's College and Marist Brothers' St. Joseph's High School Lismore 1965-1985</field><field name="creator">Cannane, Mary</field><field name="description">The amalagamation of St. Mary's College and St. Joseph's High
School, Lismore was a process that began in 1965 when a decision was
made to combine Senior classes for the first Higher School Certificate
curriculum. There was no thought of amalgamation in 1965 but the
decision made then lead to the developments of 1977.
Increasing enrolments and the need for a building programme set
the scene for a merger of Junior classes and the introduction of
coeducation throughout the schools. This process extended from 1977
to 1981. It was a period of conflict and resistance to change but it
laid the foundation for the complete amalgamation of the schools to
form Trinity Catholic College in 1985.
The amalgamation process provides a study of decision-making in a
Catholic school context. Changes in the Church, Catholic schools and
Religious Orders are reflected in the changes in the way that
decisions were made at the three key-points in the story.
The study draws attention to the fact that in amalgamations of
schools much of the planning is done in terms of the present schools
rather than for the new school which is always twice as large and much
more complex. The non-educational aspects of amalgamation are also
considered because they are a time-consuming but important part of the
planning.
This study shows the importance of rituals in laying the old
schools to rest so that the new school may come into being. A visible
indication that things are different is essential when the students,
staff and buildings remain as they had been.
Since amalgamations are becoming more common as student numbers
decline some lessons learned over the past twenty years are recorded
so that others may benefit from them.</field><field name="date">1985</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">St. Mary's College</field><field name="subject">St. Joseph's High School</field><field name="subject">Lismore</field><field name="subject">school amalgamaltions</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060626.125829</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Clinician adherence to

for Post Traumatic Stress Disorder</field><field name="creator">Byron, Holly</field><field name="description">The clinical adherence to and combination of methods with EMDR to
treat PTSD has not been explored. This is of some concern as 27 000
clinicians are trained in EMDR globally. This exploratory study gained
information on Australian trained EMDR clinicians' adherence to EMDR,
and the methods they combined with EMDR to treat PTSD. Survey
responses from 126 clinicians were analysed using predominantly
descriptive statistics.
The findings of this study showed that the majority of respondents
perceived that they closely adhered to the standard EMDR treatment.
However, respondents reported adhering more closely to the phases than
the steps of EMDR. Statistically significant findings showed that more
experienced EMDR level 1 clinicians were more likely to add steps and
phases to EMDR, and to change the standard sequence of steps. Clinicians
with greater years of experience were also more likely to change the
standard sequence of steps. In addition, more experienced EMDR level 2
clinicians, were less likely to educate their clients about PTSD. Almost all
respondents combined EMDR with other methods to treat PTSD. Combined
methods included CBT, hypnosis / relaxation, system / solution focused
methods and exposure.
This research has contributed to theory and practice by uncovering
that clinicians appear to use EMDR differently to researchers, by changing
EMDR to meet client needs, combining EMDR with other methods and

the Australian Capital Territory (Campbell Report, 1972) led to
far-reaching changes in senior secondary education. Hawker College,
opened in 1976, is one of eight resulting government secondary
colleges. The writer, a member of the Committee, has been Assistant
Principal (Curriculum) at Hawker since its inception. This field
study examines the dynamics, nature and achievements of curriculum
change at Hawker, from the planning year in 1975, to 1980. Data
includes student surveys and interviews; discussions with teachers,
administrators and counsellors; college curriculum documents; and
the writer's own observations.
The Campbell Report's educational philosophy was eclectic, and
"progressive". Strengths and weaknesses of the Working Committee's
analyses and recommendations are assessed. Seven curriculum aims
"clusters" are synthesized: four concerned with individual development,
and three with the student as an effective, contributing member of
society.
ACT systemic strategies and structures fostered and sustained
purposeful curriculum innovation, despite some problems and shortcomings.
In the optimistic, idealistic climate of 1975, enthusiastic,
pre-identified teachers planned Hawker's curriculum, often co-operating
with staff of other colleges. Course writers' aims were highly
congruent with those of the Campbell Committee. Teachers of some
subjects used course models from overseas and interstate. Others
developed ideas quite innovative for Australia as a whole, and sometimes
without known precedent anywhere.
Almost all the curriculum aims espoused by the Campbell Report
are reflected in written or "unwritten" course aims. In content,
a core of basic subjects are very similar to those offered for the
NSW HSC. Others offer students either greater breadth or depth than
does the NSW curriculum, or attend to the affective and psychomotor
domains. Most teachers had modified their pedagogy, moving to a
more progressive style.
Hawker has had significant success in promoting students'
individual 'development. It has been markedly less successful in
preparing students to function within, and contribute to, society.
The opening of ACT secondary colleges coincided with widespread
social innovation and with changes in educational administration,
funding, staffing structures and teacher education. All these
created a favorable milieu for curriculum innovation. By the early
1980s, teacher weariness, some disillusionment, and social, political
and administrative changes were apparent. These have slowed the
rate of educational change and caused Hawker teachers to re-evaluate
their aims, course content, and methods.</field><field name="date">1980</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Hawker College</field><field name="subject">Australian Capital Territory</field><field name="subject">ACT</field><field name="subject">Campbell Report</field><field name="subject">curriculum change</field><field name="subject">curriculum innovation</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060627.132557</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Towards outcome evaluation : a study of public relations evaluation in the Australian Federal Government, 1995</field><field name="creator">Charlton, Andrea</field><field name="description">The Australian Federal government has well-defined guidelines for undertaking

weeks after the call to assess crisis counselling outcomes in affect,
identification of the problem and action taken, and client equilibrium.
Repeated measures of the 'perceptual concordance' of counsellor and client
were taken over a period of six weeks, assessing levels of concordance
between client and counsellor about perceptions of counselling, and client
equilibrium. The sufficiency of a single counselling session was also
assessed.
'Perceptual concordance' was suggested by reduced client stress, high levels
of agreement between client and counsellor in the identification of the
problem and agreed action, and satisfaction with the counselling. Positive
indicators of restored client equilibrium included a maintenance of lower
stress levels, changes in behaviour, improvement in perceptions of the
seriousness of the problem, satisfaction with life and with the counselling.
Further research of equilibrium as a concept, and an indicator of crisis
resolution is warranted. The sufficiency of a single session of counselling
was supported by 56% of clients.
The variety of services used by clients as an outcome of the counselling
suggests that it could be beneficial for telephone counselling agencies to
offer a follow-up call. Verifying the agreed action and assessing equilibrium
could be useful indicators of effective telephone counselling.</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">telephone counselling</field><field name="subject">crisis counselling</field><field name="subject">perceptual concordance</field><field name="subject">equilibrium</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060628.122932</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Problems for teachers in the processes of educational change : an application of Berstein's theory of integrated and collection codes to the case of a new open space high school</field><field name="creator">Cashman, Maureen</field><field name="description">The context in which open space high schools were pioneered
in the ACT is examined in the light of Basil Bernstein's
(1971) theory of the reasons for changes in curricula and
of the organisational conditions necessary for the changes
which he considers to be taking place.
The context which is examined is derived from analyses of
the perspectives and views of the Australian Schools
Commission, of the planners of the new design high schools
in the ACT, of the Campbell Committee, which provided
the rationale for the restructuring of the ACT secondary
school system, and of the Principal and teachers of one of
the original open space high schools in the ACT.
From the analysis of the context of the establishment of a
specific open space high school, "Windy Hill", a number of
factors are seen to be significant in the process of
educational change. In particular, it is claimed that any
theoretical perspective on the reasons and conditions for
educational change, if it is to have much influence on
the change process, must take into account the perspectives
of the practitioners in schools. It must also take into
account the complexity of events which affect the process of
educational change in systems and in schools.
The relationship between imposed organisational structures
and the curricular goals of schools is examined. It is
claimed that changes to administrative structures must
emerge from the existing aims of the system and
the institution, rather than be imposed in order to
effect curricular changes.
Assumptions about the nature of educational change, made
by the planners for the open space high schools in the ACT,
are identified and related to the problems perceived by
the Principal and teachers at "Windy Hill". From this
analysis is derived a set of features of school settings
which need to be considered when innovations in education
are being contemplated.
These features of the process of educational change are
used to generate a number of recommendations which apply
to the adoption and development of changes in education
systems and schools.</field><field name="date">1982</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">open space schools</field><field name="subject">Australian Capital Territory</field><field name="subject">ACT</field><field name="subject">Basil Bernstein</field><field name="subject">Campbell Committee</field><field name="subject">educational change</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060628.124043</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Background studies for Vietnamese students of English</field><field name="creator">Cat, Bui Van</field><field name="description">Recent years have witnessed many developments in
the use of the communicative approach in language
teaching. This approach aims at developing students'
ability to communicate with native speakers of the
target language. To achieve this ability, students
are required to have not only linguistic competence
but also communicative competence. That is why the
students need not only the linguistic knowledge but
also the background knowledge of the culture in which
the language is spoken.
Language is a part of culture. Cultural differences
always cause problems for speakers of
different cultures while communicating. Therefore,
the " learning of a second culture is often a part
of the learning of a second language " (Brown, 1980:
242 ) .
Background Studies, including culture, used to
be neglected or taught improperly in the curriculum
of the Hanoi Foreign Languages College. In consequence,
Vietnamese E.F.L students at the College have a poor
background knowledge of the English speaking countries
and their people's patterned ways of life. This causes
difficulties for them when communicating with native
speakers of English, even when they are studying
at the College where culture-based textbooks and
materials are commonly used.
Therefore, Background Studies, including
culture, must be seen as a separate and indispensable
component of the curriculum of the College
which aims at providing the students with the
background knowledge of English speaking countries
and with an awareness of their people's ways of
life, their customs and habits and so on. Various
techniques for the teaching of this subject are

Each subject underwent a semi-structured interview at admission to the Program, and
then at three and sixth months or on discharge with concurrent Psychometric testing.
Quantitative and qualitative data were compared with information from "significant
others" and unit staff reports to determine changes in subjects' behaviours over the
study period.
To consider any effects of the Program on psychiatric re-admissions, relevant data
dating back to 1980 from both regional admitting centres were examined for patients
who were identified as having had multiple re-admission for psychiatric care as well as
a minimum of twenty-four days attendance at the Day Program ( n = 73 ).
The results indicated a trend towards improved quality of life, improvement in selfcare,
social supports, ability to form relationships and in the quality of family
relationships. Reduction in number and intensity of symptoms, and improvement in
coping skills was reported for 88% of subjects. Subjects were found to agree in their
perception of the most and least helpful elements of the Program.
Re-admission data showed that the Program was most beneficial for number of
admissions, rate of admissions, length of stay and rate of length of stay for the
diagnostic group of Depressions and for the group as a whole. There were also
positive effects in some of these areas for the diagnostic groups of Anxiety Disorders

1. To examine the explanatory power of educational
theory as a means of illuminating a particular
educational practice.
2. To examine the potential for practice to
provide a critique of educational theory and
thus contribute towards the generation of new
theoretical perspectives.
I do this by focusing on the possible failure of a
particular opposition movement, to wit the progressive
movement in Victorian secondary schools 1966-1976. I
investigate the limits and possibilities of such a
movement with reference to ideal conditions.
There are 3 phases to this investigation:
1. a descriptive account of the progressive movement
which attempts to establish its status as an
oppositional movement and its context.
2. an internal analysis of its themes, intentions and
practices according to the criteria of consistency
and coherence .
3. an external analysis which takes up the
inconsistencies or contradictions as problems in need
of interpretation. Selected educational theories and
studies, such as those developed by Bowles and
Gintis, Sharp, Willis and Hinkson will be examined
both for their power to account for the particular
contradictions that emerged and their ability to
illuminate broader processes of constraint which work
both in and through schooling. The purpose of such
an analysis is to heighten our understanding of
contemporary educational theory and practice through
a sharper perspective of the immediate past, drawing
on, and learning from, both the mistakes and insights
of the past.
I offer in conclusion, some provisional remarks for use in
similar situations in the future.

a form of conceptual analysis using texts and theoretical

R.</field><field name="description">In 1976, the Indonesian government began to implement
a new curriculum known as Curriculum 75. This was
intended for all government primary, junior secondary
and senior secondary schools. This field study, which
is written for non-Indonesian readers, examines the
Social Science component of Curriculum 75 using elements
of the Stake model of curriculum evaluation. The purpose
of the evaluation is to show, within the Stake model,
the intended antecedents, transactions and outcomes of
the Social Science Curriculum; that is, the specifications
of the curriculum documents and associated texts before
implementation in the classroom. The principal argument
of this evaluation is that the worth of the curriculum
is discovered in the elements of control which are manifest
in intentions.
This evaluation selects three issues for closer examination
and evaluation; economic development, political culture
and the world view which are portrayed in the curriculum.
This closer examination reveals that knowledge of economic
development is emphasised more than knowledge of political
culture. In turn, knowledge of the the world outside and
beyond Indonesia which constitute the world view is the
least important of the three issues, and particularly at
the primary level receives very little attention whatsoever.
The specific outcomes of the Social Science Curriculum show
that the type of knowledge which is emphasised is cognitive
understanding rather than the formation of attitudes and
values. Pupils are expected to learn factual knowledge
rather than develop personal and social values.
The central theme or argument which this evaluation pursues
is the notion of curriculum control. Curriculum 75 is
the creation of an educational bureaucracy within a
bureaucratic state. When understood within the context of
the Jackson critique of contemporary Indonesia, curriculum
is a bureaucratic function of the state. A principal
element of that function is the exercising of control which,
for the purpose of this field study, is revealed in a
bureaucratic and a curriculum form. The curriculum form of
control is the central notion in this evaluation. For the
Social Science Curriculum to be successful in the Indonesian
classroom, the Curriculum should specify contents and methods
in such prescriptive detail that teachers are given a
clear programme of what is expected of them. Teachers can
only be successful when the Curriculum clearly communicates
what teachers are required to do. Control in the sense of
constraint is a vital element in that communication.
The characteristics of curriculum control are described in
terms of the Bernstein concepts of coding and framing. By
tracing coding and framing techniques in the Social Science
Curriculum in general and each of the three issues in
particular, this study shows that the antecedents (as
defined by Stake) are strongly controlled (through a
Bernstein-type collection code). On the other hand, some
curriculum control is lost in the transactions (as defined
by Stake) because teaching and learning methods are not
sufficiently framed. Future refinements in this
Curriculum should concentrate on strengthening curriculum
control through increasing the level of specification
and prescription about learning methods.</field><field name="date">1980</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Indonesia</field><field name="subject">Curriculum 75</field><field name="subject">Indonesian schools</field><field name="subject">social science curriculum</field><field name="subject">Stake model</field><field name="subject">curriculum evaluation</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060628.142801</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of the information needs and information-seeking behaviour of Australian accredited coaches in the sports of swimming and track and field</field><field name="creator">Clarke, Nerida</field><field name="description">The purpose of the present study was to examine the information needs and
information seeking behaviour of coaches in the sports of swimming and track and
field who had completed level 2 accreditation of the Australian Coaching Council.
The study aimed to identify information needs, the sources from which
information is currently obtained and to gauge the level of satisfaction with current
information provision in terms of the quantity, content and timeliness of
information received. The study also aimed to examine the influence of the
independent variables of sport, geographic location and education level on
information needs and information seeking behaviour.
In line with current theoretical thinking in the examination of information needs
described in the literature, the researcher took a 'user-centred' approach in the
identification of information needs utilising the structured group discussion
process, Nominal Group Technique (NGT) as the first stage of the research. This
process established the broad parameters of coaches' information needs and
provided the basis for the design of a subsequent survey which was distributed to
all swimming and track and field coaches who had completed level 2 accrediation.
The survey resulted in a response rate of 69 percent from a total population of
568.
The study revealed that coaches have a wide range of information needs many of
which would not generally be associated with libraries, that there are few
differences between coaches from different sports, those of differing education
levels and between those of different geographic locations, although access to
information is made more difficult through geographic isolation. The study
revealed that coaches use multiple sources to obtain information and that libraries
and formal sport information providers are not key sources for most types of
information. Low levels of satisfaction were found to exist with the quantity and
content of information with the highest level of dissatisfaction being expressed
with the timeliness of information received.
The study concludes by identifying issues, recommending possible actions in
relation to these issues and identifies areas for future research.</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">information needs</field><field name="subject">information seeking behaviour</field><field name="subject">coaches</field><field name="subject">information provision</field><field name="subject">Nominal Group Technique</field><field name="subject">NGT</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060628.150854</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The poetry of response : adolescent experiences of two class novels</field><field name="creator">Clarke, Penny L.</field><field name="description">This study, conducted in a junior high school in Canberra, used
naturalistic research methodology and idiographic data analysis. As the
results obtained in the study were time and context specific, the object
was to reveal the personal factors which affected the nature of the
reading experience for individual research participants. The theoretical
basis of the research was derived from Louise Rosenblatt's transactional
theory and focused on the reading experiences of adolescents with whole
class novels.
Three research techniques were employed in the exploration of aesthetic
reader responses to two whole class novels. The techniques: reading
journals, small group discussions and creative written responses to the
text were implemented sequentially and revealed different levels and
stages of individual and group responses from the 'primary spontaneous'
to a considered reflective response. Data was explored through the case
study mode of analysis which included information relevant to the
individual research participants and the study context.
The research explored the integration of the individual's evocation of the
text with the individual's awareness of self, text, literature and the wider
social context. The research data concluded that the employment of
classroom practices which focus on a full, individual transaction with a
text promotes the development of critical awareness of and familiarity
with the text. This sound understanding of the individual's evocation of
the text forms a self-aware and firm basis for the development of active,
engaged and critical readers of texts.</field><field name="date">1993</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">transactional theory</field><field name="subject">Louise Rosenblatt</field><field name="subject">reading experiences</field><field name="subject">class novels</field><field name="subject">adolescents</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060628.155204</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A physiological comparison between standing cycling and running during an intermediate term anaerobic capacity session</field><field name="creator">Clews, Clayton</field><field name="description">This study wished to compare the same physiological responses of elite athletes to a typical
intermediate term anaerobic capacity track running session with those of standing cycling of
similar intensity and duration. Twelve well trained/elite male distance runners completed
maximal running, standing cycling and strength testing sessions; and Intermediate Term
Anaerobic Capacity Sessions (ITACS) in running and standing cycling; each comprising eight
efforts of approximately 30 seconds duration at 90% maximal effort in each mode of activity,
separated by 2 minutes rest.
The experimental sessions took place from the end of November 1996 to the beginning of
March 1997. The subjects were required to attend three maximal experimental sessions,
which were performed on separate days and used for baseline data collection. On completing
these they participated in both running and standing cycling ITACS, performed on separate
days with at least 48 hours between each test protocol. There was complete randomisation of
all test protocols.
Descriptive statistics were determined for all the variables. Independent t-testing was used to
determine if similar temperature and humidity readings were obtained during the maximal
testing for each mode of activity. Paired t-testing was used to compare the differences in
warmup heart rates between the maximal and ITACS, the differences in peak lactates
obtained after each type of ITACS, draw comparisons between heart rate (HR) changes over
time during the ITACS and determine if a difference existed between workloads for the two
modes of activity. It was also used to draw a comparison between the peak BLa values and
ascertain if pre-test creatine kinase (CK) levels were the same for each mode of activity. A
repeated measures one way ANOVA was used to determine if workload reduced over time for
each type of ITACS. A three way ANOVA with repeated measures on one factor (repetition)
was performed on HR response. It was used to determine if there was a difference between
the workload/recovery HR response; if workload/recovery HR values increased over the
duration of each ITACS; and if the workload/recovery HR response over time was mode
specific. A two way ANOVA with repeated measures on one factor (repetition) was
performed on blood lactate (BLa) response. It was used to determine if there was a significant
interaction between the mode of activity and time, if BLa increased over the duration of each
ITACS and if there was an effect of mode on its own on the BLa response. A two way
repeated measures ANOVA was used to ascertain whether there was a difference in CK levels
between the two modes of activity, with Tukey's multiple comparison tests used in post hoc
analyses to show the amount of difference. A linear regression analysis was performed to
determine if BLa response was similar across the duration of each type of ITACS.
The effects of temperature (22.3 &#177; 1.2 vs 21.1 &#177; 0.3 &#176;C, run vs cycle, t = -0.94, n = 12, p =
0.36)) and humidity (57 &#177;4.2 vs 52 &#177; 1.7%, run versus cycle, t = -1.04, n = 12, p = 0.31) did
not influence any of the results obtained during the ITACS. Nor did differing warmup
intensities (as indicated by heart rate - HR) during the maximal (160 &#177; 5.7 vs 158 &#177; 3.1 beats
per minute (bpm), run vs cycle, t = - 0.45, n = 9, p = 0.66) and ITACS (160 &#177; 3.6 vs 152 &#177; 3.1
bpm, run vs cycle, t = -2.81, n = 9, p = 0.02). An equal test preparation was confirmed by the
warmup blood lactate (BLa) levels, which were not significantly different between the
exercise modes for both the maximal (11.0 &#177;0.6 vs 11.8 &#177; 1.0 mmol-l1, run vs cycle, t = 2.26,
ii
n = 10, p =0.23) and ITACS (4.2 &#177; 0.7 vs 4.2 &#177; 0.6 mmol-1 ', run vs cycle, t = 0.27, n = 10, p
= 0.796).
A significantly higher workload was achieved during the running ITACS as compared to the
standing cycling ITACS (105 &#177; 1.1 vs 89 &#177;2.9 %, run vs cycle, t = 10.45, n = 12, p&lt;0.0005).
The increase in workload/recovery HR response and their changes as each type of ITACS
progressed was not mode specific [F(l,40) = 0.94, p &gt; 0.05]. Those subjects who possessed
high BLa concentrations performed less work on the cycle ergometer. There was a strong
negative relationship for average workloads and BLa accumulation for the standing cycling
exercise (Spearmans rho = -0.799, n = 11, p&lt;0.005) suggesting that BLa accumulation was a
limiting factor in work production. The increase in BLa levels was not mode specific F(l,20)
= 1.36, p &gt; 0.05]. The BLa response was comparatively similar because the rate of increase in
BLa accumulation and peak BLa values (19.7 vs 16.9 mmol-l'1, cycle vs run, t = 2.1, n = 11, p
= 0.06) were not significantly different between the modes of activity. Mode in conjunction
with time affected standing cycling BLa response to a greater extent than running BLa levels
[F(4.80) =3.929, p &lt;. 0.05]. Standing cycling BLa concentrations were significantly
negatively correlated with knee extension peak torque (Spearmans rho = - 0.771, n = 11, p &lt;
0.01) and total work (Spearmans rho = - 0.802, n = 11, p &lt; 0.01) measurements. In running
they were negatively correlated with knee flexion total work measurements (Spearman rho = -
0.685, n = 11, p &lt; 0.05) These findings suggest that BLa accumulation occurs from different
muscle fibre recruitment patterns. Less work was performed in isokinetic knee extension
following standing cycling as compared to running (2234 &#177; 68.4 vs 2462 &#177; 78.9 Nm, t = 2.23,
n = 11, p &lt; 0.05) suggesting that standing cycling is more fatiguing on the quadriceps than
running. There was no difference in the knee flexion testing (1799 &#177; 89.6 vs 1785 &#177; 69.2,
cycle vs run, t = 2.23, n = 11, p = 0.96). There was a significant difference in mean creatine
kinase (CK) activity between the two modes 24 hours after completing the ITACS (450 &#177;
73.2 vs 320 &#177; 46.5 I/U, running vs cycle, F = 6.44, df = 1,17, p &lt; 0.01). There was a
significantly greater increase in CK activity and therefore muscle damage, following the
running (mean increase of 190 I/U) as compared to the standing cycling session (mean
increase of 44.0 I/U).
In terms of reducing the risk of injury, achieving a similar cardiovascular response and
achieving comparable BLa accumulation (even though mechanism/s of accumulation may be
different) standing cycling appears to be is a satisfactory substitute for running during an
ITACS. The results of this research strengthen the concept of utilising a simulated mode of
activity as a substitute for the primary activity in order to maximise transfer effects,
providing there is a careful balance between the specific training and the near specific
training. The differing physiological responses between the exercise modes (ie- different
muscle fibre recruitment patterns, different workload capacity, different CK measures)
suggest that standing cycling cannot act as a total/comprehensive replacement for running. A
training study is warranted to further investigate the findings of this research.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">intermediate term anaerobic capacity</field><field name="subject">track running</field><field name="subject">standing cycling</field><field name="subject">elite athletes</field><field name="subject">training</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060628.160711</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Identifying the health needs of
refugees from the former
Yugoslavia living in the Australian
Capital Territory</field><field name="creator">Coe, Christine</field><field name="description">Most health professionals are aware of the amazing diversity of the Australian
population, which is made up of people from over 140 different countries. Of these,
an increasing number have arrived as refugees under Australia's humanitarian
resettlement program.
Research indicates that at least 30% of the 12,000 or so people arriving in Australia
under the humanitarian assistance programmes each year have been exposed to
physical and emotional torture and trauma. They also have well documented health
deficits relating to the health standards in their countries of origin, the level of
deprivation experienced prior to arrival in Australia, and the time they have spent in
transit before arriving in Australia.
The purpose of this study was to review the health status of refugees from the
former Yugoslavia, and to identify the perceived needs of this group, which
represents one of Canberra's largest communities of recently arrived refugees.
Utilising both qualitative and quantitative methodologies, findings showed that the
cohort had significantly lower levels of both physical and mental health than the
wider ACT and Australian population. The difficulties of socialisation of the refugees
into the Australian lifestyle are highlighted. In particular, findings from the study
have demonstrated the lack of appropriate information given to some refugees on
arrival, and the struggles experienced by most of the group with learning a new
language, and coping with unemployment and inadequate housing. The problem of
covert political harassment in Canberra was also described during the interview
process.
Recommendations for improving the situation for these refugees were that
information for refugees prior to, and following arrival in Australia needs to be
consistent and readily available, and there needs to be provision of a formalised
support system from the time of arrival, including a review of language facilities. The
study also recommended that culturally sensitive health promotion and treatment
programs should be incorporated into current health service provision. Nurses are
identified as the appropriate health providers to take a leading role in developing
such programs for refugees, although findings from this study indicate that current
nurse education programs need to place more emphasis on a transcultural
framework for the provision of care.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">refugees</field><field name="subject">health status</field><field name="subject">Yugoslavia</field><field name="subject">nurses</field><field name="subject">health service provision</field><field name="subject">Australian Capital Territory</field><field name="subject">ACT</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060629.093233</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A cross-denominational study of beliefs and attitudes about domestic violence</field><field name="creator">Cogan, Nancy</field><field name="description">This thesis reports the results of a survey of Christian church attenders
which explored their attitudes and beliefs towards domestic violence. An
extensive review of the relevant literature covers the nature of, and research
into domestic violence; attitudes toward domestic violence; the relationship of
domestic violence to doctrines and practices in the Judeo-Chrlstian tradition
and in modern Christianity; and relevant topics in attribution theory. A survey
of beliefs and attitudes about husband-to-wife physical violence was designed
for this project. The questionnaire consisted of 53 items using a 5 point Likert
scale and an optional, open-ended comments section. It was distributed to 12
congregations, representing 6 denominations, in the Canberra region.
Participation was voluntary, and 340 questionnaires were completed. The
gender ratio of the respondents is consistent with other studies of church
attending populations, and Chi-square analysis found no significant
differences in gender balance among the denominations. Factor analysis of the
responses identified 8 subscales which explored themes of responsibility for
and justification of violence, community support for perpetrators and victims,
and beliefs about sex roles. Analysis of variance revealed significant
differences among the denominations in beliefs about sex roles, but failed to
find expected parallels in the justification and responsibility subscales. This
sample is more in agreement than is the general population that neither a
wife's action nor her verbal behaviour is justification for a husband to use
physical force against her, and it is personally more willing to give support to
victims of domestic violence and to helping perpetrators to change. Gender is
more frequently a significant factor across the subscales than denomination.

with emphasis on the systems devised for determining land use,
development control and public participation. Part One covers
the periods during which various authorities and Departments
have been responsible for planning and development. The
long term effect of autocratic attitudes of the early planners
and the subordinate position of the employee/tenant/lessee
on the ordinary rights of the community to participate in
planning is considered. The single minded objective of creating
a monumental city, the determination to preserve at all costs
what each generation of planners regarded as the original plan,
the overriding concern with physical planning and construction,
and the determination of the bureacracy not to share power or
responsibility is noted.
Part Two examines those places in Australia and elsewhere which
have developed democratically and have devised systems to make
planning responsible to the community. A number of common
characteristics are noted. The limitations on the extent of
public participation is acknowledged.
Part Three examines a statutory planning system for the ACT. The
conclusion is reached that the existing system, relying as it
does on antique NSW laws adapted fifty years ago when the town
was in its infancy are totally inadequate for a medium size
city. The existing legislation is particularly defective in
providing for the town planning process and development control
needs of the Territory. The deficiencies of the latest planning
review are noted, and although the retention of the existing
planning authority is supported, its compulsory democratisation
through a Planning Act providing statutory requirments for plan
making and public participation, is advocated.</field><field name="date">1984</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">urban planning</field><field name="subject">Canberra</field><field name="subject">Australian Capital Territory</field><field name="subject">ACT</field><field name="subject">planning systems</field><field name="subject">public participation</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060629.104950</field></doc><doc><field name="title">This is not a thesis</field><field name="creator">Coll, Allyson</field><field name="description">I should like to have completed this process by having this project bound so that it
read from right to left instead of the traditional manner in which we have learnt and
been taught to read. In partaking of such an activity, it would have been my purpose
and intention to share with you my sense of physical discomfort that has situated itself
beside me at various stages from the on-set of my research. Because I believe in this
process, I have decided to follow a traditional approach, and as you can see it reads as
it should from left to right.
In the introductory phase of this study, I assert quite unequivocally that this is not a
thesis. Instead I promote this as a prolegomena; an interlocutory prolusion. But don't
be deceived! This is very much a thesis. It has been researched according to
guidelines, formatted according to specifications and ethically undertaken. I want you
to believe that it is a thesis. Partially because I have pursued this research in a very
serious manner and also because no matter how much we try to avoid becoming
enmeshed in a system, ultimately we find that we are.
Three years ago I embarked on a quest. At this time, I proposed that I would
undertake a study on the Historical Understandings of passion throughout the Western
World. This idea came to a sudden and dramatic halt, through the encountering of
what I should like to refer to as a series of problems. In order to do justice to my
subject, I decided to write about these obstacles, a decision that I hoped would lead me
back to my original statement of intent, following their reconciliation.
It is Michel Foucault, that I credit with the title for this thesis. After reading his book
entitled "This Is Not A Pipe" (1982) I felt a certain sense of inspiration and ethical
obligation that I considered worth taking the risk for. Due to no longer writing a thesis
on passion, I decided that this could not be called a thesis. It could only be an
introduction to my thesis that would speak about why it had become impossible for me
to pursue my thesis at this stage. The other reason that this carries the title of this is
not a thesis, surrounds my favouring the post-modern over any other position that I
have inquired about.
This prolusion involves a discussion surrounding many of the problematics associated
with my research processes. These include extensively looking at existing
methodologies available when undertaking research today. Adjunct to the
illumination of these problems, I look at literary disruptions; my penchant for
knowledge and my naive aspirations which all contributed to thwarting my journey
into completing an adequate study on passion.
Included in this prolegomena, are two diagrammatic representations of passion. The
first seeks to re-inscribe through re-presenting passion away from its traditional
juxtaposition with love or sexual gratification. It re-presents passion as a polyvalent
movement that is vastly more complicated than that to which we have come to believe
in through out the centuries. Accompanying this depiction, are the traditional notions
of passion. This is based on the works of authors such as Aquinas, Daly, Cicero and
McLellan.
In the conclusion of this prolusion, I suggest that there is a need to re-write a new
methodology. One that transcends our current juncture that promotes stances
belonging to foundationalism, anti-foundationalism and non-foundationalism. It is my
ardent belief, that this is a necessary course of action and will enable the subject of
passion to be spoken to as never before.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">passion</field><field name="subject">post-modernism</field><field name="subject">literary disruptions</field><field name="subject">prolegomena</field><field name="subject">Michel Foucault</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060629.110043</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Automatic speaker recognition by linear prediction : a study of the parametric sensitivity of the model</field><field name="creator">Collins, Anthony McLaren</field><field name="description">The application of the linear prediction Model for
speech waveform analysis to context-independent automatic
speaker recognition is explored, primarily in terns of the
parametric sensitivity of the model. Feature vectors to
characterize speakers are formed from linear prediction
speech parameters computed as inverse filter coefficients,
reflection coefficients or cepstral coefficients, and also
power spectrum parameters via Fast Fourier Transform coefficients.
The comparative performance of these parameters is
investigated in speaker recognition experiments. The stability
of the linear prediction parameters is tested over a
range of model order from p=6 to p=30. Two independent
speech databases are used to substantiate the experimental
results.
The quality of the automatic recognition technique is
assessed in a novel experiment based on a direct performance
comparison with the human skill of aural recognition.
Correlation is sought between the performance of the aural
and automatic recognition methods, for each of the four parameter
sets. Although the recognition accuracy of the automatic system is superior to that of the direct aural technique,
the error distributions are highly variable. The performance
of the automatic system is shown to be empirically
based and unlike the intuitive human process.
An extended preamble to the description of the experiments
reviews the current art of automatic speaker recognition,
with a critical consideration of the performance of
linear prediction techniques. As supported by our experimental
results, it is concluded that success in the laboratory
rests upon a rather fragile foundation. Application to
problems beyond the controlled laboratory environment is
seen, therefore, to be still more precarious.</field><field name="date">1982</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">automatic speaker recognition</field><field name="subject">linear prediction</field><field name="subject">speech waveform analysis</field><field name="subject">parametric sensitivity</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060629.120811</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of music and/or muscle relaxation and specific participant variables and their relationship with state anxiety reduction</field><field name="creator">Connor, Pamela K.</field><field name="description">A study was conducted to determine the relationship between three different
methods of relaxation (listening to music, progressive muscle relaxation
(PMR), and a combination of music listening and PMR) and state anxiety
reduction (as indicated by a feeling of reduced tension for the participant,
measured on a self-rating scale). The study also examined the relationship
between specific variables (age, sex, music training, music preferences,
familiarity with music, degree of liking for music, knowledge of, and
experience in, PMR, and learning style) and response to a relaxation method.
The study involved forty male and female volunteers, ranging in age from 18 -
60 years. Participants were randomly assigned to one of three experimental
groups or a control group. Both quantitative and qualitative methods were
used in the analysis of results. Results indicated that for the participants in
this study, all methods were associated with a decrease in state anxiety, the
combined methods being no more effective in achieving reduced tension
levels than the independent methods. However, a significant difference was
achieved between the PMR group and the control group, with the mean
decrease in tension level for the PMR group higher on average than that of
the control group. There was also no significant difference observed
between the relaxation sessions and the controlled opportunity for social
interaction, attended by all participants. Further, case studies indicated that

How can the study of literature make its maximum
contribution within the total field of EFL education?
These are the two major questions which this paper
attempts to answer.
The urge that prompted this study comes from the author's
deep concern with the study of English at advanced
levels in foreign language institutes in China. Research
and study of the students and other circumstances at
these language institutes show that it is possible as
well as desirable for advanced students there to take
up the study of literature.
Literature study was the only approach to language
teaching before the 1940's. In the modern approaches
to language teaching, attention has been given to the
study of language itself, and the study of literature
has been quietly pushed into the shade. It is the
author's belief that, as H.L.B. Moody puts it: 'the
pendulum has perhaps swung too far from one extreme to the
other'
After much research and study about the value of
literature in language classrooms, the author intends
to show in this paper that the study of literature in
language classrooms can be expected to:
a) improve students' general linguistic ability;
b) provide an insight into the culture associated
with the target language;
c) through reading, develop students' comprehension
and ability to read between the lines .
Parallel with these points, this paper is also intended
to establish a theoretical basis for three aspects of the
study of literature in EFL:
Literature as language; (see: Chapter Three)
Literature as experience; (see: Chapter Four)
Literature as art. (see: Chapter Five).
In Chapter Six of this paper, tentative suggestions are
given concerning the problems of selecting appropriate
materials for advanced foreign Language learners, and
how literature study can be carried out both in and
outside classrooms. The limitations of the study of
literature in certain circumstances arc also considered
in Chapter Six.
It is hoped that this paper will serve as a basis for
further study and research.</field><field name="date">1983</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">literature</field><field name="subject">English as a foreign language</field><field name="subject">EFL</field><field name="subject">China</field><field name="subject">foreign language institutes</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060629.131107</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Literature study in EFL education</field><field name="creator">Chi, Pei</field><field name="description">The value of teaching foreign literature in EFL classes in
China and the methods of teaching foreign literature in EFL
classes in China are two questions that this paper attempts
to discuss.
The paper covers three major areas:
1) A brief introduction to the teaching of literature in
EFL classes in China before and now.
2) Theoretical interpretations of the important role of
teaching foreign literature in EFL classes in China
3) Practical application of literature teaching in EFL
classes in China.
In the first area, the author gives some information about
literature teaching before 1950 and now and also mentions
the advantages of teaching literature in China now.
The second area shows what literature is and why Chinese EFL
students should study foreign literature. The author
intends to show in this area that the main purpose of
teaching foreign literature in EFL classes in China should
not be to increase students' ability to appreciate novels,
but to:
1) get information and knowledge of culture, history in
the target language countries
2) increase students' ability to appreciate the thought
pattern of the people in the target language countries
3) improve students' four language skills.
Finally, some suggestions on what to teach, how to teach and
how to evaluate the teaching result are provided. In order
to apply the theories that this paper has mentioned to
practical teaching, the author presents two teaching plans
at the end.</field><field name="date">1984</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">EFL</field><field name="subject">english as a foreign language</field><field name="subject">foreign literature</field><field name="subject">China</field><field name="subject">language skills</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060627.163457</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Space subdivision and distributed databases in a multiprocessor raytracer</field><field name="creator">Cooper, C.</field><field name="description">This thesis deals with computer generated images.
The thesis begins with an overview of a generalised
computer graphics system, including a brief survey of typical
methods for generating photorealistic images. One such
technique, ray tracing, is used as the basis for the work
which follows. The overview section concludes with a
statement of the aim which is to:
Investigate the effective use of available processing
power and effective utilisation of available memory by
implementing a ray tracing programme which uses space
subdivision, multiple processors and a distributed
world model database.
The problem formulation section describes the ray
tracing principle and then introduces the main areas of study.
The INMOS Transputer (a building block for concurrent
systems) is used to implement the multiple process ray tracer.
Space subdivision is achieved by repeated and regular
subdivision of a world cube (which contains the scene to be
ray traced) into named cubes, called octrees. The subdivision
algorithm continues to subdivide space until no octree
contains more than a specified number of objects, or until the
practical limit of space subdivision is reached.
The objects in the world model database are distributed
in a round robin manner to the ray trace processes. During
execution of the ray trace programme, information about each
object is passed between processes by a message mechanism.
The concurrent code for the transputer processes, written
in OCCAM 2, was developed using timing diagrams and signal
flow diagrams derived by analogy from digital electronics.
Structure diagrams, modified to be consistent with OCCAM 2
processes, were derived from the timing diagrams and signal
flow diagrams. These were used as a basis for the coding.
The results show that space subdivision is an effective
use of processor power because the number of trial
intersections of rays with objects is dramatically reduced.
In addition, distribution of the world model database avoids
duplication of the database in the memory of each process and
hence better utilisation of available memory is achieved.
The programmes are supported by a menu driven interface
(running on a PC AT) which enables the user to control the
ray trace processes running on the transputer board housed in
the PC.</field><field name="date">1991</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">computer generated images</field><field name="subject">computer graphics</field><field name="subject">raytracer</field><field name="subject">ray tracing</field><field name="subject">INMOS Transputer</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060629.145540</field></doc><doc><field name="title">What do parents and teachers want of their primary schools? : The community expectations of primary schools program : an attempt to find out</field><field name="creator">Cooper, Patricia M.</field><field name="description">This field study report represents an examination of some survey and
workshop techniques used to extend the development of community interest
in three nominated schools, to elicit their perceptions of the educational
responsibilities of the School and to extend the implementation of
those perceptions to the operational classroom level. The report includes
a critique of the techniques of the survey and workshop program; comment
on the nature and quality of survey and workshop results; an interpretation
of results and their implications and some recommendations based
on the findings.
The survey and workshop program achieved the provision of a widely based
body of knowledge regarding parents' and teachers' aims priorities. It
provided the means to measure agreement, and disagreement between teachers
and parents, parents and parents, teachers and teachers. It made possible
the identification of specific areas of disagreement and their extent.
The program identified some shared concerns of parents and teachers; it
also recognised shared perceptions of the school's achievement and provided
a rare opportunity for teachers and parents to work co-operatively
to a better understanding of the complementary roles of home and school.
The data which emerged from the study suggests considerable agreement
between parents and teachers about the direction and extent of the responsibilities
of the school for development of the whole child.
Further, substantial confidence in the school enterprise is expressed
by parents and teachers who took part in the survey. This attitude was confirmed at small-group workshop meetings where parents and
teachers worked co-operatively and constructively toward an understanding
of the complementary roles of school and home in achieving agreed
aims.
The program concluded leaving a feeling that it had helped to establish
a foundation of information and expertise on which schools could continue
to develop a cyclical and organic approach to aims formulation. The
provision of information and experience with strategies for teachers and
parents to work with will encourage and facilitate the interpretation of
aims into operational classroom terms at various levels appropriate to
the education of primary school children.</field><field name="date">1978</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">primary schools</field><field name="subject">teachers</field><field name="subject">parents</field><field name="subject">survaey</field><field name="subject">attitudes</field><field name="subject">community expectations</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060629.150821</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The excellent principal - what do students think? : Perceptions of selected senior primary school students about the role of the principal in three New South Wales public primary schools</field><field name="creator">Corish, Sylvia</field><field name="description">The research outlined in this thesis explores the issue of the
effective principal through the perceptions of a sample of senior
primary aged school students. The study originated due to a concern
that too much of the current literature concerning effective schools
and effective principals relies on the views of significant adults.
Given that students are the focus of the school's and principal's
energy it is difficult to understand why their views have not been
sought more frequently. This study was initiated and conducted in an
effort to determine what is was that students expected of the
effective principal.
The research is based on content analysis of the written responses
from a sample of one hundred and ninety five senior primary aged
school students aged between ten and twelve years from an
education district in an education region of the New South Wales
Public School System and in addition one to one interviews with a
group of thirty students. The analysis resulted in the development of
two sets of descriptors. One set of descriptors outline the fourteen
most significant Behaviour Descriptors of the effective principal as
perceived by the senior primary aged students surveyed while the
other set outlines the eleven most significant Quality Descriptors of
the effective principal.
These two sets of descriptors of the effective principal have much
support in the effective schools research. One area notably different
however is the emphasis given by the students to the need for the
principal to develop positive, warm and caring relationships with
each student in the school. Although students were realistic in their
understanding of what this implied they were adamant and
consistent in their desire for such a relationship in order that the
principal be deemed effective.
The results of the study provide specific, clear, unambiguous
descriptions of behaviours and qualities expected of the effective
principal by the students surveyed. The descriptors are presented in
a manner useful to practitioners.</field><field name="date">1991</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">principals</field><field name="subject">primary school students</field><field name="subject">New South Wales</field><field name="subject">NSW</field><field name="subject">public schools</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060629.160710</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Unwritten histories : a short story collection</field><field name="creator">Cormick, Craig</field><field name="description">n/a</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">short stories</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060629.161724</field></doc><doc><field name="title">NESB students at secondary college and university : a comparison of NESB success rates and an investigation into some of the factors which may affect study outcomes</field><field name="creator">Cornish, Audrey</field><field name="description">The increasing number of non-English speaking background (NESB) students
(from both Australia and overseas) has led to concerns about the appropriateness
of English as a Second Language (ESL) courses at upper secondary level as a
preparation for tertiary study. These concerns have been voiced at both upper
secondary and tertiary levels. It appears that NESB students' English language
levels at Year 12 are a critical factor in determining whether or not they will
succeed at tertiary study. On the other hand, they at times achieve high levels of
competence in mainstream subject areas which are not reflected in their ESL
results. Several other factors may also affect NESB students' tertiary success
rates e.g. language and cultural background, and length of time in Australia. In
addition, the responses of tertiary institutions to such students and their needs
may be of importance.
This study surveys the backgrounds and success rates of NESB students from
an ACT secondary college who moved into tertiary study programs. It
investigates their results in their Year 12 Certificates and traces them through
three years of tertiary study. In doing so, the study identifies certain factors
which appear to impact upon the students' success rates.
Results obtained may prove beneficial to ESL service providers at upper
secondary level. Furthermore, tertiary institutions may find such an analysis
helpful in assisting them to develop appropriate approaches to meet the needs of
this particular group of students.</field><field name="date">1992</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">NESB</field><field name="subject">non-English speaking background</field><field name="subject">ESL</field><field name="subject">English as a second language courses</field><field name="subject">secondary schools</field><field name="subject">tertiary education</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060629.163744</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Nightlife : a study of the quality of working life of the night nurse, with implications for selection and education</field><field name="creator">Coughlin-West, V.</field><field name="description">Research into the quality of life of nurses
working at night has received scant attention to
date. Apart from studies relating to changes in
circadian rhythms of night nurses, very few other
aspects of the complex adaptive process have been
given serious consideration. Yet, knowledge of
that adaptive process is a prerequisite for the
selection of staff, and for the design of an
appropriate educational programme and staff
development strategy.
This study looks first at methods of describing
the quality of life in general, in order to aim at
criteria for evaluation which do not impose the
conventional position that day work is proper work.
In the light of these criteria, preconceptions and
limitations which surround shift work in general
are identified and discussed. Night nurses as a
group are then subjected to a more intensive examination,
including a theoretical review; a survey
of a population of one-hundred and sixty-one night
nurses and selected interviews; and an account of
a pilot study of a potential curriculum.
Results of the survey indicate that nurses who
show a preference for night work and who selfselect
these hours on a permanent basis are more
likely to derive challenge from and express greater
satisfaction with their work, than those on alternative
day and night shifts. Further, there is a
stable population of workers who choose night work
above all other options as a source of personal
satisfaction, freedom and challenge. In the light
of these findings, recommendations are made as to
the selection, education and development of
hospital night staff.</field><field name="date">1983</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">night nurses</field><field name="subject">quality of life</field><field name="subject">shift work</field><field name="subject">night staff</field><field name="subject">staff selection</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060629.164652</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Residential police education and its implications for curriculum design</field><field name="creator">Couper, Brian J.</field><field name="description">The current policy in New South Wales of referring to
its law enforcement body as Police without reference to the word
"force", is testimony to the re-emergence of the concept of community
policing.
This study deals with this phenomenon and the concept
of discretion, which allows police to take action according to
the dictates of a given situation rather than always act within
the strict letter of the law. While the power of discretion
should be used lawfully and ethically, political, legal and social
acceptance of such an approach allows a more flexible strategy
for coping with issues associated with deviant behaviour and
social injustice.
Therefore, the study present a holistic approach to
a curriculum for police recruits. It deals with the linking
of "reactive" and "proactive" policing strategies by means of
discretion and in so doing enhances the police officer's ability
to make a reasoned judgement in choosing between a number of
alternatives according to the dictates of the situation.
The proposed curriculum takes account of new policing
strategies, students' needs and career aspirations, modem
technology, effective teaching methods and the need for recruit
training to be attuned to dynamic changes in social needs and
demands.
The study also emphasises the need for further research
into the role of field training officers and the integration
of field training with academy education as a vital component
in the preparation of a police officer for the complex role ahead.</field><field name="date">1987</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">New South Wales</field><field name="subject">police</field><field name="subject">community policing</field><field name="subject">police discretion</field><field name="subject">curriculum</field><field name="subject">field training</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060629.170144</field></doc><doc><field name="title">'Walking back along the thought' : a heuristic</field><field name="creator">Cousens, Elizabeth Veronica Eve</field><field name="description">This study deals with the writing of senior students in the subject
English from two ACT secondary colleges. Whilst the written work
analysed is from students enrolled in courses accredited for
tertiary entrance, the ACT'S high retention rate and students'
tendency to avoid 'non-tertiary' courses, ensures that the scripts
analysed are wide-ranging.
Broadly, this study rests on the theoretical approach to language
and learning that came out of Dartmouth: that which is associated
with James Britton. Its focus is twofold. In Volume I it presents
a heuristic, describing its development and discussing the thinking,
and learning students appear to do - and the writing they do - as a
result of using it.
The heuristic is called 'streaming' by the students who use it and
is based on Vygotsky's notion of 'Inner Speech'. A key phrase that
expresses a powerful or rich idea about the subject being studied is
used as a starting point for student thinking. Students explore the
layers of cognitive and affective meaning encapsulated in the idea,
and perhaps extend the idea, in writing. The writing is very rough,
and an act of thought whereby the meaning of the phrase is
accommodated, rather than a communication to others.
Students are asked NOT to think prior to setting pen to paper, but
to let their writing 'bring their thought out of the shadows' by
giving words to it. This avoids superficial or cliched response
because the process of 'thinking out loud in writing' allows an
interplay of cognitive and affective meaning that seems to lead
students in to abstract thinking, generally by way of poetic
abstraction. The 'streaming' that students do becomes the basis for
further discussion or writing in a variety of forms.
Volume II is given over to an explication, and use, of Graham
Little's development and refinement of an analytical model for
investigating language use. Based on the variables of situation,
function and form, it enables the empirical analysis of 237 examples
of writing from students who had used the heuristic presented in
Volume I.
The analysis indicates that students who use the heuristic write
differently from students who do not. Their writing shows a wide
range of function and form and achieves unusually high levels of
abstraction. The thinking and writing that students do when using
the heuristic is usually realised poetically and used as a basis for
further writing. The range within the student writing indicates a
high degree of language competence whereby students are able to
write in different forms.
Little's analytical model is a simple and powerful means of
quantifying elements of school language in order to make qualitative

A survey was administered to determine what tasks
the students believed important for secondary schools and
how well the students considered Narrabundah College
achieved these tasks. It has been possible to analyse
the relative importance and achievement of the individual
tasks because of the ranking procedure involved.
Part I of the research instrument was extracted
from a survey, commissioned by the Committee of Inquiry
into Education and Training, distributed to New South Wales
students. This was a component of a comprehensive study
of the views of students, teachers and parents conducted
by the Community Expectations Group, School of Teacher
Education, Canberra College of Advanced Education, 1978.
The responses given by the Narrabundah College
students are compared with the N.S.W. students' responses
and are also compared with the conclusions from other
surveys concerning the objectives of secondary education.
These comparisons are discussed with reference to
the unique characteristics of the secondary colleges which
developed from the Report of the Working Committee on

disruption to the mathematical progress of Year 11 students in the Australian Capital
Territory senior secondary colleges. If students are to perform their best in
mathematics they need their transition from high school to college to be as smooth as
possible. Nevertheless, many students change their mathematics enrolment soon after
commencing college.
The study relies particularly upon The Theory of Reasoned Action to determine
whether students have the intention both before and during the transition of performing
well in mathematics at college. Although this measure provides a predictor of the
intention, it does not necessarily follow that the conditions allow the student to comply
with the prediction.
Statistical instruments were also used - to determine whether students initially enrol in
appropriate courses and whether they perform as well in their first semester at college
as in Year 10. A small sample of students was interviewed to elicit whether there was
supporting evidence for some conclusions drawn from the results and the literature
survey.
Analyses of the predictor of intention indicate that during the transition period a very
high proportion of students intends to perform well in mathematics at college. Analysis
of the components of the measure pinpoints some small differences between high
schools.
The statistical analyses show that a significant proportion of students completes
Semester 1 in mathematics courses other than those of initial enrolment and that
performance by the Year 11 students correlates well with Year 10 performance.
Discussion centres around actions of intervention and their focus. Parents and
guardians are possible recipients of further information since the evidence suggests they
are the most influential advisers in the lives of this age group. College teachers are
possibly the best current providers of that information, although, high school teachers
and careers advisers could take a more prominent role following appropriate training.
Recommendations are made concerning the enrolment procedure and the beginning of
Year 11 routine. Other conclusions and recommendations concern action by classroom
teachers that could ensure more students succeed in the course of initial enrolment,
whether they are in the course most suited to their previous performance or are
attempting a more difficult course.</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">secondary colleges</field><field name="subject">Australian Capital Territory</field><field name="subject">ACT</field><field name="subject">mathematics</field><field name="subject">theory of reasoned action</field><field name="subject">transition</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060630.095231</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The administration of community service orders for juvenile offenders in the Australian Capital Territory</field><field name="creator">Coventry, Helen</field><field name="description">n/a</field><field name="date">1985</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">community service orders</field><field name="subject">Australian Capital Territory</field><field name="subject">ACT</field><field name="subject">juvenile offenders</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060630.100112</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Searching by browsing</field><field name="creator">Cox, Kevin Ross</field><field name="description">Information retrieval (IR) is an important part of many tasks performed by people when they
use computers. However, most IR research and theory isolates the IR component from the
tasks performed by users. This is done by expressing user needs as a query performed on a
database. In contrast this dissertation investigates the design and evaluation of information
retrieval systems where the information retrieval mechanisms remain embedded in the user
tasks.
While there are a many different types of user tasks performed with computers we can specify
common requirements for the IR needed in most tasks. There are both user interface and
machine processing requirements. For user interfaces it is desirable if users interact directly
with information databases, keep control of the interaction and are able to perform IR in a
timely manner. Machine processing has to be within the capabilities of machines yet must fit
with human perceptions and has to be efficient in both storage and computation.
Given the overall requirements, the dissertation gives a particular implementation for how to
embed IR in tasks. The implementation uses a vector representation for objects and organises
the objects in a near neighbour data structure. Near neighbours are defined within the context
of the tasks the users wish to achieve. While the implementation could use many different
finding mechanisms, it emphasises a constructive solution building approach with localised
browsing in the database. It is shown how the IR implementation fits with the overall task
activities of the user.
Much of the dissertation examines how to evaluate embedded IR. Embedded IR requires
testing users' task performance in both real experiments and thought experiments.
Implementation is tested by finding known objects, by validating the machine representations
and their correspondence with human perceptions and by testing the machine performance of
the implementation.
Finally implications and extensions of the work arc explored by looking at the practicality of
the approach, other methods of investigation and the possibility of building dynamic learning
systems that improve with use.</field><field name="date">1994</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">information retrieval</field><field name="subject">browsing</field><field name="subject">user interface</field><field name="subject">machine processing</field><field name="subject">user tasks</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060630.102136</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ethics and the advocate</field><field name="creator">Crispin, K. J.</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the ethical implications of legal professional advocacy in an
adversary system of justice. It identifies a standard conception of the advocate's duty
which is encapsulated in the various professional codes and its fundamental principles of
partisanship and zealous advocacy. It acknowledges that the standard conception
involves a duty to pursue the interests of clients without regard for the interests of others
and explores the inevitable moral ambivalence which such an absolute loyalty entails. The
concept of role morality upon which this conception is based is explored. This involves
an examination of the adversary system of justice and the extent to which it serves the
public interest. It is concluded that the adversary system is of considerable utility in
maintaining individual rights, eliciting the truth, providing an important element of ritual
and sublimating conflict. Consequently, its value provides ethical justification for lawyers
to fulfil the adversarial roles upon which it depends. However, it is contended that it
neither requires nor justifies the absolutism inherent in the standard conception of the
advocate's duty. A number of alternative paradigms are considered but rejected as
inadequate. It is argued that the existing norms of partisanship and zealous advocacy
should be retained but relegated to prima facie duties which may have to be balanced
against competing ethical demands such as the need to avoid causing undue harm to
others.</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">advocacy</field><field name="subject">adversary system</field><field name="subject">ethics</field><field name="subject">law</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060630.172938</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Factors affecting public policy processes : the experience of the industries assistance commission</field><field name="creator">Croker, Keith L.</field><field name="description">Public policies are, at once, the means for articulation of political
philosophies and processes, the conduits for conversion of political
and bureaucratic decisions into actions and the means by which the
electorate can assess government performance. Public policy
processes offer a means of achieving social and economic change and
they are a primary justification for the existence of governmental
systems. On these counts, identification of the elements of policy
processes and the ways they interact with each other is essential to
an understanding of the relationships between public policy decisions,
systems of democratic government and their connections with wider
society.
This thesis goes behind the facade of public policy outcomes and
analyses the processes involved in arriving at policy decisions.
Linkages are traced between political theories, the processes of
public policy decisions and final policy outcomes. This involves,
first, an examination and critique of liberal-democratic theories.
Second, there is detailed examination of pluralist democratic practice,
which is the prevailing political paradigm of modern western
liberal-democratic societies. The analysis finds substantial evidence
of gross distortions in the process relative to normative theories.
Plain causes are the institutionalisation of special interests to the
exclusion of wider public interests and inadequate accountability of
governments and bureaucracies for their actions.
Policy processes in pluralist systems are examined and it is concluded
that the social environment, institutional influences and factors which
affect the behaviour of institutions are key elements explaining public
policy decisions.
The capacity for pluralism to significantly influence policy outcomes
depends largely on the degree and nature of access to the public policy
process at various points.
In examining the role of government institutions in public policy
processes, it is argued that a clear distinction between the elected
legislature and the administrative bureaucracy is artificial and
misleading. Further, there is evidence that public service bureaucrats
can become captives of their particular client groups and, thus, less
accessible to the full range of relevant interests. These problems are
exacerbated by the two-party Westminster model of representative
democracy which tends to concentrate power in cabinet government,
resulting in a decline in the importance of parliament as a deliberative
and scrutinising bodies.
This dissertation develops the view that there are significant causal
links between institutional philosophies and values and the dominant
disciplines within institutions. It is also argued that growing
professionalism in bureaucracies and a tendency for functional divisions
of public policy to be in broad symmetry with the divisions of the
professions, tends to intensify the influence of particular professional
disciplines on related areas of public policy.
The critique of liberal-democratic theories and the related discussion
of factors affecting policy processes in a pluralist system are used to
identify the essential elements of public policy processes. It is
proposed that all policy processes contain the four elements of
pluralism, access, accountability and planning which are interactively
related. Differences in emphasis given to these elements in the policy
process explains the nature of individual policy decisions. Thus, the
normative policy process datum model provides both a static and dynamic
framework for analysing policy decisions.
In order to examine the theoretical arguments in an empirical context,
the policy processes of the Australian Federal Government, in the area
of industry assistance, are analysed. This policy arena contains all
the 'raw material' of pluralist processes and is, therefore, a fertile
area for analysis. Furthermore, operating within this policy arena is
the Industries Assistance Commission [IAC], a bureaucratic institution
which is quite unlike traditional administrative structures. The IAC
has, prima-facie, all of the features of the policy process datum model;
it operates in an open mode, it encourages a range of pluralistic inputs,
it has a highly professional planning function and, because its policy
advice is published, it encourages scrutiny and accountability of
itself, other actors in the bureaucracy and the elected government. The
IAC operates in a rational-comprehensive mode.
The analysis concludes that the IAC was established in part to be a
countervailing force to restore some balance in the industry policy
arena. In this it has been partly successful - the distributive policy
decisions of governments have come under much greater scrutiny than in
the past and other areas of the bureaucracy have been forced to operate
more frequently in a rational-comprehensive mode, rather than as
advocates of sectional interests.
The IAC has itself limited its range of objectives, however, and has
tended to become a computational organisation, isolating its core
economic [planning] technology from the interactive processes of the
policy process model, i.e. pluralism, access and accountability. By
protecting its essential philosophy in this way, the IAC runs the risk
of becoming less influential in the overall policy process.
Using the policy process model as a datum, and the empirical experience
of the IAC and the policy arena in which it operates, several options
for administrative reform are examined. A summary agenda for
administrative change is proposed which revolves around ways of achieving
balanced pluralistic inputs, a greater degree of access, better
bureaucratic and government accountability and ways of exploiting but
controlling technocratic planning expertise. Emphasis is placed on the
need to achieve enriched interactive flows between each of these key
elements. If these conditions can be met, it is proposed that a revised
and improved administrative bureaucracy will emerge.</field><field name="date">1986</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">public policy processes</field><field name="subject">Industries Assistance Commission</field><field name="subject">IAC</field><field name="subject">pluralism</field><field name="subject">access</field><field name="subject">accountability</field><field name="subject">bureaucracy</field><field name="subject">Australian Federal Government</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060630.174015</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Social welfare professionals as managers : a feminist perspective</field><field name="creator">Crosland, Gerri</field><field name="description">The dissertation presents the argument that the formal training of a professional social

Within the general topic of welfare, research is first directed to the Australian welfare

the writer a) critically explores traditional and contemporary theories, with special
reference being made to bureaucracy, organization, and management; b) investigates
theories and practices of social workers and social work managers to ascertain their
relevance to contemporary Australian society, using the A.C.T. Family Services Branch as an
example of a social welfare agency. This assists in explaining the context, functions and

services, and counsellors have been challenged to demonstrate that what
they do makes a difference and that what they do meets the needs of the
system in which they work. Thus proponents of the consultancy model such
as Dinkmeyer (1973) have urged counsellors to move from the crisis-oriented
approach in which only a few benefit from counsellor services to a
consultative role which involves the counsellor with the total system.
In 1979 the author was appointed to the Metropolitan West District of Sydney. This is an area with many social problems such as high
unemployment, single parent families and families receiving social welfare
benefits.
Many students attending school are adversely affected by their home
environment. To compound the problem a difference in value systems exists
between home and school, which is a source of frustration to both teachers
and students. As a result many children were referred for counselling
because they were behaviour problems in the classroom. It was not possible
for the counsellor to see all the students referred so other strategies
needed to be employed.
From discussions with teachers concerning the management of
students who were behaviour problems it became apparent that teacher
training had left them ill-equipped to deal with the student behaviours they
were facing.
A Classroom Management and Interpersonal Skills programme was
designed and presented to a group of Primary school teachers in one of the
schools to which the author was appointed.
Evaluation of the effectiveness of the programme was based on the
statistical analysis of pretest and post-test measures of teachers and
students of those teachers participating in the programme.
In addition to reporting on outcomes of the programme this study
provides a theoretical rationale for its development.
The statistical evidence does not strongly support the effectiveness of
the programme. However there are some trends, particularly in the
teacher data, which suggest that the programme was effective in bringing
about teacher attitude change towards students.
Teachers' written evaluations of the programme, together with
informal feedback, indicate the programme was successful in providing
some of the answers to behaviour problems which occur in the classroom.
A corollary to the presentation of the programme has been a
reduction in the number of children referred to the author as "behaviour
problems".
This has provided more time to work with infant children and parents,
both counsellor functions which the administrative staff see as significant,
and to continue in the role as a consultant to teachers.</field><field name="date">1982</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">classroom management</field><field name="subject">interpersonal skills</field><field name="subject">counsellors</field><field name="subject">teachers</field><field name="subject">Metropolitan West District</field><field name="subject">Sydney</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060703.174146</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Children's comments on stories : a study of the propositions about evaluating and composing stories advanced by eight and eleven year old children</field><field name="creator">Croucher, Vaughan Stewart</field><field name="description">The purpose of this study was to investigate children's
comments on stories. Through a series of interviews the study
sought to elicit comments from six 8 year old and six 11 year
old children on evaluating literature, both their own and
others and on how they compose stories. A classification
system was applied to these comments so as to represent them as
set of propositions, constructs or concerns about evaluating
and composing stories. The system of classification applied
was derived from the children's comments rather than use
pre-determined categories. Propositions for evaluation were
represented as a list of 'traits' and those for composing as a
list of 'facets of the composing process.'
These propositions were then compared and contrasted by age and
mode (evaluation of reading or writing and comments on
composing). This analysis led to the identification of some
common concerns and patterns of response as well as
distinctions according to age and the topic discussed.
Video taped writing episodes were used to investigate the
composing process. The children were asked to comment whilst
writing and this was replayed for them to invite further
comment and explanation. All other interviews were recorded on
audio tape.
Finally consideration is given to further applications of the
analysis and methodology to children's comments.</field><field name="date">1984</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">stories</field><field name="subject">children's literature</field><field name="subject">evaluating stories</field><field name="subject">composing stories</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060704.091236</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The development of an integrated humanities programme at an open space high school in the A.C.T.</field><field name="creator">Cumming, Kenneth Ward</field><field name="description">This field study attempts to analyse the development of an integrated
humanities programme at a recently built open space high school in the
A.C.T. during the first three years of its existence.
The school opened shortly after the beginning of the A.C.T. Educational
System and the staff were imbued with the idealism and innovative climate
that prevailed at this time. There was an absence of system constraint
that co-incided with the political proclamation of school based curriculum
development.
This field study is the story of what can happen when a staff is plunged
into the deep end of innovation without the necessary support systems.
Nevertheless some of the innovations have stabilised, with some promise
of permanency, during these first three years.
Open View began with a radical curriculum from the beginning:
i) a child centred curriculum
ii) vertically integrated teaching groups
iii) non-streaming of students
iv) open access curriculum
v) an individualised teaching programme
vi) little traditional class group teaching
vii) staff participation in decision making
viii) a mini-school structure based on a strong pastoral system
ix) non competitive continuous assessment
x) a large degree of subject integration
All of these innovations can be viewed in the humanities programme.
A controversial programme such as humanities has had a radical effect
upon the rest of the school. Hence in tracing the development of the
humanities programme, the field study indirectly traces the development
of the total school.
The innovation that has particular relevance to educationalists is
the development of the mini-school structure and the combination of
the pastoral and the academic through the teaching teams of the minischools.
The principal theme of this field study is the effect that
the mini-school and subject integration has had on traditional roles
such as that of the subject seniors and the assistant principals.</field><field name="date">1980</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">humanities programme</field><field name="subject">high schools</field><field name="subject">ACT</field><field name="subject">Australian Capital Territory</field><field name="subject">open space high school</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060704.092242</field></doc><doc><field name="title">How young children make aesthetic responses to visual art of their peers</field><field name="creator">Cunningham, Alan David</field><field name="description">This study sought to investigate the way in which young children respond

A total of 296 seven-year-old children were interviewed in small groups of
three or four and asked to respond to visual art materials. These subjects
were drawn from schools in the states of Queensland, New South Wales

Results indicated that two factors associated with the appraisal of art works
seemed to exist: a function of making aesthetic judgements and a function
of gathering and interpreting information about the art works. The study
found that children utilized a three-phase process in making aesthetic
judgements. The first phase seemed to be pre-figured; the second and third
phase seemed to occur as a outcome of prompting. This three-phase process

and the number of English learners increases every year.
Whatever the course of teaching English may be, the teaching
of pronunciation is always a beginning part of it.
The materials used in teaching pronunciation vary from
schools to colleges, but the way of teaching is always
the same. It means that students have to imitate what the
teachers have pronounced with a very simple explanation
of how to pronounce it. This causes great problems, because
not all teachers have correct pronunciation and not all
students can imitate the teachers in the right way.
At the Hanoi Foreign Languages College, students are
trained to be teachers of English. They not only need to
have correct pronunciation, but also need to know how to
pronounce sounds. In order to teach pronunciation effectively,
they need to have a certain knowledge of phonetics
and know the difference and similarity between the sound
systems of English and Vietnamese.
To help awareness of the necessity of good pronunciation
and the present problems associated with teaching it, this report:
a/ points out the importance of teaching English
pronunciation in teaching English;
b/ gives an overview of English teaching in general
and the teaching of pronunciation in particular.
To improve the teaching of pronunciation at the Hanoi
Foreign Languages College, this report:
c/ makes a comparison between sound systems of
English and Vietnamese;
d/ proposes material for the teaching of pronunciation
for the Vietnamese students of the Hanoi
Foreign Languages College, bearing in mind the
context of the Vietnamese teaching and learning
situation.
It is hoped that this report will be of practical use:
for teachers and students in the Hanoi Foreign Languages

Field Study, sees the changing role; of the principal as an evolutionary
process, and traces this process from the early years of
the nineteenth century (when schooling was private and independent)
through the middle years of this same century and onwards (the
growth of public education) up to modern times.
The review studies in depth the literature of the past
fifteen to twenty years, and avers that the literature of this
period indicates that the expected role of the principal, today,
is one of leadership. It discusses the behaviour characteristics
of leadership and suggests that, depending upon the degree to
which these characteristics are present in the leader's behaviour,
various typical leaders may be described.
Finally, the review postulates future trends in the role of
principal and predicts also, the possible eventual demise of this
administrative position.
Part II of the Field Study contains the findings of a survey
of the primary school principals of the Australian Capital
Territory - both government and non-government. This survey,
which involved the completion of a questionnaire consisting of
three sections, was designed to provide information regarding the
role - functions and work-load of the principal, his leadership
characteristics, and his perceptions and predictions regarding
change. From this information significant inferences are drawn
concerning the role-perceptions and role-expectations of the
primary principal in the A.C.T.
Inferences drawn from the data of Section A of the questionnaire
concern time; priorities of various role-functions, preferred
approaches,to role-functions involving human relationships, the
degree of acceptance of the implication of the policies of the
A.C.T. Schools Authority, and attitudes towards professional
development.
The data of Section B provides information from which
inferences regarding the leadership characteristics of the
principals are drawn, and Section C data provides material
lending support for the postulates of both the previous
sections.
The concluding section discusses the implications of these
findings for the present and future roles of the principal in
the A.C.T., and suggests possible areas for further research.</field><field name="date">1977</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">principals</field><field name="subject">leadership</field><field name="subject">Australian Capital Territory</field><field name="subject">ACT</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060704.101931</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The acute physiological responses of elite cross country skiers to exercise at sea level and moderate altitude</field><field name="creator">Daley, Phillipa J.</field><field name="description">Nine Australian male cross country ski team members (19.8&#177;2.5 years,

decades. They have been underpinned by shifts in psychological and pedagogical theory, the
most recent of which fit broadly under the heading of constructivism. During this time, there
have also been significant changes in the development of Computer Assisted Learning (CAL)
resources. These changes have tended to be driven by technological developments, such as
the availability of desktop computers with multimedia capabilities, and more recently the
increasing prominence of the Internet, rather than developments in teaching and learning
theory.
The aim of this research is to analyse the implications of a constructivist view of teaching and
learning for the development of CAL resources. Specifically, the research attempts to describe
the nature of constructivist CAL resources, before proposing a model for the development of
such resources. The capabilities of existing tools for the development of constructivist CAL
resources are also analysed.
In looking at the nature of constructivist CAL resources, developments in pedagogical theory
that have lead to the constructivist position are reviewed, along with constructivist theories of
teaching practice. This body of theory is then synthesised into ten principles of constructivist
teaching and learning.
The implications of a constructivist view of teaching and learning for CAL resources are then
examined. A range of constructivist CAL approaches are identified, and a classification
scheme for constructivist CAL is proposed. This scheme involves the classification of a CAL
approach according to the learner activities it facilitates, the input techniques used and the
processing and output techniques used.
The process of developing CAL resources is then addressed. The selection of CAL
approaches that are likely to assist with the achievement of specific categories of learning
outcome is recognised as being central to this process. Matrices relating categories of learning
outcome to categories of learner activity and categories of learner activity to categories of
input, processing and output technique are proposed. A model for developing CAL resources,
that makes use of these matrices is proposed. In developing this model, instructional design
models and software development models are reviewed.
Finally, support provided by existing authoring tools, for the development of constructivist
CAL resources using the proposed model is examined. Six of the most popular authoring
tools, including tools designed primarily for CD-ROM based resource development and tools
designed primarily for Web-based development are reviewed.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Computer Assisted Learning</field><field name="subject">CAL</field><field name="subject">constructivism</field><field name="subject">authoring tools</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060704.114538</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Towards a syllabus for teaching commercial letter writing to commerce students in Vietnam</field><field name="creator">Dan, Nguyen Trong</field><field name="description">There are increasing needs for trained business persons as a result of the
recent rapid development of foreign trade in Vietnam. A good command of
written commercial English is one of the most important qualifications of a
business person. At present the Hanoi Foreign Trade College is the only
institution which is responsible for training commerce students. The
teaching of writing skill in general and the teaching of commercial letter
writing in particular still leave much to be desired. The writing skill of
graduates of the Hanoi Foreign Trade College is far from satisfactory
This Field Study Report aims at identifying the difficulties and the needs of
commerce students in the Hanoi Foreign Trade College. It takes into
consideration the language and learning needs of the target students in
order to suggest a syllabus for the teaching of commercial letter writing to
commerce students more efficiently.
The Field Study Report consists of seven chapters.
Chapter I provides an analysis of the teaching and learning situations at the
Hanoi Foreign Trade College and problems of the teaching of commercial
letter writing.
Chapter 2 looks at some major theoretical problems and practical issues for
Specific Purpose English syllabus design and material production for the
teaching of commercial letter writing to commerce students at the Hanoi
Foreign Trade College.
Chapter 3 is a contrastive analysis of western commercial letters,
Vietnamese commercial letters in Vietnamese and Vietnamese commercial
letters in English.
Chapter 4 is an analysis of the results of a survey made in 1988 to identify
the needs of commerce students for commercial letters.
Chapter 5 is mainly concerned with designing a communicative syllabus for
the teaching of commercial letter writing to commerce students in Vietnam.
Chapter 6 is the proposed syllabus for the teaching of CLW to commerce
students at the HFTC, Vietnam.
Chapter 7 is the conclusion.
This Field Study Report should be regarded as an exploratory attempt to
adopt the communicative approach in designing a syllabus for the teaching
of commercial letter writing to commerce students in Vietnam.</field><field name="date">1990</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Vietnam</field><field name="subject">Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages</field><field name="subject">TESOL</field><field name="subject">commerce students</field><field name="subject">letter writing</field><field name="subject">Hanoi Foreign Trade College</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060704.115742</field></doc><doc><field name="title">"A gleam in the eye..." : An investigation : self-esteem of high school teachers in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) Government Schools</field><field name="creator">David, Veronica Anne</field><field name="description">This study attempted to investigate the
self-esteem of high school teachers in the Australian
Capital Territory (ACT). Its purpose was to measure the
self-esteem of high school teachers in the ACT, identify
perceptions of life-stage factors that might contribute
to teachers' self-esteem and to identify teachers'
perceptions of job-related factors that contribute to
their self-esteem.
The sample consisted of 219 teachers (94 male,
124 female, one of unidentified sex) in 12 of the 17 high
schools in the ACT. A questionnaire based on that used
by Swafford Jolley (1985) was used. It consisted of 4
parts - Part 1 demographic data, Part 2a Barksdale
Self-Esteem Index No. 69, Part 2b Life-stage
Characteristics, Part 3 Job-related characteristics, Part
4 - three related questions for open responses.
Data were analysed using the SPSSX data recording
and analysis system (Norusis 1983). Means and
differences between means were computed to establish
discrepancies. Pearson product moment correlations were
employed. Multiple linear regression analyses were used
to isolate the best predictors of self-esteem from among
the 34 work-related factors. A rank discrepancy index of
affect on self-esteem was also computed.
Findings show that eighty per cent of the
teachers may be hindered by low self-esteem. There is no
difference between male and female average age (39) nor
between the male and female average self-esteem index
(62.2). Younger teachers were found to be just as likely
to have low self-esteem as older teachers. The factors
which most affect teacher self-esteem and which are
closest to the ideal were found to be feelings of
competency as a teacher, pride in one's work,
establishment of specific personal goals and the
opportunity to determine one's own teaching methods. The
factors with the greatest discrepancies were found to be
the opportunity to advance professionally, positive
representation by the media and prestige of the teaching
profession.
It was concluded that in no one area are the
self-esteem needs of high school teachers in the
Australian Capital Territory being adequately met.
Responsibility lies with the individuals themselves and
with the ACT Schools Authority to work out joint ways of
enhancing teacher self-esteem and development. It is
argued that this cannot be left to chance by the
organisation but must be planned for as a matter of
urgency. Recognition of the individual is seen as the
key in any such planning but organisational objectives
also need to be considered.</field><field name="date">1988</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">self-esteem</field><field name="subject">high school teachers</field><field name="subject">Australian Capital Territory</field><field name="subject">ACT</field><field name="subject">government schools</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060704.120747</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An examination into the ability of cooperative multiplayer computer games as a means to facilitate group cohesion</field><field name="creator">Davidson, Rick</field><field name="description">From an organisational perspective, the potential benefits of enhancing workplace cohesion
are many, amongst which an increase in employee performance would be the most tangible
and possibly the most desirable. The primary aim of the present research was to explore
the capacity to increase levels of cohesion, and therefore facilitate team building, through
the use of cooperative multiplayer computer gaming (CMCG). Study 1, involving 26 male
and 23 female university students, required participants to play two, twenty minute, games
of the commercially available computer game QUAKE(tm) as teams of 3 or of 4, against an
equal number of computer generated artificial intelligence opposition. The interpersonal
attraction and task focus facets of Cohesion, as well as Stress and Mood State, were
measured using self-report questionnaires at both the pre- and post-test stages of the
experiment. Results supported the prediction that exposing individuals to a computer game
of a cooperative and interdependent nature would increase self-rated levels of cohesion, on
both the interpersonal attraction and task focus sub-scales. Study 2 aimed to expand upon
the findings of study 1, increasing the generalisability of the study 1 findings by surveying
existing teams engaging in CMCG via the Internet. Those surveyed were individuals who
currently played the Team Fortress module of QUAKE&#65533;, and who belonged to a Team
Fortress Clan - the CMCG equivalent of a social sporting team. Individuals playing
QUAKE(tm) via the Internet were found to be as cohesed with their team members as were
the laboratory participants after the CMCG intervention. Further, important group dynamic
factors evident in Team Fortress Clans, such as success being linked with higher levels of
cohesion, were consistent with literary considerations regarding conventional, non-CMCG
teams. Additional research exploration is required regarding the utility of CMCG,
however, the present research indicates that such an exploration is warranted and should
produce positive and practical results.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">group cohesion</field><field name="subject">cooperative multiplayer computer gaming</field><field name="subject">CMCG</field><field name="subject">team building</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060704.122645</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Exploration of the Structure-of-Intellect - Learning Abilities Test in the context of learning difficulties in a rural area of NSW</field><field name="creator">Cooper Davis, Pamela</field><field name="description">The Structure-of-Intellect - Learning Abilities Test (SOI-LA) (Meeker, 1975) has
an enthusiastic following in the USA, but is little-known in Australia.
It is based on the Structure-of-Intellect model of J P Guilford, and through a
series of up to 26 subtests, purports to identify 14 general learning abilities.
Forms are designed to cater for students from Kindergarten to adult.
In NSW, classroom teachers can have support for students with learning
difficulties through the Support Teacher program; this support often falls far
short of need, as there is a paucity of time and material resources.
There is a need for a tool which can identify areas of both strength and weakness
efficiently and suggest effective strategies to cater for the identified
weaknesses; the Meeker paradigm is purported to address this need with a
diagnostic approach which identifies learning disabilities which underlie and
serve to maintain school-based learning difficulties, and prescribes materials and
approaches for remediation.
This study explores the first part of the Meeker paradigm, the diagnostic approach
of the Structure-of-Intellect - Learning Abilities Test. This exploration is
undertaken in the context of four rural Support Teachers and their student with
learning difficulties from Grades 2-6. Rather than consider questions of the
Test's validity, this study was designed to explore the Test's utility in the
Support Teacher context, by giving the Support Teachers a working knowledge of the
concepts of SOI-LA, and to compare the application of their knowledge with the
information about their students' learning disabilities from the Test results.
Problems are evident with the Support Teachers' knowledge and understanding of
their students' disabilities; whist they felt comfortable about the approach
which the Test takes, they felt they did not know their students well enough to
make informed judgements about their disabilities. It was apparent from the study
that the Support Teachers' understanding of the concepts of the Test was
comparatively superficial, despite their impression that they did understand well.
Several difficulties with the instrument itself are highlighted by this study; the
assumptions underlying the derivation of the general ability scores are
questioned, and the suitability of Test Forms for a learning disabled population
of this age is open to criticism.
The Structure-of-Intellect - Learning Abilities Test may have utility as an
instrument for gaining information about a student's disability on an individual
basis, and may be best in the hands of the School Counsellor.</field><field name="date">1992</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Structure-of-Intellect - Learning Abilities Test</field><field name="subject">SOI-LA</field><field name="subject">learning difficulties</field><field name="subject">New South Wales</field><field name="subject">NSW</field><field name="subject">rural areas</field><field name="subject">Meeker</field><field name="subject">Guilford</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060704.123527</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The use of Coopersmith self-esteem inventory</field><field name="creator">Dawson, Caroline</field><field name="description">This study investigated whether the conditions in which the Coopersmith Self-Esteem
Inventory was administered had any effect on subjects' scores on the Inventory. The
study also examined normative and reliability scores in the ACT, the effect of various
demographic variables and the relationship between happiness scores and self-esteem.
The Coopersmith Self-Esteem Inventory was administered to groups of year seven
students from a Canberra high school under two different conditions: friendly and
impartial. After five weeks the Inventory was readministered to rearranged groups under
the different conditions. No significant differences were found in the scores from the
students in the different conditions. No significant differences were found on an
indication of student happiness under each condition.
A normative value was calculated combining scores from the first testing sessions and
a test-retest reliability correlation calculated from combined scores from the first and
second testing sessions.
The validity of the lie scale and the use of the Inventory in Australia are discussed.
With a few reservations it appears that the Coopersmith Self-Esteem Inventory measures a
relatively stable trait and is a reliable measure of overall self-esteem. A summary of recent
literature using the Coopersmith Self-Esteem Inventory is included.
Mean self-esteem scores on the Coopersmith Self-Esteem Inventory were compared
with students grouped by sex, socio-economic status, birth order, whether they came
from a single parent family or whether their mother worked. Significant differences were
found with SES and birth order but recent literature shows that these variables are often
interrelated and results may be instrument dependent. New self-concept tests (based on a
sound theoretical framework) are being developed which acknowledge the
multidimensionality of self-concept and appear more able to detect variation in facets of
self-concept.</field><field name="date">1987</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Coopersmith Coopersmith self-esteem inventory</field><field name="subject">Australian Capital Territory</field><field name="subject">ACT</field><field name="subject">high schools</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060704.125254</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A gender analysis of the employment profile of the A.C.T. Department of Education between 1976 and 1991</field><field name="creator">Dawson, Elizabeth</field><field name="description">The purpose of this study is to discover if there has been quantitative
change in the gender balance of the employment profile of the ACT
Department of Education from 1976 to 1991 and to explore possible reasons
for such change.
It should be noted that the Department has had several changes of
name over the period covered by this study including the ACT Department
of Education, the ACT Department of Health, Education and the Arts, and it
is presently known as the ACT Department of Education and Training. For
the sake of clarity it will be referred to throughout as the ACT Department of
Education.
The employment configuration will be studied from 1976, the earliest
year of available data, to 1991 to measure relative changes in the position of
men and women. This paper will examine significant events in the ACT
Education system, in particular the introduction of Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) legislation in 1984, to determine whether the
introduction of legislation and/or other initiatives brought about moves
toward Equal Employment Opportunity for women.
The study will develop and consider hypotheses and examine several
theoretical explanations for the changes or lack of them in the position of
men and women. Recommendations will be made concerning future
directions for research and action to achieve equal employment opportunity
for women, the largest group of the four groups targeted in the EEO
legislation.
The central argument of the study is that the adoption of quantitative
approaches to measure success/failure in EEO programs is of limited use.
These theoretical approaches, largely informed by liberal feminism, offer
inadequate understanding of the resistances to change. Other theoretical
perspectives are needed if the issue is seen as "what are the resistances and
what are the policies and strategies that can be developed to overcome
them?".
Feminist critical theory, however, enables more productive questions
to be raised about how social power is constructed and maintained, about
hegemonic culture, and about the language and cultural biases embedded in
administrative structures in education. Insights thus gained into issues,
events and resistances give individuals and groups agency, the power to act
for change.</field><field name="date">1994</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">gender analysis</field><field name="subject">employment profile</field><field name="subject">Australian Capital Territory</field><field name="subject">ACT</field><field name="subject">Department of Education</field><field name="subject">Equal Employment Opportunity</field><field name="subject">EEO</field><field name="subject">feminist critical theory</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060704.130917</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Moves towards privatisation of Australia's Defence industries</field><field name="creator">Delmore, Colin</field><field name="description">The degree and nature of government involvement in the production of war
materials has changed markedly in recent years. This dissertation traces
events that have occurred and the background to these. It attempts to put
in context, changes that have taken place particularly over the past decade,
and which to date have not been placed in a connected sequence or
described as part of an overall plan.
The dissertation commences with a brief outline of the growth of defence
industry in Australia and its subsequent decline in size and performance
during the last forty years. From this base, it looks at options which faced
governments at the beginning of the 1980's, decisions which were made,
and the reasons for those decisions. It then goes on to examine whether the
"best" options were followed from a number of viewpoints. These include
defence strategic considerations, matters of probity and equity in the
disposal of assets, (particularly the public good), as well as the impact on
those affected by the decision. The process of change, including the extent
to which decisions and their effects were scrutinised by external and
auditing agencies, is then considered. The experience in this country has to
a large extent paralleled, although lagged, that in the United Kingdom.
Accordingly, appropriate references are brought from the UK experience to
highlight alternatives to, or weaknesses of, the processes followed and
policies implemented locally.
Finally, the essay provides some discussion of the benefits and costs
which have been observed so far, as well as postulating options which may
be taken in Australia as the process of change continues.</field><field name="date">1990</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">defence industries</field><field name="subject">privatisation</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060704.132456</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An analysis of the military engineering logistics planning problem</field><field name="creator">Denham, David R.</field><field name="description">Logistics is defined in the Concise Oxford
Dictionary as "the art of moving and quartering troops,
and supplying and maintaining a fleet". While this
definition is rather narrow, it nevertheless gives a
general guide to the broad military support field known
as logistics. This thesis is concerned with one of the
more complex military logistics problems - namely the
allocation of men, equipment and materiel to the engineer
tasks associated with the movement, maintenance and
support of military forces in a theatre of operations.
The major factors are:
a. tasks to be carried out by engineers;
b. the number and type of available
engineer construction units.
c. stores and transport constraints imposed
by other agencies in the Defence logistics
system;
d. deadlines imposed by the Commander and his
staff;
e. efficiency and proficiency of engineer
constructions units in carrying out
particular tasks;
f. risk, including
(1) possible enemy action (both directly
against units, or indirectly against
other elements in the logistics system)
(2) adverse weather (both direct and indirect)
Current military procedures for solving this
type of problem are based on practices developed during
World War II, and rely heavily on support from external
sources (this was the case throughout the conflicts in
Korea, Malaya and Vietnam). The recent change in Government
defence policy requiring greater reliance on our own
resources has meant that new solutions have had to be
found to old problems. The aim of this thesis is therefore
three-fold:
a. to analyse the problem in terms of
its various components;
b. to develop a method whereby the problem
can be solved manually in an efficient
manner (but still considering all the
relevant factors); and
c. to develop a method whereby the solution
to the problem can be optimized, using
computers where necessary.
Mathematical equations are developed for all factors in
the engineer logistics planning problem, and a graphical
technique is developed which enables a solution to the
problem to be found quickly using manual methods.
The approach to-the development of the graphical technique
is based on some ideas presented by V.V. Kolbin in his
book "Stochastic Programming".</field><field name="date">1982</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">military engineering logistics</field><field name="subject">engineers</field><field name="subject">V.V.

As ideal
learning environments for young children they have the potential to facilitate very special
educational interactions, yet children's experiences in house museums remain relatively
unexplored, with very little professional analysis of the nature, the value or the impact of
school visits. As museums, historic houses are educational institutions, yet with limited
professional expertise and restricted resources as commonplace, many house museums
provide very little in the way of structured educational experiences for schools. This
study aims to increase our understanding of educational encounters in house museums.
Using Falk and Dierking's Interactive Experience Model this thesis explores the personal,
physical and social contexts of young children's visits to house museums. It follows the
progress of children aged 5-8 years, as they participate in class visits to two very
different kinds of house museum. A structured, age-appropriate education program
implemented at Calthorpes' House is compared to the approach taken at Blundells'
Cottage, where a lack of resources and professional expertise has resulted in unstructured
school visits, typical of amateur house museums throughout Australia. The study directly
compares these structured and non-structured museum visits to determine the immediate
and long term value of constructed learning experiences in historic houses. The thesis
concludes that the structure of a school visit has a significant influence on the museum
experience. Research revealed that structured education programs prepare children better
for their visit, allow for more successful interactive experiences on site, encourage
enjoyable social interactions and result in more detailed museum memories. Finally this
thesis outlines implications for house museums as a result of this research and makes
recommendations to assist under-resourced house museums provide more structured,
more informed educational interactions for schools.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">historic house museums</field><field name="subject">children</field><field name="subject">historic houses</field><field name="subject">Interactive Experience Model</field><field name="subject">Calthorpes' House</field><field name="subject">Blundells' Cottage</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060704.151238</field></doc><doc><field name="title">When is conflict useful? : reassessing conflict in the lives of adolscents and their families</field><field name="creator">de Souza, Susan</field><field name="description">The study sought to examine tactics used in family conflict and the relationship between

of Piaget's stages of cognitive development, and Rosenberg's Self-esteem Scale (1965),
no significant differences were found between cognitive development and conflict tactics,
self esteem or gender. Adolescents from violent families had lower self-esteem than those

received with enthusiasm, having broad implications
for the Musee.
Following the two months as a contract conservator
in Vienna, research developments were applied
in practice, under severe time constraints and the
resulting treatment was successfully achieved with
the wholehearted support and co-operation of staff
and officials, resulting in offers of lectureships
and lecture tours for the Academy of Fine Arts -
Conservation School, Vienna in Austria and Germany.
In evaluative terms, it is considered that the
programme met the objectives very well, and in addition
the results have potential for part of an ongoing
programme of research into fire-damaged paintings and
varnish removal, with solid lines of co-operation in
the establishments in Europe.</field><field name="date">1983</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Musee d'art et d'histoire</field><field name="subject">internship</field><field name="subject">European Conservation Centres</field><field name="subject">Academy of Fine Arts Conservation School Vienna</field><field name="subject">fire-damaged paintings</field><field name="subject">varnish removal</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060704.162140</field></doc><doc><field name="title">People's participation in rural development in Sri Lanka : the case of Anuradhapura district</field><field name="creator">Dissanayake, H. M. Mallika</field><field name="description">This thesis deals with the question of people's participation in rural development in Sri Lanka
with specific reference to the district of Anuradhapura.
When we consider people's participation in rural development it is essential to understand the
meanings attached to the concepts of development, rural development, participation and
decentralization. Therefore, Chapter 2 of this thesis concentrates on these concepts.
The nature and degree of people's participation depends in great part on the socio-economic and
cultural aspects of the people who live in the region or the area. Therefore, Chapter 3 deals with
the significance of the rural sector in Sri Lanka and investigates income levels, nutritional status
and employment, the village society, and the socio-cultural patterns of Sri Lanka. This chapter
especially considers the socio-economic and cultural situation which effects people's participation
in Sri Lanka.
The importance of rural development is discussed in Chapter 4. This chapter explains the scope
of rural development in Sri Lanka. In this case the chapter concentrates on the history of rural
development, decentralization, and integrated rural development programmes. Also it describes
the organizations which already exist in the rural sector in Sri Lanka.
Chapter 5 discusses Anuradhapura district as a case study and it mainly deals with the situation
and basic features, such as agriculture, economy, population, education and labour force. Also, it
describes the administrative structure of the district with special attention to political structure,
Kachcheri and divisions, other departments and the Buddhists temple.
Institutional capacity and effective participation in Anuradhapura district is discussed in Chapter
6 in order to analyse the effectiveness of organizations in the district. To achieve this objective
Chapter 6 discusses the integrated rural development project in Anuradhapura district and the
reasons for people's non-participation in it.
The thesis concludes that people's participation is an essential ingredient of successful rural
development in Sri Lanka but there are a number of constraints. Some recommendations to
promote the people's participation are given in the conclusion.</field><field name="date">1992</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">rural development</field><field name="subject">Sri Lanka</field><field name="subject">Anuradhapura district</field><field name="subject">decentralization</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060704.163914</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A profile of the adult numeracy student in the Australian Capital Territory</field><field name="creator">Divett, Vicky</field><field name="description">n/a</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australian Capital Territory</field><field name="subject">ACT</field><field name="subject">numeracy</field><field name="subject">adult learners</field><field name="subject">mathematics</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060704.164546</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Continuous enrolment policy : a study of transition from preschool to primary school in the ACT</field><field name="creator">Dixon, Dalma</field><field name="description">Since its inception the A.C.T. Schools Authority has
implemented a number of changes in attempts to meet its
aim to provide high quality programmes for children.
In the case of enrolment policy the decision to change
to continuous enrolment was made in many schools less on
educational grounds than as a result of economic and
political pressures. However, any policy which has an
impact on children's learning in schools must be
examined in the light of its educational implications.
This study attempts to do this. It attempts to assess
the policy on educational grounds with a particular
focus on the programmes offered to individual children
and the day to day problems encountered by teachers who
attempt to implement the policy.</field><field name="date">1987</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ACT Schools Authority</field><field name="subject">preschools</field><field name="subject">primary schools</field><field name="subject">Australian Capital Territory</field><field name="subject">enrolment policy</field><field name="subject">continuous enrolment</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060705.094737</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reading academic English at postgraduate level, Bogor Institute of Agriculture, Indonesia</field><field name="creator">Djauhari, Muhamad Thonthowi</field><field name="description">This study, within the framework of improving the English course for
postgraduate level at IPB (Bogor Institute of Agriculture), attempts to determine
the extent of English reading activities for academic purposes expected by
agricultural teaching staff at post graduate level, different expectations across the
study programs or a particular area of specialised discipline, the extent of English
problems experienced by postgraduate students and the strategies used to cope
with English needs in their postgraduate studies, to test a hypothesis that there is
a positive correlation between the students' command/scores of English and their
achievements/scores in agricultural subjects.
Questionnaires for agricultural staff and students were adapted from
Hughes (1988) and Weir (1988) to address these questions. Students' academic
records were obtained to compute the correlation between scores in English and
agricultural subjects. Review of literature and research in current theories of
reading in EFL is given to serve as a theoretical foundation to discuss English
reading lessons from secondary level to tertiary level in Indonesia and to provide
general implications to improve the English course at IPB.
The results indicate that staff reading expectation in English is high in
comparison to the students' level of English and in that all eight types of reading
activities listed in the questionnaires were expected. There are some different
expectations across the study programs. However, the most relevant finding to
note in regard to the the English course is that reading English texts as review of
literature for research proposes and reading English texts for writing assignments
were expected across all the study programs.
It is also found that reading English texts for academic purposes was still
a problem for the majority of student respondents and there are various
interesting reading strategies used by the student to cope with the English needs
of their studies. However, further investigation is essential to assist the students
with reading problems since the results do not specify the nature of reading
problems and methods used by the respondents.
A significant correlation is found between scores in English and
agricultural subjects at the level of 5% and 1% by the Spearman rank- order and
the Pearson product-moment correlation formulas. This implies that English is
central to the students' success in their postgraduate studies, which is also
supported by the student respondents' opinions. General implications and
suggestions are provided to assist postgraduate with reading problems and to
improve the English course for the students.</field><field name="date">1991</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bogor Institute of Agriculture</field><field name="subject">IPB</field><field name="subject">postgraduate teaching</field><field name="subject">academic English</field><field name="subject">TESOL</field><field name="subject">Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060705.100939</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Teaching advanced reading in the Institute of International Relations in Hanoi</field><field name="creator">Doan, Duong Van</field><field name="description">This study deals with reading problems faced by
the advanced level students in the Institute of International Relations (I.I.R.) in Hanoi. It seeks to identify ways in
which the teachers there can help their students to read
authentic texts in English with a high level of
comprehension.
The study begins with a description of the
training of the young diplomats and researchers. It
considers the problems faced by the teachers and students,
and looks into the role of English in general and English
reading comprehension in particular in the I.I.R.
Bearing in mind the objectives of the training,
the study discusses the goals for teaching reading
comprehension at an advanced level and lays emphasis on the
importance of using appropriate techniques for teaching
reading skills at this level.
The writer of the study also looks at the
relevant issues in theories of reading comprehension which
are discussed in current literature. These theoretical
issues are then related to the reality of teaching in the
I.I.R.
Finally, to illustrate all the techniques and
skills for teaching reading comprehension which have been
dealt with earlier in the study, the writer presents a
sample reading lesson. It is his hope that the presentation,
and indeed the whole study, will be of value to his
colleagues at the I.I.R., and to others who teach reading in
similar situations.</field><field name="date">1988</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Institute of International Relations.

J.</field><field name="description">The study's primary purpose was, through the recorded
observations of a Regional Education Officer (REO) working in Catholic
primary schools over eighteen months, to draw out implications for local
and central administrators for the maintenance and improvement of the
schools' quality. Of particular interest was the question that since the
schools were Catholic schools, would or should this make any
significant difference to these implications. A secondary purpose of the
study was the clarification and articulation for myself of what the main
elements of the REO role might best be in practice.
Analysis of diary entries and relevant Catholic Education Office
documents was based on the writer's fundamental assumption that the
merits of educational administrative decisions and actions should be
judged in relation to the benefit these are to teachers and their students.
The main conclusions of the study were:
i) that the recognition by administrators of the special qualities of
the personal and interpersonal relationships existing in schools would
assist administrators in maintaining and developing the schools'
quality;
ii) that the religious faith aspect of the ideals of a Catholic school
adds a deeper dimension to the special qualities of the personal and
interpersonal relationships which are common to schools;
iii) that such are the demands by staffs of schools for support and
assistance, that the only ones who can realistically meet the bulk of such
demands are staffs themselves, supporting and assisting each other
through some form of regular collegial system;
iv) that schools are more non-rational than rational
organizations, and hence an emphasis on bureaucratic administrative
processes will be detrimental to schools' effectiveness.</field><field name="date">1990</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Regional Education Officer</field><field name="subject">REO</field><field name="subject">catholic primary schools</field><field name="subject">school administrators</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060705.122459</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The development and role of the Australian Capital Territory Secondary Principals' Council</field><field name="creator">Dooley, Brian John</field><field name="description">This study attempts to trace the development of the Australian Capital Territory Secondary Principals' Council (SPC) from the midfifties
to the late seventies. The dramatic change from the monolithic
centralised New South Wales state education system to one of autonomous
school-based decision making of the new ACT School Authority forms the
background on which this study is developed.
The changing fortunes of the SPC as a pressure group are followed
from their prestigious days with the NSW school inspector to the depths
of the conflicts of the early seventies when change towards autonomy
was imminent. The Teachers' Federation, at this time, gained power at
the expense of the SPC when the union demanded that it be the sole
spokesman for ACT teachers.
The multiplicity of problems confronting the SPC in the late sixties
and early seventies resulted in the forming of the Preservation of
Principals Society (POPS), which conducted certain activities to allow
principals to get away from such pressures.
The gradual gaining of acceptance, within this new task environment,
by the SPC saw it become an expert unit within this participative model.
SPC members are on many committees which function to improve the
administration, the curricula, and other major facets of ACT education.
Finally, this study culminates in the SPC formulating a set of
goals to guide its operations in the future. Tentative recommendations
for Council to consider form a conclusion. These are to:
1. convince the ACT Legislative Assembly that the SPC is an
expert body which should be heeded when the Assembly
assumes control of local education, and
2. act as a group to monitor the curricula of their schools
to ensure that a relevant education is available for the
next generation.
Principals should initiate change for the future rather than react to
the problems of the past.</field><field name="date">1977</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australian Capital Territory Secondary Principals' Council</field><field name="subject">SPC</field><field name="subject">ACT</field><field name="subject">secondary schools</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060705.125034</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Peer perception of the intellectually handicapped</field><field name="creator">Dornan, Don</field><field name="description">In 1980 Jackson and Knowles presented a paper at the
Australian Group for the Study of Mental Deficiency [A.G.S.O.M.D.] conference in Launceston, Tasmania. The paper,
titled "Primary School Children's Perceptions and Understandings
of Mental Retardation", reported in detail responses on twenty
questions from the sixty-three item questionnaire instrument used
in their study. These twenty questions reflected stereotyped
responses of an alarming nature. If these responses were a
reflection of how Australian children generally thought, then
integration of the intellectually handicapped child into
mainstream classes would be counter productive.
The current study was initiated to help assess the attitudes
of Australian Capital Territory children to the Intellectually
Handicapped. The twenty significant questions from the Tasmanian
study were formed into a questionnaire and administered to 769
children in Years 3 and 6 from six Government and two Catholic
schools in the Australian Capital Territory. In most cases the
results were in direct contrast to those obtained in Tasmania.
At first glance this meant that the attitudes of Australian
Capital Territory children towards the Intellectually Handicapped
were much less stereotyped than those of Tasmanian children.
Further investigation, however, led to the discovery that the
results from the Tasmanian study were spurious. The date had not
been accurately computerized, giving a result that was probably
the reverse of what Tasmanian children actually thought.
Four supplementary hypotheses, comparing the responses of
Years 3 and 6 girls and boys, Government and Private schools,
exposed and unexposed schools, were tested. The analysis of the
data for these hypotheses supported, to some degree, past
findings that older children and girls have less stereotyped
attitudes towards the Intellectually Handicapped than younger
children and boys. The responses of Government schools versus
Private schools were varied. Three of the five significantly
different responses indicated a less stereotyped view was held by
Government school children, while two of these significant
questions indicated a less stereotyped view was held by Private
school children. With regard to exposed and unexposed schools,
the two significantly different responses indicated less
stereotyped views were held by the nonexposed children.

order to describe and assess its developing organisational culture. The following
questions provide the major focus of the study: I How and to what extent does
the Vision Statement describe the developing Catholic school culture at St Clare of Assisi Primary School? 2. What are the common beliefs and values underlying
the Vision Statement at St Clare of Assisi Primary School?
A review of the literature reveals that many educational researchers stress the
importance of schools developing a strong, coordinated, cohesive and positive
culture. The need for this culture to be based on a clearly articulated vision,
embodying shared values and beliefs is also indicated and this provides the
rationale for the study.
A number of frameworks for school culture are examined and adapted to develop
a conceptual framework for the study. The resulting Model for Developing
Catholic School Culture provides a structure which enables collected data to be
sorted and analysed, so that the research questions can be addressed.
This study utilises the methodology of ethnographic research. Data collection
strategies include participant observation, interviews, surveys, and other sources
including school records and documents, photographs, artefacts and memorabilia.
The findings are organised under five headings, each of which represents a belief
articulated in the school's Vision Statement. These beliefs are examined to see
how they are enacted verbally, visually and behaviourally by the school
community Conclusions are drawn as to the relevance of the Vision Statement to
the school community Other significant values and beliefs evident from an
examination of the data are also identified
The study concludes that the Vision Statement effectively describes the developing
culture of the school for there is congruence between its beliefs and actions.
What emerges of particular significance from this study is the importance of a
school community articulating a shared vision. A school's Vision Statement serves
a dual purpose It is the filter which allows the shared beliefs and values of the
school community to be articulated, while at the same time serving as a scaffold
for checking if these shared beliefs and values are being enacted by the
community.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">catholic primary schools</field><field name="subject">vision statements</field><field name="subject">St Clare of Assisi Primary School</field><field name="subject">Australian Capital Territory</field><field name="subject">ACT</field><field name="subject">school culture</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060705.145541</field></doc></add>
