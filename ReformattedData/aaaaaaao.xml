As in other developing countries that find it impossible to achieve &#8216;health for all&#8217; through western medical services alone, the idea of developing an integrated health system, one that incorporates traditional medicine, has been proposed as a way of addressing poor health status. The idea of developing an integrated health system in PNG is not new but only recently has it translated into action with tangible results including a draft &#8216;National Policy on Traditional Medicine for Papua New Guinea&#8217;. Over many years researchers have bemoaned the paucity of information on cultural beliefs and treatment practices that could make the incorporation of traditional medicine into the health system, along the lines proposed in the National Policy, better informed. To date this information gap has not been filled.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Papua New Guinea, health indicators, developing countries, integrated health system, traditional medicine, national policy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=128273</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Immigration detention, containment fantasies and the gendering of political status in Australia</field><field name="creator">Phillips, Kristen</field><field name="description">This thesis is about border politics, in more than one sense. It looks at the recent period of anxiety about the control of Australian national borders (approximately, from the late 1990s until the 2007 Federal election), and attempts to understand how certain assumptions about women as potential reproductive bodies permeated biopolitical discourses in Australian national culture during this period. I employ the term &#8216;containment&#8217; in order to make sense of this cultural moment. With reference to the work of theorists of modernity such as Michel Foucault and Zygmunt Bauman, I argue that containment is a key discourse in modern cultures&#8212;a way of thinking and speaking about confinement, control, management and order. It structures how we think about the management of populations and is a central part of the justification for the confinement of problem populations by modern political authorities. As such, then, it describes the ways in which the use of immigration detention for unlawful non-citizen asylum seekers has been thought about and accepted as reasonable in Australian national culture.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">border politics, Australian national borders, containment, Michel Foucault, Zygmunt Bauman, immigration detention, political authorities, national reproduction management</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=129031</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Methodology for capturing environmental, social and economic implications of industrial symbiosis in heavy industrial areas</field><field name="creator">Kurup, Biji R.</field><field name="description">Industrial operations have been attributed to causing social and environmental problems such as: acid rain; greenhouse gas emissions, air, water and soil pollution; plus health problems to neighbourhood communities. With the 3P (people, planet, profit) approach for sustainability as the background, there have been movements to establish the concept of eco-industrial development in existing or new industrial areas from the planning stage onwards. Industrial ecology (IE) is the operation of an industrial ecosystem which is based on the principles of operation of a natural ecosystem. Industrial symbiosis (IS), one of the principal applications of IE, is defined as inter-firm collaboration, where a network of industries collaborates in exchange of products, by-products, information, resources and wastes to reduce their collective environmental footprint to achieve mutual benefits.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">eco-industrial development, 3P (people, planet, profit) approach, industrial ecosystem, natural ecosystem, industrial symbiosis, social and environmental problems</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=128365</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigation of pressure and saturation effects on elastic parameters: an integrated approach to improve time-lapse interpretation</field><field name="creator">Grochau, Marcos Hexsel</field><field name="description">Time-lapse seismic is a modern technology for monitoring production-induced changes in and around a hydrocarbon reservoir. Time-lapse (4D) seismic may help locate undrained areas, monitor pore fluid changes and identify reservoir compartmentalization.

Perhaps the most important are to perform quantitative time-lapse and to model and interpret time-lapse effects in thin layers. The former requires one to quantify saturation and pressure effects on rock elastic parameters.

Among all the others, uncontrolled utilization of water poses a severe threat to the coming generations. Past decades have witnessed water shortage in various countries of the world. Although about 80% of the earth&#8217;s surface is covered with water, around 97.2% of water is salty making it inappropriate for general usage. Among the rest of the 2.8%, which is present as fresh water on surface, a large proportion of it has been found to be severely polluted. The increasing demand of fresh water both for industrial and domestic usage adds great demand on the available groundwater. Moreover, the severe pollution of fresh water on the surface adds more stress on the available groundwater. In Australia, approximately 20% of water supply is from groundwater and in the case of Western Australia groundwater provides two thirds of its water supply needs. Thus, it is important to manage groundwater sources in Western Australia to achieve the optimum water utilization and maintain the water table and it is also essential to decide on an appropriate water budget. Groundwater flow modelling is an effective tool to get appropriate water distribution and, to examine effects from pumping on water levels and direction of groundwater flow paths, thereby helping in its proper management and utilization. Apart from monitoring the flow and utilization, groundwater flow modeling is also vital to keep the track of pollutant in the groundwater. Increasing surface pollution and landfill sites tend to pollute the groundwater due to leaching.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">groundwater flow model, soil types, Perth region, contaminated site model, benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylene, transport, unconfined aquifer</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=119756</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of optimization problems involving stochastic systems with jumps</field><field name="creator">Liu, Chunmin</field><field name="description">The optimization problems involving stochastic systems are often encountered in financial systems, networks design and routing, supply-chain management, actuarial science, telecommunications systems, statistical pattern recognition analysis associated with electronic commerce and medical diagnosis.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">stochastic systems with jumps, optimization problems, computational methods</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=120231</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effects of different cutting heights, mulching and burning on the control of bellyache bush (jatropha gossypifolia L.) applicable in East Timor</field><field name="creator">Guterres, Acacio da Costa</field><field name="description">Since bellyache bush invaded to East Timor it has significantly reduced crop and animal production and consequential loss of income from farm enterprises.

It is a conversational mapping of embodied space and time as they re-imagine memories and actual experiences which have informed their changing sense of self during the transitional stages of menopause. The research examines the ways in which artwork, visual diaries, journals, creative writing and poetry make visible a fresh perception of their female sense of the lived body. The project examines the contemporary cultural meanings of femininity, sexuality and identity which have informed women's understanding of their bodies and gender during the transformative years of menopause, and it explores the ways in which these forms of knowledge have influenced their artistic modes of self-representation.In the first chapter I acquaint the reader with the context of the research, and outline my understandings of the human body and social theories. I direct the exploration of texts towards a range of feminist theoretical perspectives which suggest women's biological and reproductive bodies provide spaces for re-visioning personal and social change.The next two chapters explain how I develop theoretical and methodological arts-based approaches enabling an innovative and appropriate investigation of the phenomenon in question. I explain how I have blended various textual expressive genres with interpretive research methodologies and philosophical viewpoints. In these chapters I recount the imaginative strategies and techniques used to portray the ontological, phenomenological and epistemological perspectives of the lived experience of menopause.Following this, I present seven stories.

Developing strategies for their management requires a range of information that is often impractical to collect from ground based surveys. In other cases, such as retrospective analyses of historical invasion rates and patterns, data is rarely, if ever, available from such surveys. Instead, historical archives of remotely sensed imagery provides one of the only existing records, and are used in this research to determine invasion rates and reconstruct invasion patterns of a ca 70 year old exotic mesquite population (Leguminoseae: Prosopis spp.) in the Pilbara Region of Western Australia, thereby helping to identify ways to reduce spread and infill. A model was then developed using this, and other, information to predict which parts of the Pilbara are most a risk. This information can assist in identifying areas requiring the most vigilant intervention and pre-emptive measures. Precise information of the location and areal extent of an invasive species is also crucial for land managers and policy makers for crafting management strategies aimed at control, confinement or eradication of some or all of the population. Therefore, the third component of this research was to develop and test high spectral and spatial resolution airborne imagery as a potential monitoring tool for tracking changes at various intervals and quantifying the effectiveness of management strategies adopted. To this end, high spatial resolution digital multispectral imagery (4 channels, 1 m spatial resolution) and hyperspectral imagery (126 channels, 3 m spatial resolution) was acquired and compared for its potential for distinguishing mesquite from coexisting species and land covers.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">mesquite invasion, Pilbara region, Western Australia, invasive plants, prosopis spp</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=118290</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Success factors for new business start-up in Hong Kong: a study of the external networks of small business start-up</field><field name="creator">Ma, Victor Kee Kin</field><field name="description">Most small new firms face problems in surviving the gestation process and achieving a viable performance thereafter because of the very fact of their smallness and newness.

Consequently, the purpose of this study was to investigate the likely relationships between four independent constructs (1. market size, 2. labour cost, 3. infrastructure, and 4. business ethics) in China and the intensity of foreign investment from Western Australia, and to evaluate if and how these relationships are mediated by personality attributes (i.e., gender), organisational properties (i.e., size), and networking.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">China, economic power, East Asia region, foreign investment, Hong Kong, Korea, Taiwan</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=119755</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">"One time ago": an urban Aboriginal tribalography</field><field name="creator">Butler, Julianne</field><field name="description">Masters Research - Master of Social Science</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Aboriginal tribalography</field><field name="subject">kinship</field><field name="subject">Indigenous people</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1959.13/38345</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Airway inflammation in school-aged children with asthma</field><field name="creator">Nguyen, Thi Dieu Thuy</field><field name="description">Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD)</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">airway inflammation</field><field name="subject">children with asthma</field><field name="subject">environmental tobacco smoke</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1959.13/38348</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ab Initio investigation of the electronic structure and rovibrational spectroscopy of group-I and II metal hydrides and helides</field><field name="creator">Page, Alister J.</field><field name="description">Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD)</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Ion-quadrupole interaction</field><field name="subject">CCSD(T)</field><field name="subject">rovibrational spectrum</field><field name="subject">MRCI</field><field name="subject">excited states</field><field name="subject">molecular hydride cation</field><field name="subject">molecular helide cation</field><field name="subject">hydrogen chemistry</field><field name="subject">helium chemistry</field><field name="subject">Eckart-Watson Hamiltonian</field><field name="subject">vibrational spectrum</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1959.13/38359</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Semigroup C* crossed products and Toeplitz algebras</field><field name="creator">Ahmed, Mamoon Ali</field><field name="description">Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD)</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">C* algebras</field><field name="subject">Toeplitz algebra</field><field name="subject">crossed products</field><field name="subject">short exact sequences</field><field name="subject">lattice ordered groups</field><field name="subject">ideals</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1959.13/38366</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of local government in the conservation of biodiversity</field><field name="creator">Kelly, Andrew Harley Heron</field><field name="description">This thesis comprises a critical review of the role of Local Government in the conservation of biological diversity (or &#8216;biodiversity&#8217;). Whilst the vast majority of the text relates to NSW, much of the broader commentary may extend to other Australian jurisdictions. The nub of the thesis is that despite the rhetoric in key documents &#8211; including the National Strategy for the Conservation of Australia&#8217;s Biological Diversity, the NSW Biodiversity Strategy, the National Local Government Biodiversity Strategy and various plans and policies made at the municipal level &#8211; the outlook is grim without fundamental policy, legal and fiscal change. The topic is huge but crucial to any person concerned about the mammoth decline of biodiversity in Australia. Whilst being intrinsically transdisciplinary in nature, the thesis attempts to contribute to the &#8216;new production of knowledge&#8217;.&#185; It raises issues, problems, ideas and recommendations. The work is based on: &#8226; A literary search until 2001. The long gap between this date and thesis submission is due to a severe illness suffered by the author, which arose in late Dec 2001.&#178; &#8226; Empirical research into: o nine 1998/1999 &#8216;state of environment&#8217; reports prepared for by councils located roughly in or around the &#8216;NSW South-western Slopes&#8217; bioregion that is recognised for the extremely limited extent of remnant native vegetation; o conservation related clauses in all gazetted &#8216;comprehensive&#8217; Local Environmental Plans - i.e. those applying to entire Local Government areas - prepared by councils between 1995 and 2000 inclusively and which remain in force; &#8226; Personal discussion with various officials and onlookers directly involved in, or concerned about, biodiversity conservation at the municipal level. Brief summaries of each chapter are provided herein. The introduction initiates discussion on (i) the meaning of &#8216;biodiversity&#8217;, including its shift from a scientific concept to a populist expression, (ii) the position of councils in Australian government and (iii) the significance of biodiversity conservation at the local sphere. It also introduces two related concepts that are met throughout the thesis, which arguably erode council conservation capability: Local Government&#8217;s &#8216;historical and cultural baggage&#8217; and the &#8216;ratepayer ideology&#8217;. The following three chapters provide the &#8216;historical and institutional&#8217; context. Chapter Two focuses on changing societal perspectives towards the biophysical environment, together with resultant statutory and environmental trends that have paralleled the advancement of Local Government. Chapter Three traces the history of NSW Local Government, demonstrating its entrenchment in the political landscape. It examines major changes, especially functional expansion and managerial reform. Chapter Four scrutinises a particular aspect of municipal experience, namely top-down and bottom-up cooperation between neighbouring councils. This chapter adds consideration of state appointed regional bodies that may arguably sideline Local Government. The regional context is fundamental to environmental management due to the inappropriateness of many council boundaries. The next three chapters concentrate on legislative and financial detail. Chapter Five reviews the Local Government Act 1993 (NSW), which provides wide service powers, limited regulatory opportunity and special requirements for council-owned land. Chapter Six explores the land-use planning system under the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979 (NSW), especially the ongoing influence of its urban background. It raises the perennial influence of &#8216;developmentalism&#8217; in the determination of applications for development, which directly benefits property interests. Recent statutory change, especially in relation to &#8216;threatened species&#8217; law, may do little more than support informed habitat destruction. A closely related matter is funding, as discussed throughout Chapter Seven. The issue goes beyond insufficiency. It is argued that Local Government&#8217;s primary financial source - i.e. rating, a property tax - works against biodiversity conservation. Not only is there no policy rationale to support rating in the conservation context but the system can provide a &#8216;perverse incentive&#8217; to rural landholders to clear their lands. This problem is exacerbated by the type of valuation and differential rates. The system demands major overhaul, including consideration of increased conditional Commonwealth funding. The following two chapters relate to attitudes towards the biophysical environment that are popular amongst the general community. Chapter Eight considers the provision of vegetated, passive recreational open space whilst Chapter Nine deals with securing and enhancing local amenity. These approaches, however, can be directly inconsistent with biodiversity conservation. Parochial &#8216;green&#8217; desires of local constituents can lead to environmental damage. Notwithstanding this, Chapter Ten provides some impressive examples of Local Government supporting biodiversity conservation. But these are isolated and rely on committed individuals. Whilst the pervasive prospect throughout this thesis is one of gloom, the concluding chapter builds on previous discussion by presenting ideas and recommendations to improve the role of Local Government in conserving biodiversity. It emphasises the need for regional approaches, improved funding mechanisms and fresh visions. Councils with bigger areas, supported by community structures to maintain &#8216;grass roots&#8217; public participation, together with massive change to Local Government funding, may provide a desirable path for municipal reform and retention of Australia&#8217;s precious biodiversity.

These systems have been proven as powerful and versatile computational tools for solving certain types of problems that are too complex to be analyzed with traditional analytical means. Inspired by the computational mechanism of the human brain, many researchers have looked into neurobiology for new inspiration to solve more complex problems than those based on traditional computational techniques. Artificial neural networks, evolving from neuro-biological insights, give computer systems an amazing capability to actually learn from input data to generate solutions for problems that are too abstract to be understood or too resource-intensive to tackle. Although neural networks have been applied with success in many industries, there is a continuing demand for new types of hierarchical artificial neural networks that can overcome some of the drawbacks of the earlier models. This thesis presents a new class of convolutional neural networks based on the physiologically plausible mechanism of shunting inhibition with its various systematic connection schemes. The network has a generic architecture in which shunting inhibitory neurons are used as feature extraction elements. A series of training algorithms, ranging from first-order gradient methods to Quasi-Newton and hybrid methods, have been implemented to adapt the synaptic weights of the developed networks; all of them have been successfully used to train the convolutional neural networks for a classification task.To demonstrate their capability in real life applications, the convolutional networks are employed in a face detection system and a handwritten digit recognition system. The face detector has 383 trainable network parameters and achieves a detection rate of 98%for detecting human faces on a large set of unconstrained and complex images. The handwritten digit recognition system, on the other hand, has 2722 trainable parameters, and its classification rate is 97.3% for recognizing human handwritten numerals. Besides these two applications, the developed network is analyzed for its built-in invariance, and it is implemented as a rotation invariant face classifier. The network achieves a classification rate of 97.3% in the rotation range &#177;900, and for 360&#176; in-plane rotation, it has a correct detection rate of 93.6% at 5% false detection rate. These classification results demonstrate that the new class of convolutional neural networks has excellent generalization capability and achieves rotation invariance by adapting its connection weight matrices (receptive fields) as invariant feature detectors.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/540</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sintering, microstructure and properties of WC-FeAl-B and WC-Ni3Al-B composite materials</field><field name="creator">Ahmadian-Najafabadi, Mehdi</field><field name="description">The effect of boron on microstructure and mechanical properties of the intermetallic matrix composites (WC-FeAl-B and WC-Ni3Al-B) were investigated. The results were compared with those obtained from WC-Co composite which had same binder volume fraction and fabricated under identical sintering conditions. Boron doped FeAl (FeooA14o) and NhAl alloys were selected as potential new alternative binders in place of cobalt for WC composites due to their particular combination of mechanical properties.Sub micron WC-40vol%(FeAl-B), WC40vol%(NhAl-B) and WC-4Ovol%Co composites were synthesized by powder processing followed by uniaxial hot-pressing at the optimized temperature of 1500 &#176;C under a pressure of20 MFa in argon atmosphere. Doped aluminide binders, with boron levels ranging from 0 to O.l&#176;W'fOIO, were prepared in ultrafine form using controlled atmosphere arc melting and then ring-grinding under argon atmosphere. Hardness and indentation fracture tests were performed on composite specimens and the microstructures were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Phase and compositional characterization were studied by XRD, TEM-EDS and electron diffraction. Abrasive wear performance was evaluated using a pin-on-drum apparatus and the worn surfaces studied by SEM.The results showed that WC sufficiently wet by the boron doped aluminide binders which resulted in sintered composites with near full densities. WC is also relatively stable in WC-4Ovol%(.FeAI-B) and WC-40vol%(NhAl-B) systems up to 0.1moJO B with no new phases observed at sintering temperature of 1500 "C. The microstructures exhibited faceted WC grains with no significant grain growth, with continuous aluminide binders and similar morphology to WC-Co. Increasing the amount of boron in the aluminide binders up to 0.1 moJO resulted in more faceting in WC particles and increasing amount of dissolved W in the aluminide binders. Furthermore, the WC contiguity (WC/WC contact) and grain sizes of aluminide binders decreased with increasing the amount ofboron in the aluminide binders. Hardness of WC-FeAl was found to be higher than that of WC-NiJAl but the we-co had lowest hardness. WC-FeAl showed the highest wear resistance and lowest fracture toughness compared to those of WC-NiJAl and WC-Co. Fracture toughness and wear resistance of WC-NbAl were found to be comparable to those for WC-Co. Boron addition up to 0.1wtO,Io in both WC-FeAl-B and WC-NhAl-B had no significant effect on the hardness but the boron addition showed significant enhancement in their fracture toughness (42% for WC-FeAl-B and 38% for WC-NhAl-B) and better wear resistance 24% for WC-FeAl-B and 14% for WC-NiJAl-B) which were found to be higher than those of WC-Co. Increasing boron content also resulted in decreasing of surface abrasion during abrasive wear testing by brittle processes such as pull out of particular phases and cracking of carbide particles. The improvement of the fracture toughness and wear resistance with addition of boron could be due to combination of factors including increasing WC solubility in the aluminide binders and reduction in WC contiguity as well as aluminide binder's grain sizes. This in turn could lead to improve the strength of WC/aluminides interfaces and wettability of WC with aluminides.Finally, the boron doped FeAl and NhAl alloys is proposed as alternative binders to replace Co in conventional WC-Co composites and it is envisaged that WC-FeAI-B and WC-Ni3Al-B composites could be considered as potential candidates in some specific applications.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/546</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Structure of properties of the heat affected zone of P91 creep resistant steel</field><field name="creator">Sulaiman, Samsiah</field><field name="description">This investigation is concerned with the characterisation of actual welded samples of P91 - a 9%Cr heat resisting steel that is widely used for pressure vessels in the power generation industry. Although the creep resistance of the normalised and tempered base steel is excellent, weld fabrication compromises creep performance because of degraded properties in the heat affected zone (HAZ). In order to elucidate the structure and properties of the HAZ, dilatometer heat treatments and simulations of HAZ sub-zones were carried out using both a dilatometer and a Gleeble thermo-mechanical simulator. The simulated samples were used to study the microstructure of the HAZ sub-zones and to subject them to creep testing.In actual welding, post weld heat treatment (PWHT) is used to produce a uniform tempered martensite structure across the weldment, making it difficult to distinguish the HAZ sub-zones and the boundary with the unaffected base plate. Nevertheless, hardness profiles across the HAZ and measurements within the sub-zones confirmed that softening occurs below the base plate hardness after PWHT in the intercritical (IC) and grain refined (GR) sub-zones. The creep fracture times of cross-weld creep samples were also lower than parent metal because of type IV fracture in these HAZ sub-zones.Dilatometric investigations shed new light on the sensitivity of the properties of the martensite to the thermal cycle associated with austenitisation and subsequent cooling. The AC1 and AC3 temperatures were increased with increasing heating rate and MS was lower for a lower heating rate. MS was found to vary from 420&#176;C to 370&#176;C and the hardness of the martensite from 365 to 480 HV, depending on the thermal cycle. This varialibilty is due to the extent of carbide solution. There was a marked increase in hardness with increasing peak temperature of the thermal cycle, but subsequent simulated PWHT substantially decreased the hardness and the hardness range of the simulated sub-zones.An excellent correlation was found between the structures and properties of the HAZ of the actual welds and the simulated sub-zones produced by both dilatometric and Gleeble techniques. It was established that the heat input (1.6 or 2.6 kJ/mm) had only a minor effect on the microstructure and hardness of Gleeble simulated sub-zone samples. TEM results confirmed the presence of coarse Cr-rich, M23C6 and fine V-and Nb-rich, MC in all simulated sub-zones, before and after PWHT, except for the as simulated GCHAZ in which carbide solution occurred.Accelerated creep testing showed rapid creep failure of both AR and simulated IC and GR sub-zone samples for testing at higher temperatures in the range of 630&#176;C to 670&#176;C and at a higher stress, 100 MPa compared to 80 MPa. Failure was associated with high creep ductility and the phenomenon of rehardening in the region adjacent to the neck due to rapid work hardening prior to fracture. This type of failure has been labelled Mode 1 and is characterised structurally by grains and creep cavities that are strongly elongated parallel to the tensile axis. Another characteristic type of creep failure, Mode 2, exhibits a low creep ductility and transversely aligned creep cavities. This mode was found in notched AR samples and notched simulated GCHAZ samples tested at 630&#176;C and a stress at 80 MPa. However, for both Mode 1 and 2 failures, non-metallic inclusions were found to play a significant role in the nucleation of creep cracking and cavition. The research work identified that the GRHAZ is the most creep susceptible HAZ sub-zone because the thermal cycle results in carbide coarsening, reduced precipitation and solid solution strengthening and a high &#947; prior grain boundary surface area/unit volume. The creep resistance was most marked for the simulated GCHAZ samples and this property relates strongly to the hardness of the P91 steel prior to creep testing.The important role of non-metallic inclusions in the nucleation of creep cracking and cavitation indicates that control of the type, size distribution and content of inclusions should have a significant effect on the creep life of P91 steel.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/777</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effects of red meat consumption and high-intensity resistance training of skeletal muscle strength, muscle mass and functional status in healthy older adults</field><field name="creator">Gutteridge, Irene Fe</field><field name="description">With the older adult representing an increasingly large percentage of the Western world, attempts are being sought to improve their healthy aging through various modes of prevention. The age-associated declines that occur in the physiological and functional systems along with levels of physical activity and quality of life have the potential to be attenuated and ameliorated with various forms of health-related interventions. It has been suggested that intake of dietary protein in the elderly may be too low to sustain normal muscle mass and red meat intake declines in the over 65 y age group in Australia.The present study examined the effects of a high-intensity resistance training program and two levels of red meat intake on skeletal muscle strength, body composition and other health-related markers in healthy, community-dwelling older adults. Twenty-eight healthy male and female subjects with mean age (&#177;SD) of 67 &#177;3 y and randomized to either a moderate (400g/wk) or high (800g/wk) red meat diet, completed a supervised twice weekly, twelve week high-intensity resistance training program of the lower extremities. The moderate meat diet represented the usual intake for older Australians over 65 y. Diet histories, body composition assessments, mid-thigh CT scans, grip strength, lower extremity performance, physical activity levels, one-mile walk test, fasted blood samples and morning urine samples were taken at baseline and twelve weeks. Four repetition maximum strength testing of the lower extremity was undertaken at pre-, mid- and postintervention.Leg strength was greater in males than in females and this was strongly associated with their muscle mass and stature independent of gender. Age related declines in grip strength and leg muscle strength were evident at baseline. Resistance training significantly increased leg muscle strength &gt;50% (p&lt;0.001) irrespective of gender and age but grip strength (not targeted by the training program) remained unchanged. In subjects on the higher meat diet, mid-intervention leg press strength improvements were greater than those seen with the moderate meat diet (p&lt;0.01), although significant differences between diets were not sustained at week twelve.  The sum of seven skinfolds (mm) decreased significantly in all subjects with training (131.2&#177;8.8 to 119.9&#177;7.3, p&lt;0.001) and significant improvement to the proportion of cross-sectional area of thigh muscle and thigh fat were measured in the non-dominant leg (p&lt;0.05). Physical activity levels and lower extremity performance remained unchanged. The high red meat diet provided additional short-term benefits for building muscle strength without compromising cardiovascular disease risk factors, but in the longer term had no additional beneficial effects to strength and functional parameters.In summary, healthy older adults exhibit an age related decline in strength, yet all have the capacity to greatly increase strength with muscle specific exercise training.  Marked increases in strength can be rapidly achieved with short term high intensity resistance training. Resistance training is well tolerated and can be recommended for improving strength and enhancing other health-related parameters as part of a prevention based healthy aging strategy.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/813</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The experiences of recovery from schizophrenia: development of a definition, model and measure of recovery</field><field name="creator">Andresen, Retta</field><field name="description">The traditional view of schizophrenia as having a deteriorating long-term course and an outcome of permanent disability has been challenged both anecdotally and empirically. Therefore, the consumer movement advocates that rehabilitation services become recovery-orientated. Recovery-oriented and empirically validated services have now become policy internationally. However, the meaning of recovery in a medical or research context is different than the meaning used by consumers. The objectives of this research were, therefore to (a) formulate a consumer-oriented definition of recovery; (b) develop a conceptual model of recovery to guide research and evaluation and inform clinical practice; (c) design a measure of recovery, based on the model, and (d) to seek empirical support for the model of recovery.Study One involved a review of the consumer-oriented literature on the concept of recovery, with four aims: (a) to understand the meaning of recovery used by consumers; (b) to identify the components of recovery; (c) to formulate a definition of recovery; and (d) to define the stages of recovery. An examination of consumers&#8217; experiential accounts produced a definition of psychological recovery from the consequences of the illness. Four key processes were identified: (i) finding hope; (ii) re-establishment of identity; (iii) finding meaning in life; and (iv) taking responsibility for wellness and life generally. Five stages were synthesized from the extant qualitative research: (i) moratorium; (ii) awareness; (iii) preparation; (iv) rebuilding and (v) growth. A model of four processes developing over five stages is discussed in the light of the wider literature surrounding recovery from loss and the positive psychology literature. It is concluded that the philosophies of the positive psychology movement have much to offer in recovery-oriented approaches to treatment and research.In Study Two, a brief measure, the Self-identified stage of recovery (SISR), was designed in order to test the model. The aims were to (a) test the validity of the stage measure against continuous recovery measures; (b) to test the notion of recovery assessment as opposed to conventional measures of outcome, and (c) to seek support for the stage model of recovery. The SISR was completed by a clinical population participating in a larger study. High correlations between the recovery measures (rs = .262, p = .01 to rs = .712, p = .01) supported the validity of the SISR, while the pattern of correlations between the recovery measure subscales supported the validity of the SISR as a measure of level of recovery.  Negative to low correlations between recovery and conventional measures (rs = - .375 to rs = .191) supported the divergent validity of recovery as an outcome as distinct from conventional measures. In addition, an effect of stage was found on one conventional measure (F (4,127) = 2.9, p &lt; .05) and all recovery measures (F (4, 141) = 2.87, p&lt;.05) to F (4, 141) = 4.68 (p &lt;.001), lending support to the stage model of recovery.The aims of Study Three were to (a) produce a longer, more reliable measure that would better capture the richness of the experience of recovery; (b) examine the validity and reliability of this measure; and (c) seek further support for the stage model of recovery. The Stages of Recovery Instrument (STORI) consists of 50 items, each representing a psychological process at a stage of recovery. The STORI yields five stage subscale scores.  A postal survey of volunteers revealed that the STORI correlated with six psychological health variables (rs= 0.45 (p &lt; .01) to rs = 0 .62 (p &lt; .01). Correlational analysis provided support for an ordinal relationship between the stage subscales. An effect of stage was found on all recovery-related variables, (F (3,110) =10.70 (p &lt;.01) to F (3,111) = 24.44 (p &lt; .01). However, a cluster analysis of items resulted in three subscale clusters, rather than the expected five, revealing an overlap between adjacent stages.The results provide preliminary empirical validation of the STORI as a measure of the consumer definition of recovery. Although an effect of stage was found, refinement of the measure is needed to improve its capacity to discriminate between the stages. It could then be used in comprehensively testing the stage model using longitudinal methods and the inclusion of objective measures. The concept of recovery elucidated in this research underlines the importance of taking a positive stance to recovery, focusing on values, meaning and growth rather than on illness-focused approaches to care. The five-stage model has proven useful in clinical training and as a framework for research into recovery. Validation of the model with longitudinal research is planned. Further development of the STORI is underway in separate research, and when refined, the measure should provide an outcome assessment tool that is meaningful to consumers and a useful adjunct to conventional clinical measurement.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/814</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fabrication and characterization of superconducting  PLD MgB2 thin films</field><field name="creator">Zhao, Yue</field><field name="description">The aim of this thesis was to study the thin film of magnesium diboride (MgB2) superconductor based on PLD synthesis technique. The MgB2 is a very simple binary compound with a number of surprising properties. The discovery of superconductivity with a critical temperature (Tc) of 39 K in bulk MgB2 in January 2001 has attracted a huge research interests worldwide in this material. In a hope to substitute MgB2 superconducting electronics for low temperature superconducting electronics and compete with high temperature superconductors, the preparation techniques of MgB2 thin films need to be advanced from a material engineering point of view. On the other hand, new studies regarding the different behaviours of MgB2 thin films and MgB2 bulks will assist the scientific community to better understand the physics in this superconductor.We began the study with in situ MgB2 film preparation using normal on-axis geometry. The in situ annealing conditions of pulsed laser deposited MgB2 films were studied. We found that the superconducting properties depend in a crucial way on the annealing conditions: temperature, heating rate and time. We tested the Tc dependence of the in situ annealed MgB2 films by changing various process parameters, including laser energy density, target-substrate distance, background gas, annealing temperatures, heating rates and dwell times. The film processing conditions were optimized and good quality in situ films were obtained routinely, with good reproducibility. The hysteresis loops of magnetic moment versus applied field at different temperatures indicate a weak field dependence in high fields. Magnetooptical imaging of the films showed quite homogeneous magnetic flux penetration, indicating structural homogeneity. The films without annealing show no superconductivity.Another method using ex situ annealing has also been tested for a better crystallization of the MgB2 film, as well as for reference purposes. In the ex situ annealing process, we first deposited boron precursor film on a sapphire substrate and then wrapped it in Ta foil and sealed it in a stainless steel tube together with pure Mg pellets, under protective Ar atmosphere. The tube was then annealed in tube furnace and kept at 900&#186;C for 30 min. With this method, we obtained ex-situ MgB2 films of comparable quality as those reported so far in the literature, and used them as a benchmark to test possible improvements in MgB2 thin film technology based on PLD.  Significant differences in properties between the in situ films and ex situ films were found. The ex situ annealed MgB2 film has a Tc onset of 38.1K, while the in situ film has a suppressed Tc onset of 34.5K. The resistivity at 40K for the in situ film is larger than that of the ex situ film by a factor of 6. The residual resistivity ratios are 1.1 and 2.1 for the in situ and ex situ films respectively. The field dependence of the resistivity-temperature curves has been measured. A large slope of the Hc2-T curve was obtained for the in situ annealed film. The Jc-H curves of the in situ film show a much weaker field dependence than those of the ex situ film, attributable to stronger flux pinning in the in situ film. The microstructural differences between the two types of films are observed by AFM and TEM. The small-grain (&lt;60nm) size and a high oxygen level detected in the in situ annealed MgB2 films may be decisive for the significant improvement of Jc and Hc2. In order to enhance the performance of the MgB2 films, various amounts of Si up to a level of 18wt% were added into MgB2 thin films fabricated by pulsed laser deposition. Si was introduced into the PLD MgB2 films by sequential ablation of a stoichiometric MgB2 target and a Si target. The Tc's of the Si added MgB2 thin films were tested. A Jc enhancement was observed in the Si added MgB2 films. For the ~3.5wt% Si addition, the best enhancement circumstance, the magnetic critical current density (Jc) of the film at 5K was increased by 50% as compared to the undoped film.The slope of Hirr(T) and Hc2(T) curves of the 3.5wt% Si added MgB2 film was slightly higher than that for the undoped film. For the application in superconducting electronics, the surface smoothness of the MgB2 thin film is of crucial importance. We pioneered an off-axis deposition geometry in the PLD MgB2 films preparation. Highly smooth and c-axis oriented superconducting MgB2 thin films were successfully achieved with a off-axis geometry. The films were deposited on Al2O3-C substrates, aligned perpendicular to a stoichiometric MgB2 target in a 120 mTorr high purity Ar background gas. An in situ annealing was carried out at 650&#8451; for 1 min in a 760 Torr Ar atmosphere. Despite the short annealing time, an x-ray _-2_ scan shows fairly good crystallization, according to the clear c-axis oriented peaks for the films. Both atomic force microscopy and the x-ray diffraction results indicated that the crystallite size is less than 50nm. The root mean square roughness of our off-axis film was ~4 nm in a 5&#61655;5 &#956;m2 area. The zero resistance Tc value of the best off-axis film reached 32.2 K with a narrow transition width of 0.9 K. The films showed no anisotropy in Hc2-T curves when parallel and perpendicular fields were applied relative to the film surface. The slope of Hc2-T curves is ~1 T/K, which is still among the highest reported values. On the basis of successful preparation of smooth off-axis MgB2 films, we obtained MgB2/Mg2Si multilayer structure by sequentially switching a stoichiometric MgB2 target and a Si target during off-axis pulsed-laser deposition. The transmission electron microscope cross-sectional image of the resulting film exhibits a layered structure with each MgB2 layer being 40-50 nm thick and the Mg2Si inter-layers about 5 nm thick. A clear enhanced anisotropy in the irreversibility lines and the vortex activation energy was observed. Pinning and the flux flow activation energy for this type of film was significantly increased in parallel applied fields.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/816</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">SATELLITE HAEMODIALYSIS NURSES&#146; PERCEPTIONS OF QUALITY NURSING CARE: A CRITICAL ETHNOGRAPHY</field><field name="creator">Bennett, Paul Norman</field><field name="description">People living with end stage kidney disease require dialysis or kidney transplantation to maintain life. Of those receiving dialysis in Australia, most people receive this treatment in satellite haemodialysis centres that are nurse-run, community-based clinics. Nurses provide the majority of care in these clinics with little or no on-site medical support, yet there has been minimal research exploring nursing care, or perceptions of nurses, in the satellite haemodialysis context. The major aim of this study was to explore satellite dialysis nurses&#146; perceptions of quality care. Fundamental to this aim was the premise that to improve nursing care, nurses need to understand the factors influencing satellite dialysis nursing care. 
A critical ethnography exploring the culture of one satellite haemodialysis clinic, focusing on the nurse&#146;s perception of quality was undertaken, with a focus on issues of power that influenced satellite dialysis nursing care. Over a period of twelve months, interviews with nurses, non-participant observation and document analysis were conducted. Of particular concern was the satellite dialysis nurses&#146; struggle with the dominant medical discourse of quantitative measurement of quality. Bourdieu&#146;s notions of habitus, field and practice provided a vehicle to explore nurses&#146; dispositions that operated within the institutional conditions of the medicalised discourse and physical structure of the satellite dialysis environment. 
Findings about nurses&#146; perceptions of quality dialysis care were categorised into three broad themes: what is quality; what is not quality; and what affects quality. Nurses considered technical knowledge, technical skills and personal respect as characteristics of quality. Long-term blood pressure management and arranging transport for people receiving dialysis treatment were not seen to be quality priorities. The person receiving dialysis treatment, management, nurse and environment were considered major factors influencing and determining quality dialysis nursing care. Acceptance by nurses about their position and their reluctance to challenge medical power was revealed. 
Aspects of power and oppression operated for nurses and people receiving dialysis treatment within the satellite dialysis context, and this environment was perceived by the nurses as very different from hospital dialysis units. Bourdieu&#146;s notions of habitus and subconscious reproduced practices were embedded in the satellite dialysis nurses&#146; behaviour and were conveyed to other nurses. In order to improve nursing care in this context, ten recommendations were proposed: 1) implementing a concordance nursing care model; 2) using a goal-setting framework; 3) increasing staff rotation between dialysis units; 4) improving satellite dialysis unit design; 
5) educating satellite dialysis nurses in internet and database skills; 6) using new technologies in staff education programmes; 7) recognising increased patient acuity; 8) research exploring residential dialysis facilities; 9) introducing advanced practice nurses in a satellite collaborative model of care; and 10) requiring a structured programme of reflective practice. 
Facilitating change in dialysis nursing practice was fundamental to this study and consistent with a critical approach. New understandings for the nurses may not result in practice change however, unless there is a collective review and uptake of these practices. This study offers new knowledge about quality nursing in satellite haemodialysis units, enabling nurses to critically reflect on, and improve, the quality of care they provide.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">dialysis</field><field name="subject">nursing</field><field name="subject">ethnography</field><field name="subject">renal</field><field name="subject">technology</field><field name="subject">quality</field><field name="identifier">http://catalogue.flinders.edu.au./local/adt/public/adt-SFU20090828.154836</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Growing Up Catholic in Sunshine, 1919-1927, The Establishment of Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception Primary School: A journey in historiography</field><field name="creator">Lane, Maureen</field><field name="description">This study is, in effect, the compilation and the telling of the story of the establishment of the school of Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception at Sunshine, it seeks to add to the quantum of knowledge available in regard to: First - the story of that particular school's establishment, Second - its derivation from and contribution to the \vider context of the development of Catholic education in Victoria, and Third - its place in the story of the growth of a suburban community as a reflection of some of the social forces which were operating in Victoria at that time.

KDO is an essential component in the cell wall of Gram-negative bacteria and plants. This compound is not present in mammals; therefore the enzymes responsible for its biosynthesis are potential targets for the development of new antibiotic agents. KDO8P synthase catalyzes the condensation reaction between phosphoenol pyruvate (PEP) and D-arabinose 5-phosphate (A5P) to form KDO8P. Two types of KDO8P synthase have been identified; a metal-dependent type and a non metal-dependent type. KDO8P synthase from the organism Chlorobium tepidum (Cte) has been partially purified and partially characterized. In line with predictions based on sequence alone, the activity of this enzyme is dependent on the presence of a divalent metal ion and is sensitive to the presence of the metal chelating agent EDTA. Cte KDO8P synthase was found to have the highest activity in the presence of Mn2+ or Cd2+. KDO8P synthase from the organism Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans (Afe) has also been cloned, purified and biochemically characterized. Afe KDO8P synthase was also found to be a metallo enzyme and the catalytic activity is highest in the presence of Mn2+ or Co2+. Afe KDO8P synthase was found to exist as a tetramer in solution and is most active within the pH range of 6.8 to 7.5 and within a temperature range of 35 &#186;C to 40 &#186;C. Sequence analysis suggests that this enzyme has characteristics conserved throughout the metallo and the non-metallo KDO8P synthases and is closely related to the metal-dependent 3-deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonate 7-phosphate (DAH7P) synthases. The role of several active-site residues of Afe KDO8P synthase has been investigated. A C21N mutant of Afe KDO8P synthase was found to retain 0.5% of wildtype activity and did not require a divalent metal ion for catalytic activity. This suggests that the metallo and non-metallo KDO8P synthases have similar catalytic mechanisms.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">microbial enzymes</field><field name="subject">gram-negative bacteria</field><field name="subject">cytochemistry</field><field name="subject">hydrolases</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270100 Biochemistry and Cell Biology::270108 Enzymes</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/706</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Decision-making in a corporate boardroom: Inside the black box</field><field name="creator">Martyn, Karen</field><field name="description">The lack of empirical studies on board process represents a serious knowledge gap in the governance literature.  To date there has been little research on how boards actually make decisions, the factors that contribute to effective board decision-making, and what tools and techniques may be used to improve board decision-making.  Effective board processes are identified as leading to effective board outputs, and subsequently more effective organisational outcomes.  This study explored the internal factors under the control of the board (or those selecting board members) that contribute to effective board decision-making processes.  The perspective of small group decision-making research was applied to explore board decision-making processes.  The three aims of the study were to investigate those factors that directors thought contributed to their board's successful and unsuccessful decision-making, to observe how a board actually makes decisions; and to determine whether training and usage of a normative decision-making methodology (including the use of a reminder role) might improve that board's decision-making process. Data collection included direct, in situ, observation of a board; semi-structured interviews with all board directors, the CEO and four executive team members; three surveys; and emotional intelligence testing (MSCEIT).  The board was found to use normative decision-making procedures.  These decision making procedures appeared to contribute to better decision-making processes and consequently better decision-making outputs.  The task intent of acting in the best interest of the company and the relationship intent of trust were found to permeate the board inputs and processes examined during this research.  Other input and process variables observed to influence board decision-making were classified as being task (structure, process, communication) and/or relational (relationships, director attributes and emotions) factors.  Task factors included rational decision-making procedures; clarity of goals and roles; use of external advisors as critical evaluators; quantity and quality of information; consensus decision-making; post-decision evaluation and learning.  Relational factors included homogeneity of directors through careful selection; socialising with management; board norms of a safe environment, supporting the doubtful director and the obligation to share contrary views; adequate business knowledge; emotional intelligence; and commitment.  The results of emotional intelligence testing revealed levels sufficient to assist in positive board dynamics.  The study results support the application of small group decision making research to aid in board process research, and further empirical exploration of board inputs using psychometric measures.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Decision making</field><field name="subject">Boards of directors</field><field name="subject">Corporate governance</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350200 Business and Management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/986</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The evolving role of the environmental health officer: maintaining public health in the context of a changing food regulatory environment</field><field name="creator">Grigonis-Deane, Elizabeth</field><field name="description">This qualitative study aimed to describe how environmental health officers prioritized different components of food regulation enforcement within the context of their overall workload, to gather information about how to better prepare environmental health officers for the demands of their role.  A significant change in the role of environmental health officers is occurring due to new legislative requirements related to food labelling. In 2003, the Australia and New Zealand Food Regulation Ministerial Council (the Ministerial Council) developed a Policy Guideline on Nutrition, Health and Related Claims (the Policy Guideline), providing a framework for the regulation of nutrition, health and related claims.   Environmental health officers are likely to be responsible for the enforcement of these proposed new regulations.  The proposed monitoring role is as yet untested and the factors influencing the environmental health officers&#8217; decisions about prioritization of work load are unknown.  The priority given to the enforcement of such regulations may impact on how effectively environmental health officers perform this aspect of their work load.   The data used in this study were obtained through semi-structured interviews with 37 environmental health officers from three states, NSW, QLD and ACT.  The sample included male and female officers at both field and senior level across local and state sites.  The interview transcripts were analyzed by thematic coding with the aid of a qualitative software analysis package.   The work and control scales survey data were analyzed using SPSS 15. Results showed that field officers considered themselves to be protectors of the community&#8217;s health, closely interacting with the community and responding to their demands and complaints.  Field officers&#8217; routine inspections and investigation of food poisoning and hygiene complaints were given highest priority, while monitoring health claims on food labels was given low priority.  Conversely, senior officers reported being more involved with management, interacting with outside organizations and politics, and assigned higher priority to the monitoring of health claims on food labels.The analysis of environmental health officers&#8217; work practices and attitudes using the framework of Lipsky&#8217;s (1980) theory of street-level-bureaucracy was used to enhance present understanding of the implications for policy implementation at the interface between the public and government. This study extends existing knowledge about the motivations behind the work practice of environmental health officers, a poorly researched group, and explores their roles within Lipsky&#8217;s framework of street-level bureaucrats.  The study thus extends Lipsky&#8217;s model into a new area of work practice.  Contrary to previous studies indicating street-level bureaucrats use coping mechanisms to decrease frustration caused by work conditions, this study&#8217;s results revealed that the desire to create positive outcomes for the community drove the behaviour of environmental health officers.   Further results from this study indicate that environmental health officers, through their work practices and especially in their enforcement role, have the capacity to optimize or lessen the benefits to consumers of food regulations such as nutrition and health related claims on food labels.   Three major recommendations arise out of this study to ensure that consumers benefit from the new legislation regarding nutrition and health related claims on food labels.  There should be provision of sufficient resources and timely training in new responsibilities for environmental health officers.  Communication between State and local government authorities must continue to be improved and maintained, so that adequate support and appropriate guidance from team leaders is consistently available.  Lastly, increased public education regarding the importance of nutrition, health and related claims as a tool to make healthier food purchases is needed.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/817</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigation of the factors influencing the wettability of conducting polymers for fluid control in microfluidic devices</field><field name="creator">Halldorsson, Jenny</field><field name="description">The advent of miniaturised analytical systems has the potential to revolutionise the way in which chemical and biological analyses are made, due to the benefits of reduced reagent consumption, increased sensitivity and decreased analysis times.  With increasingly smaller device dimensions comes the need for more efficient methods of controlling fluid flow on the microscale.  Electrokinetic techniques, such as electrophoresis and electroosmosis, are well suited for delivering analytes and reagents in microfluidic devices, however high driving voltages and power requirements limit the size to which the device may be miniaturised and thus limit the applicability of these flow control methods for portable, hand-held devices.  In order to overcome this limitation, an elegant use of surface tension forces which dominate at the microscale is necessary.Conducting organic polymers, such as polythiophene and polypyrrole, have found widespread use in recent years due to their attractive mechanical properties and processability, in addition to their ability to be reversibly switched between oxidised (conducting) and reduced (insulating) forms.  This redox switching may be accompanied by a change in polymer properties such as wettability and surface energy which may be altered dramatically upon external stimulation, commonly in the form of a small applied electrical potential.The effect of redox switching upon conducting polymer wettability for fluid control in microfluidic devices is the central theme which was explored in this thesis. In particular, the aims of this thesis were to characterise the wettability of conducting polymers and investigate the factors which influence it, as well as explore the use of conducting polymers for fluid control in simple, dynamically controlled microfluidic devices, based on the change in wetting properties upon in&#172;-situ electrochemical redox switching.  The role of polymer oxidation state, film thickness, polymerisation substrate and the configuration of the electrochemical cell used for fluid control were considered.  Goniometry and tensiometry were used to characterise polymer wetting properties, while microscopy techniques (scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy and optical profilometry) were used to probe the morphology of polymer and understand the role of roughness on conducting polymer wettability and fluid movement.  The electrochemical properties of polymers were characterised by cyclic voltammetry, while Raman spectroscopy was employed to gain insight into the role of water and film thickness in determining the oxidation state of polyterthiophene in Chapter 3.The insights gained during polymer wettability characterisations were extended to investigate surface tension-induced fluidic control using electrochemical cells in both channel-based and droplet-based configurations upon the application of a small voltage. The knowledge gained during the course of this study should form the basis for developing devices which will contribute to interesting solutions for improving flow control on the microscale.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/31</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterization of the performance of the new MOSkin dosimeter as a quality assurance tool for pulsed dose-rate (PDR) prostate brachytherapy, and the effect of rectal heterogeneity on the dose delivered to the rectal wall</field><field name="creator">Kwan, Ian S</field><field name="description">Brachytherapy is a common treatment modality used for treating prostate cancer. The radiation is emitted from within the prostate, which focuses the damage on the tumour rather than the surrounding healthy tissue. However, due to the close proximity of the rectum to the prostate, there is a possibility that the rectum will receive too much radiation dose during prostate treatment. This may lead to post-treatment rectal complications that range in severity from general rectal discomfort and bleeding, to the development of a rectal fistula that may require surgical intervention. Currently, there is no real-time quality assurance tool used to verify that the rectum does not receive too much radiation dose.The Centre for Medical Radiation Physics (CMRP) at the University of Wollongong, Australia, has developed a new MOSFET dosimeter called the MOSkin with a unique packaging design that should demonstrate some benefits over other MOSFET dosimeters. The MOSkin can potentially serve as a real-time rectal dosimeter for use during a PDR or HDR brachytherapy treatment.The general aim of this research is to characterise the performance of the new MOSkin dosimeter, and to determine whether the unique design of the MOSkin demonstrates dosimetric advantages over other dosimeters for brachytherapy, and in certain other applications. The performance characteristics of the MOSkin were explored by exposing it to a 6 MV x-ray field delivered by a linear accelerator (LINAC), and also with an Ir-192 PDR brachytherapy source.The MOSkin was irradiated with a 6 MV, 1010 cm3 photon beam with the gantry set to 100 cm source-to-surface distance, and its dose response was compared to the response of a CC13 compact ionization chamber, and a couple of fiber optic dosimeters.The fiber optic dosimeters had either a 0.5 or 1 mm diameter scintillating crystal attached to one end of the optical fiber. The MOSkin&#8217;s ability to measure the skin dose to a depth of 0.07 mm, which corresponds to the nominal depth of the basal cell layer of the epidermis, was compared to Attix chamber and fiber optic dosimeter measurements, along with skin dose measurements reported in other studies found in the literature. My research was primarily concerned with dosimetry at shallow depths in the phantom because it was believed that the MOSkin&#8217;s packaging design would prove advantageous over other dosimeters at such depths.With regards to brachytherapy, the dose response of the MOSkin was compared to the response of a RADFET dosimeter within a rectal phantom. Brachytherapy treatment planning systems (TPS) calculate the dose by assuming that the human body is a large, homogeneous water-equivalent material. The effect that a hollow, air-filled rectal cavity has on the anterior rectal dose was investigated by measuring the dose delivered to the inner wall of a rectal phantom while it was empty, and comparing dose measurement to the dose measured within a homogeneous rectal phantom, and the dose calculated by the TPS. The results were also corroborated by Monte Carlo simulations written with the Geant4 toolkit.The results of an early stage, Phase II clinical trial at St. George Cancer Care Centre are discussed. The MOSkin was used to measure the dose delivered to the anterior wall of the patient&#8217;s rectum during PDR brachytherapy patients during treatment, and the results are compared to the dose calculated by the TPS. The results were also compared to the observations made during the phantom study.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/818</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies on the growth and compositional development of antlers in red deer (Cervus elaphus)</field><field name="creator">Muir, Paul David</field><field name="description">The experiments described in this thesis investigated nutritional and physiological aspects of antler growth in red deer stags. The initial experiment (Section 3) examined the effects of winter nutrition on subsequent antler casting date and velvet antler weight. Mature stags on two different farm types (hill country, Farm H and irrigated lowland, Farm L) were offered three levels of winter nutrition, two levels of a concentrate supplement (ad libitum pellets and 1/2 ad libitum pellets) and a basal hay ration. On both properties liveweight gains occurred in supplemented groups and liveweight losses in unsupplemented groups. At antler casting there were significant differences in liveweight of approximately 10 kg between fully supplemented and unsupplemented groups. Realimentation of winter liveweight losses subsequently occurred so that by the following rut the effects of winter undernutrition had been eliminated. On Farm H poor winter nutrition (hay only) resulted in a significant delay in casting date (13 days) and lower velvet antler yields (0.24 kg), than in stags offered the ad libitum concentrate ration. Stags on Farm H were 13 kg lighter at commencement of the trial than at Farm L and the differences in treatment effects obtained between farms may have been due to differences in body condition at commencement of the trial. An association was demonstrated between liveweight and date of antler casting, with heavier stags casting earlier than lighter stags. There was no effect of age of stag on casting date. Of the liveweights recorded, liveweight prior to the rut showed the best relationship with casting date, possibly because the seasonal nature of liveweight change meant that a weight recorded at this time gave the best indicator of the true frame size of a stag. Both age and liveweight significantly affected velvet antler weight, with increases of velvet antler weight of 0.26 kg between 3 and 4-year-old stags and of 0.30 kg between 4 and 5-year-old stags at the same liveweight. Within an age group velvet weight increased by 0.12 kg for each 10 kg increase in pre-rut liveweight. The experiments described in Section 4 comprised studies on antler growth and composition. In order to obtain data on antler growth and composition individual antlers were removed sequentially from mature red deer stags between 28 and 112 days after casting of hard antlers. Contralateral antlers were removed after stripping of velvet. Wide variation occurred in antler casting date (53 days) compared to date of velvet stripping (24 days). The duration of the period of antler growth may therefore be governed more by date of casting than by date of velvet stripping. Mean duration of the antler growth period was 164 days. Growth in length of the antler appeared to follow a sigmoid curve. However, between 28 and 112 days after casting, rates of elongation were close to linear. Mean length of hard stripped antlers was 0.71 m and between 28 to 112 days after casting mean rate of antler elongation was 0.62 cm/day. Over this period indivdual antlers increased in fresh weight at a rate of 13.7 g/d, with heaviest weight recorded 112 days after antler casting, at approximately 130% of final hard antler weight. Between 28 and 91 days of growth, volume of blood in the antler increased linearly at a rate of 194 ml/kg. Three phases of mineralization were demonstrated in developing antlers. Tips of growing antlers were cartilaginous and poorly mineralized. A zone of mineralization occurred 5.0 to 7.5 cm behind the antler tip which corresponded histologically to the transition from mineralized cartilage to trabecular bone. The second phase of mineralization occurred through continued accretion of trabecular bone in the antler shaft. The third phase, described as "terminal mineralization" in this study, appeared to be associated with a rapid increase in density of cortical bone in the periphery of the antler shaft. Terminal mineralization (between 91 and 112 days after casting of hard antlers) coincided with the slowing of growth in length, a decrease in relative blood volume in the antler and an increase in levels of plasma testosterone. These events occurred close to the summer solstice. At velvet stripping individual antlers had a mean weight of 1.12 kg and contained 81.1% dry matter (DM). Fat free organic matter (FFOM) and ash concentration in DM were 36.6 and 60.0%, respectively. Peak daily rates of FFOM and ash deposition occurred between 91 days and 112 days after casting, at rates of 1.4% of hard antler FFOM and 1.6% of hard antler ash. For a stag producing 2.24 kg of hard antler mean rates of FFOM and ash deposition over this period were 9.3 and 18.3 g/d, respectively. On a whole antler basis calcium concentration in antler ash remained constant, at around 35%. Therefore peak rate of antler calcium deposition would be 6.4 g/d. In the final experiment (Section 5) mature stags were offered a maintenance ration of greenfeed oats during the period of peak calcium requirement for antler growth and the kinetics of calcium metabolism were examined using a radio-isotope (&#8308;&#8309;Ca). Rates of faecal endogenous loss were low and at approximately 6.4 mg/kg BW per were half the estimated requirements of ARC (1980) for sheep and cattle. Availability of calcium from greenfeed oats was low (mean, 37%) and less than 30% of total calcium requirements were derived from the diet. Poorly mineralized skeletal bones indicated that the shortfall in antler calcium was derived from the skeleton. In spite of a severely negative calcium balance stags were capable of maintaining high and apparently normal rates of antler calcium deposition (mean, 44 mg/kg BW per day). Antlers appear to be acting as a sink with calcium being irreversibly deposited in the antler and lost to the animal's body. On the assumption therefore that antler calcium behaves like calcium lost during lactation a kinetic model of calcium metabolism in the stag was developed.</field><field name="date">1985</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">red deer</field><field name="subject">Cervus elaphus</field><field name="subject">antlers</field><field name="subject">nutrition</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300400 Animal Production::300403 Animal nutrition</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300400 Animal Production</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/1178</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sustainable area planning framework for ecologically sustainable development</field><field name="creator">Rauscher, Raymond</field><field name="description">Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD)</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">urban planning</field><field name="subject">sustainable development</field><field name="subject">planning frameworks</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1959.13/38413</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigating student outcomes from a service learning project</field><field name="creator">Gibson, Shona</field><field name="description">The purpose of this study was to investigate the outcomes of a group of 15 and 16 year old school students who participated in a service learning project, referred to as the &#8216;Adopt a School&#8217; project. This study was undertaken to understand what effect the project had on these students, and how it impacted on them as people. This study focused on the experiences these students had during their field trip in Sri Lanka in September 2005. A qualitative methodology incorporating the grounded theory was selected to analyse the data.The study identified that service learning engagement provides powerful and deep learning experiences which encourage students to reflect on their beliefs, attitudes and relationships with others, especially on their life as teenagers in Australia and, as a result, what they had come to take for granted or have not questioned.A core finding from this study was that service learning involvement promoted identity formation. Immersion in the host community facilitated new and more complex thinking about their personal and social identities, the construction of identity in relation to serving others, and the kinds of commitments participants wanted to make in their lives. Because students were introduced to and developed relationships with, individuals and experiences with which they were unfamiliar, previously held notions of self and other were challenged, and reconstructed. Implications for education have been drawn from the results of this study.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/820</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Behavioural and chemical changes induced by early brain development interruption from PCP : implications for schizophrenia</field><field name="creator">du Bois, Teresa</field><field name="description">Schizophrenia is a disorder which continues to intrigue scientists in regards to its complex pathological mechanisms underlying the range of symptoms suffered by patients. Current treatments for the disorder do not provide complete relief or cure for symptoms. Evidence suggests schizophrenia has its origins in early brain development, although the onset of psychosis is not until late adolescence/early adulthood. Hypofunction of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors has also been strongly implicated in the disorder since NMDA receptor antagonists like phencyclidine (PCP) and ketamine elicit a schizophrenia-like psychosis in healthy individuals, and worsen symptoms in schizophrenia patients. Perinatal PCP treatment in rats is therefore potentially a very good developmental animal model for studying pathological processes which may be involved in schizophrenia, and findings from this model may aid in the development of effective treatments for the disorder.This study aimed to determine if early brain developmental disruption from PCP alters the developmental expression of key neurotransmitter receptors involved in schizophrenia. This was achieved by examining NMDA, GABA and M1/4 receptor binding levels in rats at several time-points (1 day, 1 week, 3 weeks and 10 weeks) following PCP treatment (10mg/kg, s.c) on postnatal days 7, 9 and 11. Locomotor activity, social interaction as well as anxiety and depression-like behaviours were also tested in the same animals at adulthood. The effects of adult PCP treatment on NMDA, GABAA, muscarinic M1/4, dopamine D2 receptor and dopamine transporter (DAT) binding levels were also examined. In addition, the effects of perinatal and adult PCP treatment on dopamine receptor function was assessed in a [35S]guanosine 5'-O-&#947;-(thiotriphosphate) ([35S]GTP&#947;S) binding assay.Perinatal PCP treatment increased NMDA and GABAA receptor binding density in the thalamus and hippocampus compared to controls, an effect which lasted until adulthood. The prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortices also showed increased binding levels of these two receptors, mainly at adolescence. M1/4 receptor binding density was reduced in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus one day after perinatal PCP treatment, and increased in the prefrontal cortex at adolescent and adult ages. Perinatal PCP treatment increased locomotor activity, but did not alter social interaction, anxiety-like or depression-like behaviours. Adult PCP treatment produced only minor changes in those same neurotransmitter receptors mentioned above, although this treatment increased D2 receptor binding density in the caudate putamen and nucleus accumbens, and increased DAT binding density in the ventral tegmental area and caudate putamen. Neither perinatal nor adult PCP treatment altered the function of dopamine receptors.This study has shown that perinatal PCP treatment alters the expression of several neurotransmitter receptors in many brain regions and affects behaviour long after treatment cessation. Disinhibition of pyramidal neurons from reduced GABAergic output may be a pathological mechanism underlying behavioural effects seen after perinatal PCP treatment. In contrast, the same dose of PCP given to adult rats produced only minor changes in receptor binding density in few brain regions. Therefore, disrupting brain development at an early stage can have long-lasting consequences which are relevant to the study of psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, which is thought be a neurodevelopmental disorder, involving NMDA receptor hypofunction.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/819</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Power and pragmatism in the political economy of Angkor</field><field name="creator">Lustig, Eileen Joan</field><field name="description">Doctor of Philosophy</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Angkor</field><field name="subject">Khmer inscriptions</field><field name="subject">political economy</field><field name="subject">Pre Angkor</field><field name="subject">empires</field><field name="subject">monetisation</field><field name="subject">cycles</field><field name="subject">imperial strategies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/5356</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Russian Orthodox Music in Australia: The translation of a tradition</field><field name="creator">Maximova, Galina</field><field name="description">For over 50 years the presence of Russian people has been significant in Australia and the Russian Orthodox Church has been established in 24 centers in all states and territories. The richness of the musical heritage of the Russian Orthodox Church is well known; it has a tradition extending over many centuries and one which embraces an enormous repertoire of various styles of chant together with a vast repertoire of polyphonic music, much of it by famous composers. At this point in time there has been virtually no documentation of the history and practice of Russian Orthodox liturgical music in Australia. There are three histories of the Russian church in Australia (Protopopov 1997, 1998, 1999) but the topic of music is not addressed. This is also true of Galina Zakrjevsky's history of St Nicholas Russian Orthodox Cathedral (1998). Studies of Russian immigration to this country include the dissertation by Maria Frolova (1996) and the book by Elena Govor (1997). While liturgical music is not a concern of these writers, their studies nevertheless provide useful background material for an investigation into Russian Orthodox Liturgical music as practised in this country. There are of course numerous studies of Russian church music, notably by Gardner (1980) and Morosan (1991). Their focus is understandably Russian and these books are essential for any understanding of the Australian experience of such liturgical music. This study thus seeks to document the practice of Russian Orthodox liturgical music in Australia from 1926 to 1999. The central research questions are: What is and has been the makeup of Russian Orthodox church choirs in Australia? What is the repertoire of these choirs? What training is available for choristers? To what extent have Australian choirs been able to maintain the traditions of Russian Orthodox liturgical music? What changes have taken place in performance traditions during the time of settlement? In order to achieve these aims there has been a heavy reliance on surveys by means of a questionnaire and interviews with choirmasters, choristers and clergy in five states. Extensive use has been made of archival sources and church magazines such as Word of the Church and Australiada: A Russian Chronicle. Material for a background study of Russian Orthodox music has been drawn from Secondary sources such as Gardner, Morosan, Brill, and Rasumovsky and for a background history of Russian Orthodox church in history of the Russian Orthodox church in Australia from 'A short history of the first Russian Orthodox parish in Sydney' by Soovoroff. For the discussion in Part 2: The Australian Scene special consideration has been given to four choirs: SS Peter &amp; Paul's Cathedral (Sydney), St Nicholas Cathedral (Brisbane), St Nicholas Church (Adelaide), Holy Dormition Church (Dandenong), Holy Virgin Protection Cathedral (Melbourne), the reason being that these represent the different levels of choral standards in this country. Thus these embrace one choir of a large cathedral church, one of a moderately sized cathedral church, one of a very small cathedral church and one of a tiny parish church. The approach adopted involves an examination of the makeup of these selected choirs throughout the time frame of the study. This is followed by an analysis ofthe their repertoire, based on repertoire lists supplied by choir directors. Due to the paucity of source material and fading memories of informants, it has often been impossible to identify key persons by their name: only the surname and initial can be given.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Russian Orthodox Church</field><field name="subject">Church music</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp217.04092009</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Flannery O'Connor's Letters and Fiction: A corresponding identity</field><field name="creator">Rosbrook, Bernadette</field><field name="description">This thesis attempts to demonstrate the way in which Flannery 0' Connor uses the personal letter as vehicle for negotiating her involvement with the world.

A preliminary survey with open-ended questions was used to obtain general opinion on the nature of the school's culture, how it is communicated and the role of the school's organisation structure in communicating the school's culture. From the results of this preliminary survey, a set of ratings was developed and given to randomly selected samples of ex-students, parents, staff and senior students. A descriptive statistical analysis of this main survey was used in providing answers to the research questions concerning the nature of the school's culture, the influence of the school's organisational structure on it, and how the culture is communicated within the school and to the general public. Data from the main survey were used to develop a set of scales, the Communication of School Culture Instrument, which was used to give comparisons of the perceptions of school culture by the four population sub-groups (viz. ex-students, parents, staff &amp; students) of the school. Statistical findings from the surveys and the CSCI were complemented by a series of in-depth interviews of representatives of the school population sub-groups. Analysis of data suggested that, whilst the school's sub-groups generally shared perceptions about the nature of the school's culture, there were significant differences of opinion about how this culture was communicated and influenced by the school's organisational structure. There was also a significant difference of perspective between the adult males and females of the total school population. An analysis of perspective of ex-students from different time periods of attending the school from the 1920s to present, did not show any significant differences in perspective, suggesting a constancy of the school's culture over time. Several other areas of investigation which would be worthy of further attention are the role of mothers and female members of staff in a boys' school, and the impact of boarding students as a sub-culture would be worthy of further study in this school.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Anglican schools</field><field name="subject">Anglican Church Grammar School</field><field name="subject">School culture</field><field name="subject">Brisbane</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp215.03092009</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Role of the Catholic School Principal in the Face of Modern Day Challenges and Demands: Key behaviours, issues, perceptions, challenges and dilemmas facing Catholic school principals in the late 1990s</field><field name="creator">Slattery, Michael Joseph</field><field name="description">In light of the challenges faced by post-modern principals, and the changes in the Catholic Church and in Catholic education, this study aimed to analyse and identify the work of the principal in a Catholic school in the late 1990s. This meant examining the perceptions of the principal's work as identified by principals themselves, and those key players who work with them in Catholic schools. The study identified the key behaviours of principals in Catholic schools, and the factors that tend to enhance or inhibit their work. In the initial phase of the research, the instrument used in the study was a self administered questionnaire that consisted of 123 key behaviours which respondents were asked to rate according to degree of importance. The second instrument used was a semi-structured interview with a sample of principals. This methodology was designed as a further check on reliability and validity of the questionnaire. It was apparent from this research that in the late 1990s, it was essential that the principal in a Catholic school be committed to creating an authentic Catholic school where a climate of care prevailed, and where respect and privacy for families was upheld. The principal must be committed to whole school philosophy, orientated toward servant leadership, and able to articulate and bring into practice the ethos of a Catholic school. As well, the study showed that it was crucial for the Catholic school principal to ensure appropriate staffing, and that an atmosphere of co-operation and communication existed within the school community. In developing policies that incorporated the ideals of the Vision Statement, the study suggests that the Catholic school principal ensured that excellence in all areas of human growth is treasured. Bearing in mind that each participating group indicated different priorities, support for the principal and the development of skills, is essential for their work to be effective in Catholic schools of the new millennium.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Catholic school principals</field><field name="subject">Catholic schools</field><field name="subject">Catholic education</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp216.04092009</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Teachers, Clergy and Catholic Schools: A study of perceptions of the religious dimension of the mission of Catholic schools and relationships between teachers and clergy in the Lismore Diocese</field><field name="creator">Tinsey, Wayne Maurice</field><field name="description">The Catholic Diocese of Lismore is situated in the north-east coastal area of New South Wales, Australia. Catholic education in this diocese is based on the premise that school and parish work together in partnership for the personal and spiritual development of students. This premise relies on the assumption that teachers and clergy share a common view of the mission of Catholic schools. However, some recent studies highlight a lack of shared vision and indicate that teachers and clergy frequently have different expectations of what Catholic schools should be. This study examines similarities and differences in perceptions of the religious dimension of the mission of Catholic schools among the teachers and clergy in the Lismore Diocese. It identifies areas in which there is a significant lack of congruence. The study also explores the relationships and the quality of partnerships between teachers and clergy and identifies issues that are potential sources of tension. Furthermore, it considers implications for change. Self-completion questionnaires were given to the target population which consisted of all the full time teachers in Catholic schools and all the clergy on active duties in the Lismore Diocese at the beginning of 1997. Subsequent semi-structured interviews were conducted with all the clergy in the group and with thirty two teachers chosen through random sampling. Data yielded little evidence of sustained dialogue between teachers and clergy on issues related to the religious orientation of Catholic schools. Although there were some similarities in the teachers' and priests' perceptions of the religious dimension of the mission of Catholic schools, there was a considerable variation in their perceptions of priorities for these schools. Some of these differences could be linked to teachers' individual relationships with the institutional Catholic Church. Teachers and priests were found to differ significantly in their understanding of the effectiveness of Catholic secondary schools. The study also found that ecclesiastical language used to describe the mission of Catholic schools is not always understood by teachers who work principally out of an educational context. Moreover, the study found that relationships between teachers and clergy were often hindered by poor communication, lack of clarity with regard to roles and expectations and very different perceptions of the structures and practice of authority. Many teachers believed that clergy were 'out of touch' and unrealistic in their expectations of schools and teachers. Many priests, on the other hand, considered that teachers had generally lost a sense of 'vocation' and religious motivation for their involvement in Catholic schools. Priests were generally more interested in forming partnerships with schools than were teachers in forming partnerships with parish communities. The perception that secondary school communities did not relate to parishes as well as their primary counterparts was widespread among clergy. This study makes several recommendations for the improvement of communication and dialogue between teachers and priests. It also recommends that similar research be carried out in dioceses where the parish-school authority structure differs. As part of this study the initial findings were presented to a significant gathering of clergy and school principals. The resulting discussion led to the proposal of strategies for improvement in communication and partnership. In this way the applied research in the study became an agency of change itself, working in the direction of a better culture of communication and collaboration regarding the religious mission of Catholic schools.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Catholic schools</field><field name="subject">Catholic education</field><field name="subject">Catholic Diocese of Lismore</field><field name="subject">Catholic teachers</field><field name="subject">Catholic clergy</field><field name="subject">Lismore, New South Wales</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp218.04092009</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Your biodiversity in my backyard : key local stakeholders' perceptions of biodiversity conservation in Gorontalo, Indonesia</field><field name="creator">Kartikasari, Sri Nurani</field><field name="description">The establishment of protected areas (PAs) has been the key national strategy in biodiversity conservation, through preserving the unique wildlife and ecosystems in Indonesia. As well as their status as sites rich in biodiversity, PAs are also important for socio-economic interactions. Hence the management of PAs has been fraught with technical, social and economic problems. To ensure greater local participation and support in tropical forest conservation initiatives, it is vital to understand how local stakeholders perceive them. This research was undertaken in Gorontalo Province by examining the views of local stakeholders through a combination of qualitative interviews and quantitative ranking exercises. The findings revealed that respondents only understood the concept of biodiversity on a general level. Most respondents defined biodiversity in terms of its elements; only a few were able to describe the interactional attributes, by which biodiversity functions within the ecosystems. Their appreciation of forest biodiversity was primarily due to economic and ecological benefits they derive from local forests. Accordingly, respondents ranked the provision of ecological services from the forests as the strongest reason for protecting it. Using Wood et al. (2000) analytical framework to examine the root causes of biodiversity loss, the findings indicated respondents&#8217; familiarity with human-induced forces resulting in the degradation and loss of natural forests, and they understood how these affect local biodiversity, both within and beyond the forest.  Some critical disconnections between national policy in forest conservation and the reality of the local use of forest resource became apparent. At the core of these disconnections was an unequal share of benefits of such policy to local stakeholders. They identified extraction of species and physical alteration of the forest ecosystem as direct drivers of forest loss; these were perceived as rooted in poverty, institutional failures in forest management, ignorance of the wider forest functions, and conflict of development policies at the local level. The main reason for biodiversity loss can be summed up as widespread and persistent failure to properly understand, quantify, or value the goods, services, functions and capital value of the natural forests, at both national and local levels. Overall, most respondents held negative attitudes towards protected forests and their positive attitudes towards conservation activities were linked with tangible benefits they enjoy from the forest. A key finding of this study is that the conservation of biodiversity cannot be considered in isolation from broader patterns of natural resource use and the socio-political context in which people carry out their lives. This study suggests that the implementation of the centrally-controlled and preservationist conservation approach in Gorontalo has been ineffective in achieving conservation goals. This is due to the lack of a clear connection between this policy and the reality of local forest users.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">conservation policy</field><field name="subject">perception</field><field name="subject">biodiversity</field><field name="subject">Sulawesi</field><field name="subject">Indonesia</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300800 Environmental Science::300804 Environmental impact assessment</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270700 Ecology and Evolution::270708 Conservation and biodiversity</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370100 Sociology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/1188</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The usage of third party logistics in New Zealand : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master in Applied Science in Logistics and Supply Chain Management at Massey University, Albany, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Zhang, Yue</field><field name="description">The aim of this research is to investigate the use of third party logistics in New Zealand companies from the users&#8217; perspective and to identify the improvement opportunities in the New Zealand environment.

However, the urban matrix is not devoid of wildlife. In fact, its capacity to support a wide diversity of fauna is becoming increasingly valued. Urbanisation changes the patterns of resources and habitat structure, creating mosaics of optimal and sub-optimal patches. Therefore we would expect to see changes in the behaviour and ecology of species living in urban habitats. The superb fairy-wren (Malurus cyaneus) is a small insectivorous bird species whose response to urbanisation is unclear. It has been shown to prefer the edges of remnant habitat, particularly in weed-infested areas, yet is patchy in its distribution in urban landscapes, and thought to be in decline there. In this thesis I have examined how (a) vegetation characteristics, (b) territory size, (c) behaviour, including foraging and (d) food availability differ by living in urban habitats compared to rural/remnant habitats. Superb fairy-wrens showed a preference for suburban landscapes with shrubs, usually native, and avoided suburban locations without them. In both rural/remnant edge habitat and suburban habitat they were also associated with the introduced weed lantana (Lantana camara). It is likely that this shrub provides important shelter, especially in the absence of native vegetation that provides equivalent structure. Radio-tracking of female superb fairy-wrens revealed that territories in suburban locations were, on average, half the size of territories in rural/remnant habitats when calculated using the minimum convex polygon method. Calculations made with the fixed kernel method indicated that there was no difference in territory size. This difference in size calculated by different methods suggests that superb fairy&#172; wrens utilise more of the vegetation within suburban territories and avoid larger areas of unsuitable habitat in rural/remnant edge locations. The sizes of both the suburban and rural/remnant habitats were similar to that in higher quality fragmented habitats, as calculated by previous studies. Regardless of the location of their territories, superb fairy-wrens foraged largely on the ground but spent the most of their time, on average, in shrubs. Males spent significantly longer foraging in suburban locations than rural/remnant habitat, with females showing the same, but non-significant trend. This increase in foraging time was not taken at the expense of other behaviours however and appeared to be due to the size of food items in suburban territories. The biomass of individual arthropods was smaller in suburban locations than rural/remnant territories but the total biomass per site was the same, largely due to the greater abundance of orthopterans in rural/remnant areas. This suggests that superb fairy-wrens foraged for longer in suburban territories to obtain equivalent intake to that in rural/remnant territories. Suburban areas without superb fairy-wrens did not have a lower biomass of arthropods than suburban fairy-wren territories and therefore it is unlikely that birds in suburban habitats were selecting their territories based on food availability. Superb fairy-wrens instead appear restricted in their distribution in urban habitats due to a shortage of suitable vegetation, primarily comprised of the shrub layer. While there were changes to food resources, the flexible behaviour of this species with urbanisation allows it to modify its foraging behaviour to compensate for this difference. We do not know the long term consequences faced by individuals occupying the urban landscape, but it appears that that these two habitats, with varying degrees of urban impact, provide suitable habitat for this species to persist.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/821</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of kynurenine and UV light in lens protein modification</field><field name="creator">Parker, Nicole R</field><field name="description">Human lens proteins become progressively modified by tryptophan-derived UV filter compounds in an age-dependent manner. Kynurenine, for example, undergoes deamination at physiological pH, and the product binds covalently to the nucleophilic residues in protein via a Michael addition. Key sites of kynurenine modification in human lens proteins include cysteine, histidine and lysine residues. The factors determining the levels of Kyn-amino acid adducts in vivo are not known. An aim of this study was to determine the rate of reaction of Kyn with nucleophilic amino acids (His, Cys and Lys) under physiological conditions (pH 7.2, 37&#176;C) and to evaluate the stability of the Kyn-amino acid adducts under these conditions. Kinetic and stability studies were performed using both free amino acids and modified calf lens protein, and reactions analysed by high performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. Kinetic studies using free amino acids revealed that Cys reacted with Kyn at approximately three times the rate of His and four times the rate of Lys. Kyn-t-Boc-His was found to be the most stable of all the Kyn-amino acid adducts under physiological conditions, followed by Kyn-t-Boc-Cys and Kyn-t-Boc-Lys. Kyn-t-Boc-Lys and Kyn-Cys decomposed under physiological conditions, releasing deaminated Kyn. Kyn-Cys was the least stable of the Kyn-amino acid adducts. Incubation of Kyn-Cys in the presence of excess of t-Boc-L-His resulted in a decrease in Kyn-Cys and a corresponding increase in Kyn-t-Boc-His, due to the transfer of deaminated Kyn. Addition of a t-Boc group to the &#61665;-amino group of Cys increased the stability of the Kyn-Cys adduct by a factor of three. Oxidation of Kyn-t-Boc-Cys to a sulfoxide derivative decreased the stability by a factor of three. Kinetic studies performed with calf lens protein incubated with Kyn showed that Cys was the preferred site of Kyn modification, followed by His and Lys, repectively. Following 14 days of incubation, Kyn-Cys was present at 12- and 17-fold greater levels than Kyn-His and Kyn-Lys. Protein-bound Kyn-Cys appeared more stable than the free Kyn-Cys adduct and was similar in stability to the free Kyn-t-Boc-Cys adduct. Under these conditions, protein-bound Kyn-His levels increased by 38%, whereas Kyn-Lys decreased by 28% with incubation time. Protein-bound Kyn-Lys was also relatively more stable compared the free Kyn-amino acid adduct. Both the free amino acid and calf lens protein studies confirmed that Cys was the best nucleophile at physiological pH, followed by His and Lys. Kyn-His, however, was the most stable modification. The final pattern of Kyn-modification was shown to be a factor of amino acid reactivity and stability rather than amino acid abundance. Another aim of this study was to explore the hypothesis that protein-bound Kyn is oxidised in the cataractous lens, as the levels of Kyn-His and Kyn-Lys decrease by a factor of 4 with increasing severity of age-related nuclear (ARN) cataract. Model studies were performed in which Kyn-t-Boc-His and Kyn-t-Boc-Lys were incubated in the presence of an equimolar concentration of hydrogen peroxide. These studies showed that hydrogen peroxide did not affect the decomposition of either adduct under physiological conditions, suggesting that decomposition of these species in the cataractous lens may be the result of other factors, for example, stronger oxidising agents. The final aim of this study was to investigate the photochemistry of proteinbound Kyn. Previous studies have shown that Kyn, when free in solution, is an inefficient sensitizer of oxidative damage. However, the photochemistry of proteinbound UV filter molecules has not been investigated and this may be of significance, especially for the older human lens, as a result of the decline in free Kyn and an increase in the bound form. Lens proteins covalently modified with kynurenine were susceptible to photooxidation by wavelengths of light that penetrate the cornea (UVA light &#955;&gt;305, &gt;345 and &gt;385 nm). These wavelengths were chosen because light in the 300-400 nm band are absorbed by the lens. Hydrogen peroxide and protein-bound peroxides were found to accumulate in a time-dependent manner after exposure to UV light (&#955; 305-385 nm), with shorter wavelength light generating more peroxides. Peroxide formation was accompanied by increases in the levels of protein-bound tyrosine oxidation products dityrosine and 3,4- ihydroxyphenylalanine, species known to be elevated in human cataract lens proteins. Experiments using D2O, which enhances the lifetime of singlet oxygen, and azide, a potent scavenger of this species, are consistent with oxidation being mediated by singlet oxygen. These findings provide a mechanistic explanation of UV light-mediated protein oxidation in cataract lenses, and also rationalise the occurrence of age-related cataract in the nuclear region of the lens, as modification of lens protein by UV filters occurs primarily in this region.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/142</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Security and privacy model for association databases</field><field name="creator">Kong, Yibing</field><field name="description">With the rapid development of information technology, data availability is improved greatly. Data may be accessed at anytime by people from any location. However,threats to data security and privacy arise as one of the major problems of the development of information systems, especially those information systems which contain personal information. An association database is a personal information system which contains associations between persons. In this thesis, we identify the security and privacy problems of association databases. In order to solve these problems, we propose a new security and privacy model for association databases equipped with both direct access control and inference control mechanisms. In this model, there are multiple criteria including, not only confidentiality, but also privacy and other aspects of security to classify the association. The methods used in the system are: The direct access control method is based on the mandatory model; The inference control method is based on both logic reasoning and probabilistic reasoning (Belief Networks). My contributions to security and privacy model for association databases and to inference control in the model include: Identification of security and privacy problems in association databases; Formal definition of association database model; Representation association databases as directed multiple graphs; Development of axioms for direct access control; Specification of the unauthorized inference problem; A method for unauthorized inference detection and control that includes: Development of logic inference rules and probabilistic inference rule; Application of belief networks as a tool for unauthorized inference detection and control.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">information technology &#8226; data security &#8226; privacy &#8226; associations &#8226; association databases &#8226; direct access control &#8226; inference control &#8226; inference detection &#8226; unauthorized inference &#8226; confidentiality &#8226; mandatory model &#8226; logic reasoning &#8226; probabilistic reasoning &#8226; belief networks &#8226; logic inference rules &#8226; probabilistic inference rule</field><field name="subject">Computer Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/8</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">IMF conditionality and rule of law: exceptional powers and banking in Malaysia and Venezuela</field><field name="creator">Garcia, Gabriel</field><field name="description">The 1990s was a decade marked by the implementation of market reforms worldwide.  Countries in Latin America and Asia experimented with neoliberal programs sponsored by international financial institutions (IFIs) in order to adopt the arrangements required for the functioning of a market economy.  The International Monetary Fund (IMF) joined in these efforts and incorporated structural requirements in its programs as conditions for the provision of financial assistance, including requirements associated with the strengthening of governance and the rule of law that limited the scope of ad hoc decision making schemes. However, by the end of the 1990s the results of IMF-sponsored reforms were controversial.This thesis explores, from a legal perspective, IMF conditionality as a mechanism to strengthen the rule of law and the relations between these two concepts and exceptional powers in the banking sector.  The main argument developed in this thesis is that in spite of the official discourse regarding the promotion of governance and the rule of law, IMF conditionality did not contribute to strengthening this notion in the 1990s. In contrast, conditionality was involved with episodes of instability and the invocation of states of emergency in some developing countries. The analysis is undertaken through a comparative case study approach in which the legal responses of the governments of Malaysia and Venezuela to address the financial crises that affected those countries in the 1990s are examined.  Malaysia declined the help of the IMF during the crash and instead it implemented its own program to manage the financial turmoil.  The Malaysian solution provides useful insights and differences from the ad hoc legal management crisis style employed by the Venezuelan government that had the technical and financial assistance of the IMF.Overall, the findings of this thesis suggest that in the case of Venezuela, IMF conditionality did not contribute to the strengthening of the rule of law and the urgency of the measures contributed to the use of exceptional powers by the Venezuelan government in addressing the banking crisis.  In contrast, Malaysia, a nation that adopted its own domestic solution, provides a more adequate legal management approach to a financial crisis that helped to strengthen the rule of law in the banking system.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/823</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A non-invasive analysis of the structure and function of human multi-segmental muscle</field><field name="creator">McAndrew, Darryl John</field><field name="description">The Central Nervous System (CNS) exerts extensive control over muscle activation in order to produce accurate voluntary movement, such as the complex movements of the human shoulder joint.  Muscles surrounding multi-planar joints are selectively activated depending upon the movement performed, and within the radiate musculature of the shoulder, individual muscle segments exist that are capable of exhibiting specific myoelectric intensity and temporal activation patterns.  The aim of this thesis was to assess the influence of inter-segment variations in contractile properties on the strategies employed by the CNS when producing voluntary movements.  Experiments were designed to test the hypothesis that muscle segment neuromotor coordination (as determined by electromyographic analysis) would be sensitive to the contractile properties of individual muscle segments.  A key component was the variation in isometric contraction speed ranging from slow to ballistic.Mechanomyography (MMG), which is the measure of a muscle&#8217;s physical dimensional change during contraction, is founded on the premise that the temporal aspect of muscle displacement is reflective of motor unit contractile properties and consequently the muscle fibre type composition.  A series of studies were completed to establish the validity of the new Laser-MMG technique for quantifying contractile properties.  The results confirmed: 1) the sensitivity of the Laser-MMG technique to modulators of physiological performance (thermal state, fatigue state, and fibre type composition variation between segments); and 2) that the contractile properties of muscle fibres varied between the individual segments of the muscles following maximal percutaneous neuromuscular stimulation (PNS).  Most notably, &#8216;slow-twitch&#8217; contractile properties were found in muscle segments that have a greater role in producing movement in the coronal plane, while &#8216;fast-twitch&#8217; contractile properties were associated with segments having more efficient moment arms to produce movement in the sagittal plane.  Furthermore, each of the muscles investigated was associated with a distinctive anatomical distribution of muscle fibre types.  Muscle segment contractile properties were heterogeneous and their arrangement appears to reflect the most common or important joint movements.   Moreover, the muscle segments located at the periphery of all three shoulder muscles exhibited faster contractile properties than those located in the middle of the muscle.  It appears that this internal arrangement may be a consistent organisational characteristic of radiate muscles.  Muscle segments within the pectoralis major, deltoid and latissimus dorsi muscles were found to be independently controlled by the CNS through manipulation of the myoelectric activation patterns, in particular: onset time; and discharge rate.  The lower segments of the pectoralis major and the latissimus dorsi were identified as prime mover segments, initiating the movement and contributing the greatest myoelectric intensity.  The immediately superior segments were classified as assistant movers, activating after the prime movers and contributing less to the overall movement.  Furthermore, similarities in neuromotor coordination were identified between adjacent segments of individual muscles. The sequential &#8220;wave of segment activation&#8221; identified within each whole muscle appeared to ignore the anatomical boundaries between muscles, suggesting that the CNS coordinates individual muscle segments rather than the whole muscle as one unit in order to complete a motor task.  This further complicates the process of controlling motor tasks as there appear to be no defined limits of muscles to which discrete functions can be applied.Coordination between prime mover segments of agonist muscles was identified, with the lower segments of pectoralis major and latissimus dorsi showing no significant difference in any of the temporal myoelectric measures.  The similarity in neuromotor coordination between these segments may be the result of a common drive, suggesting that the CNS uses a simple strategy of combining the segments into one functional unit.  No gross disordering of the muscle segments&#8217; onset was identified within any of the investigated muscles, with regard to movement speed.  However, the pectoralis major exhibited altered relative timing between the segments. This was particularly evident during the fast movement.  The sequential &#8220;wave of activation&#8221; present during the slow movements became disordered as muscle contraction speed was increased.  During fast contraction, the assistant mover segments within pectoralis major were activated later than the prime mover segments changing the relative timing of their activation.  This indicates that the CNS may initially prioritise the activation of only the most essential muscle segments to commence the movement during ballistic movements, perhaps due to the imposed time constraints.  This form of change in relative timing can be interpreted as a direct reflection of the differences in muscle segment fibre type composition and hence the neuromotor control of the muscle segments involved in producing the movement.  Most notably, variation to the control of muscle segment excitation and contraction onset exist in the more centrally located muscle segments that exhibit slower segment contractile properties.  This finding appears logical when coupled with the finding of homogeneous myoelectric peak activity.  The CNS must manipulate the onset of these slower contracting segments, especially during fast movements, in order to allow enough time for all segments to achieve a uniform peak of muscle activity that occurs just prior to peak force.	The variations and coordination of contractile properties, myoelectric properties and electromyographic burst patterns between adjacent muscle segments within the same skeletal muscle confirms the notion that for CNS control, individual muscle segments are considered as sub-volumes of muscle tissue that require individual neuromotor control &#8211; that they are, in effect, muscles within muscles.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/822</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mathematical modelling of nanostructures</field><field name="creator">Baowan, Duangkamon</field><field name="description">Worldwide nanotechnology is a major focus in science and technology, and most research in this area deals with chemical, physical and biological issues or a combination of these areas, but to date very little work has been undertaken on mathematical modelling. Rather than employing large-scale computations using molecular dynamics simulation, in this thesis elementary mechanical principles and classical applied mathematical modelling procedures are utilised to examine three specific areas in nanotechnology.Firstly, the Lennard-Jones potential function for the non-bonded interaction potential energy between two molecules and the continuum approximation, which assumes that the interatomic interactions can be modelled by smearing the atoms uniformly across surfaces, are undertaken to investigate the mechanical properties of certain nanostructures, namely double-walled carbon nanotubes, nanopeapods, nanocones and carbon onions. O wing to their special mechanical, electrical and thermal properties, these nanostructures promise many applications for future nanoscale devices, such as nano-bearings and nano-oscillators. This thesis examines issues regarding nano-oscillators constructed from these nanostructures. In particular, the van derWaals interaction energy, the suction energy, the o&#174; set location and the oscillatory behaviour are determined. Analytical expressions are obtained as a function of the radii and the lengths of the structures. In addition, all the predicted mechanical properties derived here are in excellent agreement with results from molecular dynamics simulations.The second area is the joining of nanostructures by invoking the principle that the atoms arrange themselves in such a way that the total squared deviation of the distance between atoms at the junction and some ideal bond length is a minimum. Initially, toroidal molecules are described, which are formed from three distinct carbon nanotube sections, through minimisation of the total squared deviation of the distance between two carbon atoms at the junction from the ideal physical bond length. Representative formulae for the mean generating toroidal radius and tube radius of the tori are determined. Following this is to determine the perpendicular joining structures for carbon nanotubes and flat graphene by two least squares approaches, which are the variation in bond length and the variation in bond angle. Such a combined structure might constitute a transmission platform for ultra small computer chips. Given that the corresponding boron nitride nanostructures are also good semiconductors, the corresponding combined structures are also determined. However, the essential mathematical ideas for combining boron nitride structures are quite different to those required for connecting the corresponding carbon structures, since only rings with an even number of sides are energetically favourable.The third area in this thesis involves the elastic model of carbon nanotubes. Here, carbon nanotubes are assumed to be modelled as transversely isotropic linearly elastic materials which have the same properties in one plane, but vary in the normal direction to this plane. The equilibrium equations are derived and they can be shown to generalise those for isotropic materials. Further, wave-like deformations on the outer-most surface of the oscillating carbon nanotubes are investigated. On neglecting any frictional effects and assuming that the inner surface atoms of the outer tube and those located on the outer surface of the inner tube dominate the van der Waals force, expressions for displacements in the r- and z-directions are obtained.The major contribution of this thesis is the use of conventional applied mathe- matical modelling techniques to formulate analytical expressions for nanostructures. Broadly three mechanical issues are studied, including (i) van der Waals interaction energy and oscillatory behaviour for nanostructures, (ii) geometry of combining two nanostructures and (iii) deformation of carbon nanotubes as transversely isotropic materials. However, many of the theoretical structures proposed here have yet to be confirmed either experimentally or by molecular dynamics simulations; and as such the work might be considered as a first step to settling some of the important physical principles in nanotechnology. In summary, the new elements of the thesis comprise:&#8226;	Analytical expressions to determine the equilibrium locations, force distributions and oscillatory behaviours for nested nanostructures,&#8226;	Simple least squares methods to connect two nanostructures,&#8226;	Elastic model for the deformations of double-walled carbon nanotubes.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/51</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Conditionally Sexual: Constructing the sexual health needs of men and teenage boys with a moderate to profound intellectual disability</field><field name="creator">Wilson, Nathan John</field><field name="description">Doctor of Philosophy (PhD)</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Intellectual disability</field><field name="subject">sexual health</field><field name="subject">masculinity</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/5387</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Enhancing life effectiveness : the impacts of outdoor education programs</field><field name="creator">Neill, James T.</field><field name="description">Outdoor education offers a promising method for developing life skills, however this field is undermined by ad hoc theory and limited research. This thesis offers a critical synthesis of theoretical and empirical outdoor education literature, develops instrumentation to measure life effectiveness, and reports on a large, longitudinal study of outdoor education program life effectiveness outcomes. Outdoor education was reviewed as consisting of seven theoretically interactive domains (participant, environment, program, activity, group, instructor, and culture) within a dynamic, experiential milieu. A theoretical systems framework is proposed, drawing on Dewey&#8217;s theory of experience, to illustrate how participants&#8217; experiences of outdoor education might be understood as arising within a &#8220;complex system&#8221;. A critical review of traditional and meta-analytic reviews of empirical outdoor education research indicated small-moderate positive impacts on typically measured outcomes (e.g. self-concept, locus of control, and social skills; ES ~ 0.35). However, this research has been limited by a lack of appropriate dependent measures, low statistical power, over-reliance on inferential statistics, a lack of control and comparison groups, a lack of longitudinal data, and a lack of investigation of independent variables. To address such issues, Study 1 developed new measurement instrumentation and Study 2 conducted a large, longitudinal study. &#8220;Life effectiveness&#8221; was proposed to refer to generic life skills which facilitate surviving and thriving across a variety of situations. Life effectiveness skills were further proposed to be enhanceable through intervention. Study 1 investigated the psychometrics of the 11-factor, 64-item Life Effectiveness Questionnaire version G (LEQ-G) through congeneric and confirmatory factor analyses (N = 1,164). Three problematic factors and several weaker items were removed, leading to an 8-factor, 24-item model (LEQ-H) with an excellent fit (TLI = .984; N = 1,892). A global second-order model also provided an excellent fit (TLI = .980), with evidence for factorial invariance of the second-order factor across gender and age, and promising evidence for factorial invariance of the first-order model. Further development of the LEQ was recommended to consider construct validity, other life effectiveness factors, and ongoing item development (e.g. to reduce skewness).</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">outdoor education</field><field name="subject">life skills</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/40186</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The dance between cosmography and chorography : mapping Australia</field><field name="creator">Coppard, Sally A.</field><field name="description">This thesis proposes that maps contain much more than just a depiction of physical space. Focusing on a selection of maps of &#8216;Australia&#8217;, the following attributes are found in some of these maps: myth and imagination, memory, power and the evolution of a people&#8217;s relationship with a place. Each attribute is the centrepiece of a separate chapter.  The investigation undertaken here begins before &#8216;Australia&#8217; was a known, named and mapped identity, at least as far as Europe was concerned, and continues up to the present day. It moves from maps of the imagined, the unknown and the theoretical, the science of cosmography, to chorography, which concerns maps of the local and the known. Cosmography operates on the grandest scale attempting to depict the whole world whereas chorography attempts to map details that can be recognised on the land.  The words cosmography and chorography have fallen into disuse but the meanings of both were re-examined for this work, allowing for a unique mapping picture to emerge. The dance between these two kinds of mapping is the methodological pivot around which this thesis revolves. Chapter one begins in the theoretical realm of cosmography with the creation of the Antipodes, an idea that arose as a consequence of classical and Hellenistic Greek philosophical and theoretical concepts. This land only existed on maps yet came to harbour myths and imaginary attributes. Although replaced by Terra Australis Incognita, fantasy and myth continued to inhabit this southern part of the mapped world. Explorers eroded the unknown until a European chorographical destination, Botany Bay, was mapped into place. The dance then began all over again across the landmass called &#8216;Australia&#8217; as the boundary between the known and unknown was crossed and mapped. Chapter two is a detailed study of the minutiae on chorographical maps of the Burragorang Valley and surrounding area. The names used for various geographical features are shown to contain memories of past inhabitants both Aboriginal and European. These memories still exist on maps of this area whereas the land the maps depict has been radically altered by the inclusion of man-made lake that has all but removed the earlier human marks on the landscape. The power embedded in both cosmographical and chorographical maps is examined in chapter three. In 1493 Pope Alexander VI drew a line on a cosmographical map and &#8216;donated&#8217; half the non-Christian world to Spain and half to Portugal, thus commencing a process whereby a few European Christian nations carved up the rest of the world with the help of the authority vested in cosmographical maps. This culminated, as far as Australia was concerned, with Lieutenant James Cook&#8217;s map of the east coast of New Holland, which enabled the British Crown to claim land to the east of the 135th meridian, the line Alexander VI had drawn. Within sixty years this claim had expanded and covered the whole of the Australian landmass. On the ground, chorography recorded each individual parcel of land as it changed from Aboriginal land to European property. In chapter four, the concern is the way maps facilitated an evolving relationship between European Australians and the land they came to inhabit rather than the use of the maps in colonial appropriation. The focus in this chapter is on marginal lands where little European involvement is evident either on the ground or on the map. Because it is here in less trampled areas that any European marker on a map becomes important, and because there are so few of these markers, it is possible to trace the way these key features have evolved and have taken on a new significance over time.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cartography</field><field name="subject">map drawing</field><field name="subject">poliitical aspects</field><field name="subject">social aspects</field><field name="subject">cosmography</field><field name="subject">chorography</field><field name="subject">maps</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/40258</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Way of life theory: the underlying structure of worldviews, social relations and lifestyles</field><field name="creator">Pepperday, Michael Edward</field><field name="description">What is the structure of society?  Many thinkers have pondered the regularities.  Way of life theory (WOLT) shows the relationship of every rational, social issue to every other rational, social issue.  
&#182;
From two dichotomised, theoretical dimensions called grid and group, Mary Douglas deduced four ways of life usually called individualism, hierarchy, egalitarianism, and fatalism.  WOLT shows the same four ideal types may be deduced from any significant pair of social issues, including competition, cooperation, coercion, freedom, justice, self-identity, nature, human nature, and more.  Since four types may be divided pair-wise in three ways, there are three, not two, dimensions or axes.  
&#182;
WOLT also deduces Douglas&#146;s fifth type (the hermit) and resolves the long-standing logical anomalies of grid-group theory.  
&#182;
In all, seven social theorists have independently deduced four types from various dimension pairs.  Mistakes aside, they find the same four theoretical types.  Evidently, the four types are natural kinds.  Between them these theorists use three axes.  
&#182;
Numerous intuitive theorists from across social science have developed types without dimensions, and dimensions without types.  Though incomplete, they show no significant disagreement.  
&#182;
It appears that every issue that must be taken into account to live socially fits the three axes.  There is no flexibility: each issue fits the axes one way.  Geometrically, three dichot&#172;omised dimensions yield eight types, however four of them are not viable and do not arise.  Given just four valid points, the number of dimensions is necessarily limited to three.  The axes generate thousands of predictions.  
&#182;
Since deduction yields the same four types whatever issues are placed on the dimensions, the four types are, like objects of natural science, independent of any theorist.  In turn, these four types control which issues fit and how they fit, delimiting the scope and refining the meaning of the issues&#151;which places the issues, too, beyond any theorist&#146;s determination.  
&#182;
As in natural science, the sphere of application is set by the deductive theory, not by a theorist&#146;s pronouncement: what fits, fits.  The domain appears to cover matters which people must take a position on to live socially.  Emotional and internal personal issues will not fit.  
&#182;
WOLT sharpens meaning, formalises structure and extends connections in areas as diverse as equality, liberalism, game theory, corporate culture, national culture, political right and left, religion, and working-class health.  
&#182;
Like a natural science theory, WOLT is relational, not only taxonomic.  As in natural science, no person, organisation, or social situation will conform exactly to its ideal types.  It is falsifiable by deducing, or finding empirically, rival social types or a social phenomenon that will not fit.  Empirical testing of the theory as a whole is awkward owing to its structure and to parochial effects.  Three data sets failed to refute it.  
&#182;
WOLT reveals how every social issue relates to every other social issue, providing a tool for analysing worldview, social structure, and social behaviour.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">political culture</field><field name="subject">grid-group</field><field name="subject">worldviews</field><field name="subject">social relations</field><field name="subject">social structure</field><field name="subject">individualism</field><field name="subject">hierarchy</field><field name="subject">egalitarianism</field><field name="subject">fatalism</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20090906.142757</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Investigation of the Role of Trust in Virtual Project Management Success</field><field name="creator">mumbick@consultant.com</field><field name="description">Studies show that virtual project teams, as an organizational working structure, are
on the increase so organizations need assurance that they can be managed just as
effectively as traditional projects. The virtual project structure introduces new
challenges for project managers tasked with the job of delivering project success.
One such challenge is the development and maintenance of trust within the virtual
environment. Trust plays a major role in fostering relationships not only in teams but
also in society in general.

The aim of the research is to explore the role of trust in virtual project teams and to
investigate how trust influences project outcomes. Data was collected from a survey
of members of the Project Management Institute. A model of trust in the virtual team
environment is proposed and tested using Partial Least Squares (PLS). Analysis of
the data shows that team trust predicts project success. Institution-based trust is
found to have an influence on swift trust; however, the role of swift trust on virtual
project success was less clear. The study also finds that the perceived traditional
experience of the project manager does not have any influence on virtual project
success.

Project managers must be aware of both interpersonal as well as organizational
factors of trust as they plan for project success. They may find that there is a need to
review their skills in readiness for the virtual project environment. This dissertation
adds to the body of knowledge by providing insights into trust dynamics in the
virtual project structure.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20071213.92259</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of diagnostic tools to improve the detection of Trypanosoma evansi in Australia</field><field name="creator">c.smuts@murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">The aim of this study was to evaluate new methods to improve detection and investigation of the effects of chronic or subclinical infection with Trypanosoma evansi in various mammalian species. Some of the more resistant host species, including pigs and buffaloes, are present in large feral populations in the northern parts of Australia, the area where T. evansi is most likely to gain entry to the country. Existing tests are not sufficiently reliable to detect all cases of disease and they cannot distinguish acute from chronic infections. Furthermore, the tests have different sensitivities in different host species. 

Surveillance for trypanosomiasis in Australia is problematic because of the need to work in remote parts of northern Australia where provision of a cold-chain for traditional blood and serum storage is difficult. An existing dried blood storage system was modified by treating cotton lint filter paper (Whatman #903) with a commercial post coating buffer (TropBio, Queensland). This treatment increased the longevity of antibodies to T. evansi in serum and blood stored on the paper (detected using an antibody-detection ELISA) compared to samples stored on plain paper, especially when the papers were stored under humid conditions and at high ambient temperatures.

Attempts were made to improve the diagnostic utility and repeatability of antibody-ELISAs through the use of 2 recombinant T. brucei antigens (PFRA and GM6) and to optimize a competitive ELISA using RoTat 1.2 variable surface antigen and its monoclonal antibody. Antibody-detection using the two recombinant proteins was not sufficiently specific to enable their use for the detection of T. evansi. The RoTat 1.2 cELISA had good sensitivity and specificity (75% and 98% respectively) when used to test serum from cattle and buffaloes experimentally infected with T. evansi and uninfected animals. However, the test was not able to detect anti-T. evansi antibodies in serum from wallabies, pigs, a dog or a horse that were experimentally infected with T. evansi. The inability of the cELISA to detect anti-T. evansi antibodies may be due to the small number of samples tested or the lack of RoTat 1.2 specific antibodies in the animals tested. 

The feasibility of using an enzymatic test to detect trypanosome aminotransferase or antibodies to this enzyme was evaluated. Prior publications suggested that the detection of TAT was an appropriate diagnostic tool for the detection of T. evansi infection in camels. However, the results from this study did not support the use of this test for the detection of T. evansi infection in cattle or buffaloes with low to moderate parasitaemia. 

Trypanosomiasis is an immunological disease that affects most of the body&#146;s organs, with more severe disease developing over time. Attempts were made to determine key cytokine and biochemical patterns that would distinguish infected from uninfected animals and acute from chronic infections. The results from this study showed that there was no specific pattern in serum cytokines or serum biochemistry that could be used to distinguish infected from uninfected animals, or different stages of disease. 

Immunohistochemistry was used on tissues from buffaloes and mice experimentally infected with T. evansi and T. brucei gambiense respectively to characterise the cellular immune response that was present. The immune response was predominantly cell mediated, with CD3+ T lymphocyte and macrophage infiltration occurring in most tissues. In end stage disease there was often suppression of the immune system with disruption of the architecture of the spleen and a decrease in B lymphocytes in the circulation. 

Trypanosomes were rarely visible in the tissues and were only seen in those animals with high parasitaemia. Lesions generally became more severe over time, but there was a large variation between animals, which suggests that immunohistochemistry is unsuitable as a diagnostic tool.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Trypanosoma evansi</field><field name="subject">dried serum storage</field><field name="subject">subclinical disease</field><field name="subject">immunohistochemistry</field><field name="subject">competitive ELISA</field><field name="subject">immunology</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20090709.113425</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The biology and prevalence of Cirolana hesperia and their effect on the Western Rocklobster Fishery</field><field name="creator">andrew@wrlc.com.au</field><field name="description">The current study had two overriding and inter-related aims. The first was to describe the biology of C. hesperia the dominant scavenging subtidal cirolanid found in temperate waters off the Perth metropolitan coastline and thereby extend our knowledge and test several hypotheses regarding the biology of scavenging crustaceans in general. The second was to use the biological information generated to develop fishing practices that reduce the amount of bait used by trap based fisheries without reducing the overall catch. Fulfilling the latter aim has the potential to greatly reduce some of the deleterious effects of fishing practices around the world.

A survey was designed to determine whether the anecdotal evidence that commercial rocklobster fishers believe sea lice have a negative impact on the ratio of bait used to rocklobster landed was widespread across the fishery and, if so, whether they associated particular factors with increases or decreases in lice numbers. The response rate of over 40% was high for a survey of this type and had similar return rates across all zones of the fishery. Such a high return rate, in addition to the responses confirms that commercial fishers, regardless of zone, consider that sea lice have adverse effects on the ratio of bait used to rocklobster landed.

The findings of the survey allowed the following conclusions to be drawn and hypotheses developed. Commercial fishers believe particular temporal and spatial factors are associated with increased numbers of sea lice predating on rocklobster baits. For example, fishing in depth ranges of 20 - 30 fathoms (40 &#150; 60 metres) and greater, fishing on a sand bottom, fishing during the months of November, December, March and April, fishing during the full and new moons and lastly during periods of weak current and high water temperature were all felt to increase the number of sea lice scavenging on baits.

Laboratory growth trials demonstrated significant differences in the mean body lengths of starved and fed manca and adult C. hesperia after three and seven months, respectively. Despite these findings, starved adult C. hesperia continued to moult and grow after approximately 300 days of fasting. The relatively short period of time before differences in starved and fed manca C. hesperia growth parameters arose is probably due to early life stages of cirolanids being more reliant on regular food sources than their adult counterparts. An increase in water temperature from 16 &#186;C to 24 &#186;C resulted in no significant increase in mean body length of manca C. hesperia. However, the mean inter-moult period of fed manca housed at 24 &#186;C was significantly lower (25-50%) than both the fed treatment group housed at 16 &#186;C and the starved treatment group within the first two months of the trial. This reduction in mean inter-moult period is indicative of an animal which is growing quickly as a result of increased metabolic rate albeit at reduced increments.

The 24 hour activity rhythms of C. hesperia in shallow waters in the metropolitan zone of the Western Rocklobster Fishery were determined in order to identify those factors which modulate the emergence and/or swimming activity of this dominant scavenger. It was concluded that the presence of a circadian rhythm of spontaneous nocturnal activity induced by the end of the diurnal period of photo-inhibition,regardless of tidal regime or lunar cycle, is evident in adult C. hesperia. In contrast, circa-tidal rhythms of emergence centered around spring tides were found to exist in juvenile C. hesperia with similar mean numbers trapped across all sampling times (see Chapter 3, tables 3.4-3.8) with the exception of high water spring tides (HWS), which resulted in significantly greater mean numbers. It was concluded that mature cirolanids found off the Western Australian coastline adopt a strictly nocturnal and facultative necrophage mode of existence despite carrion generally being regarded as a much less crucial food resource in relatively shallow, productive, inshore waters. However, juvenile cirolanids found off the Western Australian coastline were recognised as relying on a more opportunistic scavenger mode of existence being active during both day and night. This perpetual foraging strategy employed in cirolanids at manca and juvenile stages is possibly due to the lack of the well developed chemosensory and or olfactory capabilities found in their adult stages. In addition to this reduced foraging efficiency, a smaller gut size combined with higher metabolic rates and lower assimilation efficiencies ensures their ongoing search for sustenance.

Analyses of the number of C. hesperia collected during three years of trapping in C zone of the Western Rocklobster Fishery clearly demonstrated that the numbers of cirolanids caught in rocklobster pots were significantly affected by bottom type, moon phase and depth. With respect to bottom type, the greatest numbers of C. hesperia were trapped in rocklobster pots deployed on weed/rock and sand bottoms while significantly lower numbers of C. hesperia were trapped on rock or weed bottoms. In regards to moon phase, rocklobster pots deployed during the new and last quarter of the moon phase trapped significantly greater numbers of both C. hesperia and the Western Rocklobster, P. cygnus than those deployed during the full and first quarter phases. Rocklobster pots containing lice traps deployed in depths ranging from 10-19 and 20-29 fathoms (20-39 and 40-59 metres respectively) caught significantly greater numbers of C. hesperia and P. cygnus than pots deployed in the 1-19 metre depth range. Lastly, the catchability of both C. hesperia and P. cygnus was greatest when either Australian salmon or blue mackerel was deployed in pots indicating these scavengers do exercise a degree of selectivity with respect to particular bait types.

Whilst ovigerous C. hesperia were present in each month of the year, peaks in their abundance and/or catchability occurred at the height of summer (January to March). These peaks in mpm, i.e. morphological parturial moult stage, C. hesperia were then followed by corresponding peaks in recruitment from April to June. I hypothesise that peaks in the reproductive intensity of C. hesperia can be attributed to peaks in water temperature and also the seasonal influx of carrion due to both recreational and commercial charter fishing and the commencement of the rocklobster season all occurring predominately within a similar time frame, i.e. the warmer months.

The current study has clearly demonstrated that a plethora of factors attract high numbers of both C. hesperia and P. cygnus. Thus, it is apparent that those practices employed by commercial fishers to land the greatest number of P. cygnus will also attract significant numbers of C. hesperia to rocklobster baits. Irrespective of key factors driving C. hesperia abundance, the high market price received for P. cygnus in conjunction with the relatively low price payed for bait, ensures fishers will continue to deploy rocklobster pots in the manner which maximises their landings. Thus for a reduction in bait usage to offer significant economic savings to the industry, different methods of bait deployment that do not result in a decrease in the catch of P. cygnus must be developed.

A series of baitsaver trials were conducted in order to determine whether baitsavers deployed containing reduced quantities of bait would catch the same numbers of rocklobster as conventional pots using the typical amounts of bait employed in the fishery. During the start of the season the majority of fishers concentrate their efforts in shallow waters and employ predominantly one day soaks as they target rocklobster migrating from the shallows to offshore habitats (whites phase &#150; November to February). In the later parts of the season (reds phase &#150; March to June) fishing effort becomes less concentrated as some fishers continue to fish the inshore grounds whilst others move out into deeper waters. The season long trial demonstrated that packing large quantities of bait in both baitboxes in the pot (traditional method) caught significantly more rocklobster than pots using a baitsaver in one bait box while the other bait box was packed in traditional fashion (combined method) during the first two months of the whites phase. However, during the remainder of the season there was no significant difference in catches between the two methods. Thus, the season-long trial found that the use of traditional methods of bait deployment in the first two months of the season in conjunction with the combined method of bait deployment from January until the end of the commercial season has the potential to save inshore and offshore based fishers $34,000 and $36,000 each year.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">rocklobster</field><field name="subject">sea lice</field><field name="subject">isopods</field><field name="subject">fisheries</field><field name="subject">baitsaver</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20090727.115745</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Why are the symbioses between some genotypes of Sinorhizobium and Medicago suboptimal for N2 fixation?</field><field name="creator">J.Terpolilli@murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">The conversion of atmospheric dinitrogen (N2) into plant available nitrogen (N), by legumes and their prokaryotic microsymbionts, is an integral component of sustainable farming. A key constraint to increasing the amount of N2 fixed in agricultural systems is the prevalence of symbioses which fix little or no N. The biotic factors leading to this suboptimal N2 fixation have not been extensively analysed. Using the widely studied and cultivated perennial legume Medicago sativa and the model indeterminate annual legume Medicago truncatula with the sequenced bacterial microsymbiont Sinorhizobium meliloti 1021 (Sm1021) as a basis, the work presented in this thesis examined the effectiveness of N2 fixation in these associations and in other comparable systems and investigated factors which lead to the establishment of suboptimally effective symbioses.

The ability of Sm1021, S. medicae WSM419 and the uncharacterised Sinorhizobium sp. WSM1022 to fix N with M. truncatula A17, M. sativa cv. Sceptre and a range of other Medicago spp. was evaluated in N-limited conditions. As measured by plant shoot dry weights and N-content, Sm1021 was partially effective with M. truncatula A17 whereas WSM1022 and WSM419 were both effective with this host in comparison to nitrogen-fed (N-fed) control plants. In contrast, Sm1021 and WSM1022 were effective with M. sativa while WSM419 was only partially effective. Nodules induced by Sm1021 on M. truncatula A17 were more numerous, paler, smaller in size and more widely distributed over the entire root system than in the two effective symbioses with this host. On the contrary, nodule number, size and distribution did not differ between these three strains on M. sativa. WSM1022 was effective on M. littoralis, M. tornata and two other cultivars of M. truncatula (Jemalong and Caliph) but Sm1021 was only partially effective on these hosts. These data indicate that the model indeterminate legume symbiosis between M. truncatula and Sm1021 is not optimally matched for N2 fixation and that Sm1021 possesses broader symbiotic deficiencies. In addition, the interaction of WSM1022 with M. polymorpha (small white nodules but does not fix N), M. murex (does not nodulate), M. arabica (partially effective N2 fixation) and M. sphaeorcarpus (partially effective N2 fixation), and the sequence of the 16S rDNA, are all consistent with this isolate belonging to the species S. meliloti.

The colony morphology of TY, half-LA and YMA agar plate cultures of Sm1021, WSM419 and WSM1022 suggested differences in EPS profiles between these strains. Sm1021 is very dry, compared to the mucoid WSM419 and extremely mucoid WSM1022. Sm1021 is known to carry an insertion in expR rendering the gene non-functional and resulting in the dry colony phenotype. WSM419 has an intact copy of expR, while the expR status of WSM1022 is not known. Rm8530, a spontaneous mucoid derivative of Sm1021 with an intact expR, was significantly less effective with M. truncatula than Sm1021, but there was no difference in effectiveness between these strains on M. sativa. The effectiveness of Sm1021, when complemented with a plasmid-borne copy of expR from Rm8530, was significantly reduced on M. truncatula but not M. sativa, implicating a functional expR as being the cause of reduced N2 fixation observed with Rm8530 on M. truncatula. ExpR could reduce the effectiveness of Rm8530 by acting as a negative regulator of genes essential for symbiosis with M. truncatula, or by altering the quantity or structure of succinoglycan and/or galactoglucan produced. These data support the emerging view of ExpR being a central regulator of numerous cellular processes.

The timing of nodulation between Sm1021 and WSM419 on M. truncatula and M. sativa was investigated. Compared to the other symbioses analysed, the appearance of nodule initials and nodules was delayed when M. truncatula was inoculated with Sm1021 by 3 and 4 days, respectively. To explore whether events during early symbiotic signalling exchange could account for these observed delays, leading to the establishment of a suboptimal N2-fixing symbiosis, a novel system was developed to compare the response of the Sm1021 transcriptome to roots and root exudates of M. truncatula A17 and M. sativa cv. Sceptre. This system consisted of a sealed 1 L polycarbonate chamber containing a stainless steel tripod with a wire mesh platform on which surface-sterilised seeds could be placed and allowed to germinate through the mesh, into a hydroponic medium below. After germination, Sm1021 cells were inoculated into the hydroponic solution, exposed to the roots and root exudates for 16 h, harvested and their RNA extracted. Comparison of Sm1021 mRNA from systems exposed to M. truncatula or M. sativa revealed marked differences in gene expression between the two. Compared to the no plant control, when M. sativa was the host plant, 23 up-regulated and 40 down-regulated Sm1021 genes were detected, while 28 up-regulated and 45 down-regulated genes were detected with M. truncatula as the host. Of these, 12 were up-regulated and 28 were down-regulated independent of whether M. truncatula or M. sativa was the host. Genes expressed differently when exposed to either M. truncatula or M. sativa included nex18, exoK, rpoE1 and a number of other genes coding for either hypothetical proteins or proteins with putative functions including electron transporters and ABC transporters. Characterisation of these differentially expressed genes along with a better understanding of the composition of M. truncatula root exudates would yield a clearer insight into the contribution of early signal exchange to N2 fixation.

Comparison of the regulation of nodule number between Sm1021 and WSM419 on M. truncatula and M. sativa revealed nodule initials at 42 days post-inoculation (dpi) on M. truncatula inoculated with Sm1021. In contrast, no new nodule initials were present 21 dpi on any of the other interactions examined. Moreover, analysis of nodule sections revealed that the number of infected cells in M. truncatula-Sm1021 nodules was less than for comparable symbioses. These data suggest that nodule number is not tightly controlled in the M. truncatula-Sm1021 association, probably due to N2 fixation being insufficient to trigger the down regulation of nodulation. Quantification of N2 fixation activity in this and other more effective symbioses is required. The poor effectiveness of the M. truncatula-Sm1021 symbiosis makes these organisms unsuitable as the model indeterminate interaction and the implications for legume research are discussed. The recently sequenced WSM419 strain, revealed here to fix N2 more effectively with M. truncatula than Sm1021, may be a better model microsymbiont, although WSM419 is only partially effective for N2 fixation with M. sativa. The sequencing of S. meliloti WSM1022, a highly effective strain with both M. truncatula and M. sativa, would provide a valuable resource in indentifying factors which preclude the establishment of effective symbioses.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Root Nodule Bacteria</field><field name="subject">Effectiveness</field><field name="subject">Model Legume</field><field name="subject">Medicago truncatula</field><field name="subject">Sinorhizobium meliloti</field><field name="subject">Sinorhizobium medicae</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20090727.143325</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Prevalence, risk factors and molecular epidemiology  of Brachyspira pilosicoli in humans and animals</field><field name="creator">R.Margawani@murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">The work described in this thesis was concerned with identifying the prevalence and risk factors associated with colonisation by the intestinal spirochaete Brachyspira pilosicoli in:

humans: long term residents of Perth, Western Australia (WA) and Indonesians either living temporarily in Perth or as long term residents in urban and rural areas of Bali, Indonesia, 

animals: domestic animals including alpacas, birds, cattle, cats, chickens, dogs, doves, ducks, goats, horses, pigs, and sheep (housed at a wide variety of places around Perth), and a range of wild animals housed in various Zoos and wildlife centres in WA.

This study shows that for humans:

&#149;	Brachyspira pilosicoli was significantly more prevalent in Indonesians of all sub groups, be they temporary residents of Perth (9.4% - 216 faecal samples from 180 individuals), or long term residents of Indonesia (12.6% - 992 faecal samples from 617 individuals) compared with long term residents of Australia living mainly in Perth (0.2% of 766 sampled), even in those with gastrointestinal complaints. This suggests a relationship between a high prevalence of B. pilosicoli and living in Indonesia;
&#149;	In Bali, B. pilosicoli was significantly more prevalent in the impoverished urban area of Sesetan (20.3-23.4%) where the husbandry of pigs is poor and effluent treatment is non-existent compared to four traditional farming villages (Badung, Karang Suwung, Melinggih, Payangan Desa) (3.3-22.6%). In the latter villages effluent and drainage is better and there is less likely to be contamination of drinking water
&#149;	There was no significant association between the presence of B. pilosicoli and the presence of clinical symptoms including headaches, abdominal pains, diarrhoea, joint/muscular pain and constipation.
&#149;	Amongst Indonesians living in Indonesia, there was no significant difference in the prevalence of B. pilosicoli between people with and without contact with animals and between farmers and other occupational groups.
&#149;	Indonesians visiting Perth who were positive for B. pilosicoli originated from nine cities and five main islands in Indonesia. This suggests that B. pilosicoli is endemic throughout Indonesia.
&#149;	Strain typing of isolates of B. pilosicoli showed that they were genetically heterogenous and did not show any consistent pattern with respect to geographical location, family of origin or disease status. Isolates from the same individual were sometimes unrelated, suggesting the probability of re-infection with another strain between the samplings.
&#149;	Some households (~7%) had more than one member positive for B. pilosicoli. Strain analysis suggested transmission between family members, and this could be due to either faecal-oral transmission, or from a common external source, such as contaminated water.
&#149;	B. pilosicoli was cultured from only 0.2% of Australians. This low prevalence may be a result of little or no exposure to B. pilosicoli due to good personal hygiene and environmental sanitation.
&#149;	B. pilosicoli strain H1b and H171 that were isolated from healthy Indonesians were able to colonise mice and day-old chickens, and induced clinical signs of pasty faeces in the latter. Histological sections showed mild typhlitis and typical end-on attachment of B. pilosicoli to the caecal epithelial mucosa of the chickens. This finding suggests that the human isolates had pathogenic potential.

This study showed that for animals investigated:

&#149;	Intestinal spirochaetes were cultured from 46.4% (13/28) of bilbies with 14.3% (4/28) positive for B. pilosicoli. Spirochaetes were also cultured from the faeces of two Western Barred bandicoots and one (1.2%) kangaroo.
&#149;	Intestinal spirochaetes were not isolated from any alpacas, cattle, goats, horses, pigs, and sheep but were detected in 40.5% of ducks, 14.3% of chickens, 14.9% of ostriches and 1.5% of cats. 
&#149;	Few pets that are commonly kept in households (dogs, cats and aviary birds) were colonised, suggesting that they are not an important focus of B. pilosicoli infection in Australia.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Brachyspira pilosicoli</field><field name="subject">risk factors</field><field name="subject">intestinal spirochaete</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20090806.103159</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The dissolution of gold colloids in aqueous thiosulfate solutions</field><field name="creator">seanzhang06@hotmail.com</field><field name="description">The kinetics of the dissolution of gold and silver colloids in ammoniacal thiosulfate solutions has been studied using oxygen, copper(II) or oxygenated copper(II) as oxidants at pH 9 - 11 and temperature 22oC to 48oC. The effects of the concentration of the main reagents such as copper(II), ammonia and thiosulfate as well as various background reagents have been investigated. Gold and silver colloids have characteristic absorption peaks at 530 nm and 620 nm respectively. Thus, the extent of gold or silver dissolution in different lixiviant systems was monitored using an ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometer. A comparison of the behaviour of gold colloids and powders has also been made. The beneficial or detrimental effects of silver colloid, and background reagents such as silver nitrate, and sodium salts of nitrate, carbonate, sulfite, sulfate, trithionate, tetrathionate anions have also been investigated.

Experimental results show that the relative rates and the extent of gold colloid dissolution at 25&#186;C in different lixiviant systems in a given time interval are in the order: oxygen-cyanide &gt; copper(II)-ammonia-thiosulfate &#8776; oxygen-copper(II)- ammonia-thiosulfate &gt; oxygen ammonia-thiosulfate &#8805; oxygen-ammonia &gt; copper(II) ammonia. The analysis of electrode potentials shows that Au(S2O3)23- is the predominant gold(I) species in the lixiviant solutions containing oxygen or copper(II) as oxidant and thiosulfate or mixed ammonia-thiosulfate as ligands. During the reaction of copper(II) with thiosulfate in ammoniacal solution without oxygen, the measured potential using a platinum electrode represent the redox couple Cu(NH3)n2+/Cu(S2O3)m1-2m (n = 4 or 3, m = 3 or 2) depending on the concentrations of thiosulfate and ammonia.

The initial dissolution rates of gold colloid by oxygen in copper-free solutions show a reaction order of 0.28 with respect to the concentration of dissolved oxygen, but independent of the concentration of ammonia and thiosulfate. The reaction activation energy of 25 kJ/mol in the temperature range 25&#176;C to 48&#176;C indicated a diffusion controlled reaction.

The initial dissolution rates of gold colloid by oxidation with copper(II) in oxygenfree solutions show reaction orders of 0.41, 0.49, 0.60, 0.15 and 0.20 with respect to the concentrations of copper(II), thiosulfate, ammonia, chloride and silver respectively. The presence of silve (I) or chloride ions enhances the rate of gold dissolution, indicating their involvement in the surface reaction, possibly by interfering with or preventing a passivating sulfur rich film on gold surface. An activation energy of 40-50 kJ/mol for the dissolution of gold by oxidation with copper(II) in the temperature range 22&#176;C to 48&#176;C suggests a mixed chemically/diffusion controlled reaction. The dissolution of gold by oxidation with copper(II) in oxygen-free solutions appears to be a result of the reaction between gold, thiosulfate ions and the mixed complex Cu(NH3)p(S2O3)0. The half order reactions support electrochemical mechanisms in some cases.

The initial dissolution rates of gold colloid, massive gold and gold-silver alloys by oxygenated copper(II) solutions also suggest a reaction that is first order with respect to copper(II) concentration. High oxygen concentration in solutions has a negative effect on the initial rate of gold dissolution and overall percentage of gold dissolution, indicating that oxygen affects the copper(II), copper(I) or sulfur species which in turn affects the gold dissolution. The surface reaction produces Au(NH3)(S2O3)- and Cu(NH3)p+. The mixed complexes Au(NH3)(S2O3)- and Cu(NH3)p+ re-equilibrate to the more stable complexes Au(S2O3)23- and Cu(S2O3)35- in solution.

The dissolution of gold powder by oxidation with copper(II) in oxygen-free solutions shows the same trends as that of gold colloid. The presence of silver(I) or chloride ions enhances the initial rate and percentage dissolution of gold colloid and powder. The dissolution kinetics of gold powder and colloid follow a shrinking sphere kinetic model in solutions of relatively low concentrations of thiosulfate and ammonia, with apparent rate constants being inversely proportional to particle radius.

The best system for dissolving gold based on the results of this work is the copper(II)-ammonia-thiosulfate solution in the absence of oxygen or in the presence of oxygen. In the absence of oxygen, copper(II) 1.5-4.5 mM, thiosulfate 20-50 mM, ammonia 120-300 mM and pH 9.3-10 are the best conditions. The presences of carbonate and sulfite have a significant negative effect on the dissolution of gold. The presence of sodium trithionate shows a beneficial effect in the first two hours, while sodium tetrathionate or lead nitrate have a small negative effect and sodium nitrate showed no effect on the dissolution of gold. Silver nitrate and sodium chloride also show beneficial effects. In the presence of oxygen, copper(II) 2.0-3.0 mM, thiosulfate 50 mM, ammonia 240 mM and pH 9.3-9.5 are the best conditions.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Dissolution</field><field name="subject">gold colloids</field><field name="subject">thiosulfate</field><field name="subject">leaching</field><field name="subject">ammonia</field><field name="subject">kinetics</field><field name="subject">copper(II)</field><field name="subject">oxygen</field><field name="subject">activation energy</field><field name="subject">silver.</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20090807.121135</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Getting to Know You: The Journey From Refugee to African-Australian.</field><field name="creator">nikmacd@gmail.com</field><field name="description">In this thesis I adopt a multi-disciplinary approach to explore the experiences of African humanitarian migrants in Australia.

These stories were collected through semi- and unstructured personal interviews over a period of two years. They emerge out of my evolving relationships with the participants, and highlight the importance of friendship and active listening in promoting positive cross-cultural interaction. 

The narrative accounts are supplemented and augmented by documentary chapters that examine the broader socio-political aspects of culture, war and refugees in Africa.  The fine detail of the individual experiences of flight, settlement and relationships converge with these contextual accounts to open a window on the social world of humanitarian migrants.

The study is designed to explore a faith-based community context in which a youth mentoring programme is being considered as a strategy to help develop adult-youth relationships and youth participation in the community.  The focus of this research is an Anglican parish in Perth, Western Australia.  The study evaluates whether mentoring would be the most appropriate adult-youth programme intervention to facilitate parish ministry to its young people.  

Three literatures related to formal adult-youth programmes including youth mentoring, intergenerational and youth-adult partnerships inform the study.  Key programme characteristics and theoretical models related to the three literatures are identified, as well as recommended practices or behaviours associated with the development of effective adult-youth relationships.
   
The study methodology emphasises wide consultation and elicits the perceptions and expectations of participants regarding youth mentoring and youth participation.  Illuminative evaluation, action research and mixed methods approaches are integrated and combined within the study, incorporating a range of data sources to be compared and contrasted to identify adult and youth needs and to produce recommendations pertinent to the parish context.  A sociocultural approach to data analysis and interpretation, as outlined by Barbara Rogoff, is employed to foreground interpersonal relationships in the parish whilst also considering individual and cultural-institutional planes of analysis.  
   
Youth participation is identified to be an adult need given the anxiety of many study participants about the future of the parish and their valuing of a community incorporating all age groups.  Despite generally positive participant expectations of mentoring as an intervention, study findings indicate that a formal youth-adult activity programme would be more likely to respond to the needs of all young people connected to the parish.  Mentoring is identified to be one potential form of youth-adult activity that could be included, as well as being a form of relationship that could develop naturally.  The study includes four main recommendations regarding preparatory activities intended to support the design and implementation of an effective parish adult-youth programme: (1) Address barriers to communication between youth and adults; (2) Be aware of power differences between adults and youth; (3) Be open to supporting youth initiated change; and (4) Develop a shared vision for youth participation in the parish.  Overall, lessons learned from the youth mentoring, intergenerational and adult-youth partnership literatures suggest that a focus on mutuality and reciprocity between youth and adults is most beneficial for the development of ongoing relationships.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Adult-Youth Relationships</field><field name="subject">Context</field><field name="subject">Youth Mentoring</field><field name="subject">Intergenerational Relationships</field><field name="subject">Adult-Youth Partnerships</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20090824.140806</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Attitudes toward Sexuality in the Book of Ben Sira</field><field name="creator">karib34@hotmail.com</field><field name="description">The fact that Ben Sira seemingly has a negative attitude towards women or femininity can easily lead to the assumption that the work has a negative attitude toward sexuality. However, this thesis will seek to demonstrate that the author's view on sexuality is complex, subtle, and depends on the context of the individual sayings. First of all we have to make a distinction between the attitudes of the writer of the original Hebrew text of the book and that of the Greek translator. The two texts, produced in different social settings, circumstances, times and places, differ substantially at times in regard to sexuality. Therefore it is essential to treat them separately and to compare them. In addition, the Book of Ben Sira, the longest Jewish wisdom book, is a complex combination of carefully composed wisdom poems that structure the whole work, and of teachings on everyday issues including marriage, family life, self-control, desires and passions, and sexual promiscuity. The openness about issues of eroticism that characterizes some of the poems concerning personified female wisdom is unprecedented in the wisdom writings of Second Temple Judaism. Similarly, the sage dedicates a greater number of passages than other wisdom books, to the discussion of social relations especially in regard to family. In so doing his regular point of departure seems to be what benefits or damages these relations mean, and whether they bring disgrace to a person, especially through sexuality. These all have bearings on the author&#146;s and translator&#146;s views of sexuality, including the position a person or situation under discussion might have in the sage&#146;s social value system. Therefore the thesis examines the wisdom poems, and all sayings that concern sexuality found in discussions of passions, relations with parents, daughters and sons, wives and husbands, and warnings against sexual wrongdoing, including prostitution and adultery.

Schooling has become one of the core, generalisable experiences of most young people in the Western world. This study examines the ways that students inhabit subjectivities in school through the normalising vision of the good student. The idea that schools exist to produce good students who become good citizens is one of the basic tenets of modernist educational philosophies that dominate the contemporary education world. 

This study takes a different position, arguing that the visions of the good student deployed in various ways in schools act to produce various ways of knowing the self that are ultimately concerned with behaviour and discipline rather than freer thought and action. Developing the postmodern theories of Foucault and Deleuze, this study argues that schools could be freer places than they are, but current practices act to teach students to know themselves in certain idealised ways through which they are located, and locate themselves, in hierarchical rationales of the good student.

Part of the promise of schools lies in the ways that students become negotiators and producers of their subjectivities, albeit in narrow and limiting ways. By pushing the ontological understandings of the self beyond the modernist philosophies that currently dominate schools and schooling, this study problematises the ways that young people are made subjects in schools. Part of this modernist tradition is found in the institutional tendency to see students as fixed, measurable identities (beings) rather than dynamic, evolving performances (becomings). 

Schools and schooling largely appear to make sense to us because we think we understand what happens and what should happen in schools. The good student is framed within these aspects of cultural understanding. However, this commonsense attitude is based on a hegemonic understanding of the good, rather than the good student as a contingent multiplicity that is produced by an infinite set of discourses and experiences. I argue that this understanding of subjectivities and power is crucial if schools are to meet the needs of a rapidly changing and challenging world.

This study utilises socially critical case study research across multiple sites to investigate those micropractices of power in schools that produce the normalising vision of the good student. Data from three school sites was gathered using a variety of techniques including interviews and focus group research.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sociology of education</field><field name="subject">philosophy of education</field><field name="subject">good student</field><field name="subject">Foucault and education</field><field name="subject">Deleuze and education</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20090831.142044</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Crime and punishment on the Western Front: the Australian Imperial Force and British Army discipline</field><field name="creator">jgarstang@bermudasun.bm</field><field name="description">The Australian Imperial Force in the First World War had a deserved reputation as an effective fighting force, and at the same had the worst disciplinary record away from the frontline when compared with other Dominion forces and the rest of the British Army. Australian indiscipline is a subject that has been largely ignored, or when dealt with as in the Official History by C. E. W. Bean, has had to pass through the filter of the Australian Legend. This study examines the link between Australian indiscipline and the privileged position they held of being the only force immune from the death penalty, except for mutiny, desertion to the enemy and traitorous activity. This simple fact would have a major influence on the relatively high numbers of absentees and desertions within Australian ranks. General Headquarters in France (GHQ) saw these high levels of indiscipline as a direct result of Australian authorities not allowing their soldiers to be placed under the Army Act in full. Further differences surfaced between the British and Australians when it came to punishment, with Australian courts criticised by British Army authorities for not using the powers they possessed to impose penalties that would act as a deterrent, as well as their reluctance to impose Field Punishment No. 1. This study examines these general differences as well as dealing with a specific case of an Australian soldier charged with the murder of a French civilian, a case that attracted the attention of senior political and military figures when it transpired Australians were immune from the death penalty for murder. Maintaining discipline was a constant struggle for the authorities when faced with those determined to avoid frontline duty either by committing military crime or through self-maiming. In this context the high venereal disease rate is discussed and evidence presented that this could be considered as a self-inflicted wound. The mutiny in the 1st Battalion of September 1918 is examined as well as a mutiny in a military prison in France in 1919. It is not the purpose of this study to tarnish the reputation of the many thousands of brave men who fought in the AIF, rather it is an attempt to understand the high levels of indiscipline within the context of the war on the Western Front and the disciplinary code under which they operated.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">AIF indiscipline</field><field name="subject">field punishment</field><field name="subject">Anzac Lengend</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20090831.143148</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The new spin: Effects of information control behaviours on source trustworthiness and persuasion</field><field name="creator">D.Hynd@murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">Given the high level of skepticism from the public toward politicians, this research explores the communication styles that separate public figures who are trusted and supported from those who are not. Contrary to conventional practice, it is argued that the use of &#145;spin&#146; in political communication is a large factor contributing to the public&#146;s negative perception of politicians. Political spin is defined as a communication style encompassing specific behaviours designed to appeal to the media, control information, and contain the meaning audiences derive from a message. This research operationalised spin as it is used in political communication and compared participants&#146; responses to messages with low and high levels of spin. The present research comprised three studies. In Study One, interviews were conducted with communication professionals to define the concept and specific &#145;information control behaviours&#146; associated with spin. An &#145;authenticity&#146; scale was then developed to measure audience responses to low and high-spin messages. In Study Two, 50 participants were randomly assigned to view a series of low or high-spin political messages. Participants rated messages from a confederate politician as well as actual politicians, government officials, and corporate representatives using the Authenticity Scale. Study Three was conducted throughout the 5-weeks of political campaigning prior to a general election. A representative sample of 60 voters was used each week in a repeated measures design to rate the political candidates and two confederate politicians using the Authenticity Scale. It was found that participants were able to clearly discern the degree of spin used by politicians when communicating a message. Messages containing a high level of spin elicited more negative attitudes and significantly lower levels of support for politicians, than messages containing a low level of spin. Specifically, participants&#146; perceptions of source trustworthiness and credibility were significantly higher for politicians using a low-spin style of communication. The findings are discussed in terms of the expectancy disconfirmation theory. The findings suggest that adopting a new low-spin style of communication will assist public figures to communicate more persuasively and to better engage an increasingly skeptical public.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20090831.143959</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Lines in the Sand: An Anthropological Discourse on Wildlife Tourism</field><field name="creator">Leah.Burns@griffith.edu.au</field><field name="description">The management of wildlife tourism has been dominated by ideologies informed by western colonialism and its values of nature. These ideologies, made transparent through communicative and interpretative discourses, influence the way management policies and practices are devised and enacted. The inherent scientific and utilitarian views are supported by a doctrine of separation. This is apparent in the dualism posed, and enacted, between nature and culture that sees humans as being the sole carriers of culture that separates them from the uncultured and uncivilised world of nature into which all other animals, and certainly untamed wildlife, belong. It justifies the use of non-humans for human purposes and continues to allow us to treat non-human animals and other forms of nature in often abominable ways.

This thesis investigates two situations in which wildlife tourism occurs in Australia. Fraser Island and Penguin Island are two wildlife tourism destinations on opposite sides of the continent with very different wildlife but some very similar issues. From these two contexts data was collected through interviews, focus groups, participant observation, and from literary and documentary sources. Understanding the empirical data collected from these case studies is facilitated through a social constructionist view of discourse analysis that allows an unpacking of the messages and a stance from which to challenge the dominant ideologies that frame management and interaction.

In the thesis I demonstrate that anthropology, in its incarnation as environmental anthropology and as a team player in a necessarily interdisciplinary approach to understanding and resolving environmental issues, has much to offer. This engagement has the potential to enhance not only the sustainable future of naturebased activities like wildlife tourism but also the relevance of anthropology in the postcolonial contemporary world.

The need for a holistic framework encompassing all the stakeholders in any wildlife tourism venture is proposed. This approach to wildlife tourism is best serviced by examining perspectives, values and concerns of all members of the wildlife tourism community at any given destination. It is only through this type of holistic and situated focus that we can hope to effectively understand, and then manage, in the best interests of all parties.

More specifically, and finally, I argue for a rethinking of the way wildlife tourism interactions are managed in some settings. The ideology of separation, enacted both conceptually and physically to create maintain boundaries, is demonstrated through the two case studies and the ways in which interactions between humans and wildlife are currently managed. An alternative is posed, that by reconstructing management in settings where wildlife tourists may be more accepting of their own responsibility towards nature, a model can be developed that allows people and wildlife to co-exist without &#145;killing&#146; the natural instincts of either.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Wildlife Tourism</field><field name="subject">Anthropology</field><field name="subject">Environmental Science</field><field name="subject">Fraser Island</field><field name="subject">Penguin Island</field><field name="subject">Social Constructionism</field><field name="subject">Dingoes</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20090831.145810</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Pain, motion sickness and migraine: effects on symptoms and scalp blood flow</field><field name="creator">a.granston@murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">Migraine, a neurovascular disorder, is associated with disturbances in brain stem activity during attacks.    Interictal persistence of these disturbances might increase vulnerability to recurrent attacks of migraine.   To explore this possibility, effects of motion sickness and pain on migrainous symptoms and extracranial vascular reponses were investigated in 27 migraine sufferers in the headache-free interval, and 23 healthy age/sex matched controls.  
 
Symptoms of migraine and motion sickness are remarkably similar.  As both maladies involve reflexes that relay in the brain stem, they most probably share the same neural circuitry.  Furthermore, migraineurs are usually susceptible to motion sickness and, conversely, motion sickness-prone individuals commonly experience migraine.   Participants in the present study were exposed to optokinetic stimulation (OKS), a well-established way of inducing symptoms of motion sickness in susceptible individuals.
   
Sensitivity to painful stimulation of the head and hand was also explored.  Head pain is a hallmark of a migraine attack and cutaneous allodynia has been observed elsewhere in the body during attacks.  The trigeminal nerve is associated with head pain in migraine, and trigeminal activity evokes reflexes that relay in the brain stem.  To stimulate the trigeminal nerve, ice was applied to the temple.  To stimulate nociceptors elsewhere in the body the participant immersed their fingers and palm in ice-water.

Procedures used in this study were physically stressful and probably psychologically stressful.    The impact of stress in relation to the development of symptomatic and vascular responses, particularly anticipatory stress-responses, was explored. 

This research involved one central experiment that consisted of six experimental conditions. On separate occasions participants were exposed to optokinetic stimulation and painful stimulation of the head or limb, individually and in combination.  

In migraine sufferers, symptomatic responses were enhanced during all procedures involving OKS and during temple pain after OKS, in the presence of residual motion sickness.  During trigeminal stimulation independent of OKS, headache initially developed followed by nausea as the procedure progressed.  In contrast, symptoms barely developed in controls during any of the six procedures except for slight dizziness, self-motion and visual-illusion during conditions involving OKS, and slight nausea when the temple was painfully stimulated during OKS and during OKS alone.  Trigeminal stimulation during OKS intensified nausea and headache in migraine sufferers compared to during OKS alone or limb pain during OKS.  However, the remaining symptomatic ratings were not affected by temple pain during OKS, suggesting a specific association between nausea and head pain.  It may be that these cardinal symptoms compound one another during a migraine attack.    Enhanced symptomatic responses in migraine sufferers during the headache interval may indicate activation of hypersensitive neural pathways that mediate symptoms of motion sickness or migraine.  Migraineurs found procedures generally more unpleasant, and ice-induced pain ratings more intense and unpleasant, than controls, which may further indicate hyperexcitable nociception in this group, or a difference in their criterion of discomfort.

Vascular responses, particularly during OKS alone, and during painful stimulation independent of OKS, were greater in migraine sufferers than in controls.   The added stress of painful stimulation during OKS appeared to boost facial blood flow in controls to approach levels obtained in migraine sufferers.   Enhanced vasodilatation was observed in migraineurs prior to painful stimulation, presumably due to anticipatory anxiety.  
           
For both groups ipsilateral vascular responses were greater than contralateral responses when the hand was painfully stimulated.    During limb pain before OKS asymmetry was minimal in migraine sufferers but more apparent in controls.  An enhanced stress response in migraineurs may have drawn ipsilateral and contralateral responses closer together.

The development of symptoms during the procedures of this study provides an insight into how symptoms might develop sequentially in a migraine attack.  Once the headache is in motion, nausea and headache may mutually exacerbate one another.  In turn, trigemino-vascular responses and stress appear to be associated with the migraine crisis.  Given the interactive nature of symptomatic, vascular, and stress responses, it may be more effective to target multiple, rather than individual, symptoms, in prophylactic or acute chemical and psychological interventions.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Migraine</field><field name="subject">motion sickness</field><field name="subject">pain</field><field name="subject">nociception</field><field name="subject">blood flow</field><field name="subject">vasodilatation</field><field name="subject">headache</field><field name="subject">nausea</field><field name="subject">trigeminal nerve</field><field name="subject">brain stem</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20090831.155228</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Impacts of Amending Bauxite Residue Sands with Residue Fines for the Establishment of Vegetation on Residue Disposal Areas</field><field name="creator">j.anderson@murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">Long term storage of bauxite residue materials requires a capping stratum which will limit erosion while stabilizing slopes, limit deep infiltration of water into storage piles, and be aesthetically acceptable to the surrounding community. A diverse native vegetative community capable of surviving seasonal drought, low plant available water and nutrient constraints has the best potential of satisfying most, if not all of these requirements. Current and past rehabilitation of residue disposal areas (RDAs) using species native to southwest Western Australia has exhibited varying success. Current practices at Alcoa World Alumina Australia&#146;s (Alcoa) Western Australia refineries have bauxite residue fines (&lt; 150 &#236;m) stored within impoundments, in which the outer embankments are constructed with bauxite residue sands (&gt; 150 &#236;m). The residue sands are also used as the growth media in the capping stratum for vegetation establishment on the disposal sites. Despite the inherently hostile properties of residue sand (pH &gt; 10, EC(1:5) &gt; 4 dS m-1, and ESP &gt; 50), reductions in alkalinity (pH), salinity (EC) and sodicity (ESP) are corrected, through freshwater leaching, to a greater extent than is possible with residue fines. Although leaching can reduce the hostile character of residue sand, additions of phosphogypsum are typically added to expedite the removal of Na and alkalinity, and inorganic fertilizers are incorporated to improve the nutrient status of the growth media. However, due to the inconsistencies in vegetation establishment, which are attributed to poor water retention, inherent nutrient deficiencies and rapid loss of nutrients within residue sands (because of high hydraulic conductivity), further amendments are required. 

The aim of this study was to determine if amending the residue sand capping layer with residue fines would enhance its overall growth potential for vegetation establishment. Additions of fines to residue sands were predicted to increase water retention, add nutrients and increase the ability of the growth media to retain nutrients.  Comparisons were made between the treated residue fines (seawater washed, carbonated, or unaltered) at a series of fines additions (1 - 20 % w/w) and a control(residue sand) amended with 2% (w/w) phosphogypsum and inorganic fertilizer. 

Comparisons were to determine the differences in 1) water retention, 2) nutrient concentrations and nutrient retention, and 3) plant growth responses and plant biomass nutrient concentrations between the growth media treatments. Four experiments were set up to measure differences in these variables which included: a glasshouse study involving the growth of Acacia saligna; a germination and emergence study (A.saligna); a two year field study in Western Australia; and a glasshouse column leaching study. 

Water retention increased with increasing percentage of residue fines addition. Plant available water (PAW) increased up to 110 %, with a 20 % increase in fines, representing an increase of 0.026 m3 PAW m-3 residue growth media, when compared to the residue sand only. This increase in PAW was attributed to changes in pore space distributions, due to the increasing fines contents altering the sandy texture to loamy sand texture class. However, initially much of this increase in PAW may not be realized, due to estimated temporary increases in osmotic potential associated with the high salt contents of residue sand and fines. Fines materials have much greater salt contents, and thus need to be leached to a greater extent than sands to remove the associated osmotic potential effects. 

Essential plant nutrients (P, K, S, Ca, Mg, and B) were increased with additions of residue fines in the glasshouse studies, although many nutrients (Mg, Zn, Mn and B) were still marginal for sustainable plant growth and development. Seawater treated residue fines additions produced the greatest increases in growth media nutrients with substantial increases in soluble (&gt; 7 mg L-1) and exchangeable (&gt; 0.10 cmolc kg-1) Mg, being up to 400 % greater than all other treatments. Along with these necessary nutrients, concentrations of Na were also increased in all fines additions treatments. Added Na may offset the benefits of fines additions, at least in the short term, due to inhibitions of cation uptake from Na competition. However, in the column leaching study soluble and exchangeable Na was lost rapidly from the profile, due to Ca and K displacement of Na from exchange sites during leaching. Soluble Na was removed from the profile to &lt; 5 % of initial concentrations, after only three pore volumes of leaching, and exchangeable Na was removed from charge sites to less than 25 % of the initial concentration. Fines additions did increase concentrations of Mg and K on exchange sites, thus reflecting increased nutrient retention capacity relative to that in residue sand only. 

Plant growth responses and plant biomass nutrient concentrations were altered with the additions of residue fines to residue sands. The germination and emergence study demonstrated that the emergence of native seedlings was affected by additions of fines, due to the increased salinity and sodicity of the materials. Acacia saligna seedling emergence was inhibited by EC(1:5) &gt; 2 dS m-1, which was highly correlated with a Na/Ca ratio of &gt; 40, for all treatments, except the seawater fines additions. Seeds sown in seawater treatments emerged from growth media with EC(1:5) as high as 3.33 dS m-1 and appeared to be better correlated with Ca/Mg ratios than any other variable. Native vegetation growth responses showed mixed results in fines treated residues in the field. In the greenhouse study, plant growth tended to decrease with fines additions. Poor plant growth with increasing fines additions occurred despite the increased water retention and increased nutrients. This was attributed to the addition of Na associated with the residue fines, as increases in Na, EC and ESP in fines treatments all appear to have limited growth of Acacia saligna in the glasshouse over three months. Seawater fines additions had elevated Mg and B concentrations in plant biomass, and performed better than the carbonated or unaltered fines treatments, but still had reduced growth compared to the residue sand, which contained lower Na concentrations. Additional plant growth limitations may have occurred, due to possible plant nutrient deficiencies including: Mg, Zn, Mn and B and Na toxicity. 

Incorporation of residue fines into residue sands did increase water retention, nutrient concentrations and the nutrient retention capacity, but did not enhance the overall growth potential for vegetation, at least in the short term. Reductions in germination and emergence of seedlings and reduced plant growth were attributed to increases in Na concentrations introduced from the fines. Seawater washed residue fines had lower ESP and greater concentrations of nutrients, thus reducing the negative impacts from the additional Na introduced, and showed the greatest promise as a fines amendment. As leaching occurs over the first few initial months of rehabilitation, it is expected that the majority of the Na will be removed, from a system with an addition of 5 to 10 % fines, and the positive benefits of the fines additions will than be realized. Findings also illustrate that delaying the planting of vegetation on RDAs, until adequate leaching has occurred to reduce the Na concentrations, will substantially increase vegetation emergence and establishment.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bauxite residue</field><field name="subject">red mud</field><field name="subject">water retention</field><field name="subject">Western Australia</field><field name="subject">plant nutrients</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20090831.155453</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A.O. Neville, the 'destiny of the race', and race thinking in the 1930s</field><field name="creator">alan.charlton@audit.wa.gov.au</field><field name="description">The notion of 'race' was central to the thinking about and administration of Aboriginal affairs in the 1930s, but its meaning was fluid. In many respects Auber Octavius Neville, senior bureaucrat in Western Australia from 1915-1940 and a national figure in Aboriginal affairs during that period, was emblematic of the race thinking of the period. This study looks at the Western Australian Moseley Royal Commission of 1934, the Western Australian Parliamentary debates and legislation of 1929 and 1936, the Canberra Conference of Commonwealth and State Aboriginal Authorities in 1937, and Neville's 1947 book, Australia's Coloured Minority - for their exemplification of race thinking. Basic incompatibilities and inconsistencies, as evidenced in Neville's thinking and action across his career, were common in the period. Neville's central administrative desire was to force biological absorption to its ultimate conclusion - the 'Destiny' of Aborigines of the part descent was to be absorbed biologically into the white community. He used scientific support to 'prove' the 'safety' of this strategy. The central premise of Neville's race thinking, however, was that some form of racial essentialism would always negatively impact upon the 'absorption' of Aborigines into white Australia. Other major figures differed with Neville over the suitability of absorption, notably Queensland Chief Protector, J. W. Bleakley, but still believed in some essential 'Aboriginal-ness'. The thesis also traces Neville's attempts to dominate Aboriginal affairs both in the construction of the 'problem' and in proclaiming solutions. Neville was absolutely certain that his solution was the only way forward. This certainty, when added to the inconsistent notions of race that informed his conceptualisation of the 'problem', produced policies and practices of insurmountable internal contradictions that have profoundly affected generations of Aborigines.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">race</field><field name="subject">racism</field><field name="subject">indigenous Australians</field><field name="subject">Aboriginal Australians</field><field name="subject">Government Policy</field><field name="subject">Neville</field><field name="subject">A.O.

In particular, how they plan for survival and growth.As such, the main objective of the action oriented research project is to assess the viability of developing a framework which will be capable of providing structured, useful and relevant  guidance to micro to small-sized enterprises (MSEs) in terms of business survival and growth. In a practical sense, it is important that the framework is also flexible enough to deal with the complexity and fluidity of the real life business environment within which MSEs operate.A review of current growth theory and the current available data and tools aimed at assisting MSE in the area of growth planning is presented in chapter two. This review serves to highlight two important issues which, in turn, guide the research project.- Firstly, an attempted review of current statistical information regarding MSEs highlighted a serious lack of general planning data for this sector within Europe. (Statistics are only analysed and reported for companies with over 20 employees)- Secondly, extant literature regarding growth theories for MSEs, fails to provide one perfect solution. There is a general consensus that it is neither possible, nor desirable, to try to develop one single and fixed model to predict company growth.Chapter two also provides a review of associated disciplines which are closely related to MSE planning ie entrepreneurship, innovation, and complexity. This extended review shows that flexibility and adaptiveness have a great impact on business decisions regarding company survival and growth and further strengthen the case for a flexible solution. Through consideration of these related topics the following three concepts are brought to the fore and are subsequently integrated into the final response to the research questions: - inherent company leadership,- the influence of the external environment and the opportunities and threats it presents to a MSE, - the internal factors which impact MSE company operations and decisionsAs such, Chapter two highlights the need for a bespoke solution which is both reactive and conditional. In order to focus the project, several delimitations were introduced.- Geographically, the research was based upon the prevailing conditions for German and central European MSEs.- Furthermore, a single case study company was selected as it suited the participative requirements of the project. The company is a micro-sized offset printing house.- As the project advanced, it became clear that decisions regarding company survival and growth for MSEs varied greatly depending upon the stage of operations in which the company found itself. Thus, a more specific focus on mature MSEs was adopted as the project and research progressed. By placing these three restrictions on the research project it was possible to conduct meaningful action-oriented research, aimed at generating future action and change  beyond the study, as well as identify and address a very specific set of research problems, namely:Main problem:How can managers of mature micro to small-sized offset printing plants in German/central Europe plan for survival and grow into the future?Sub problems:a. Can a management decision tool be developed to assist this decision and growth process in the mature company?b. How would such a tool be formulated to ensure both effectiveness and acceptance? (what factors should it consider)The key concepts introduced via the extant literature were then integrated into a soft systems review, supported by action-oriented research, in an effort to develop a flexible framework aimed at addressing the research problems.Several phases of research serve to support and build upon, or refine, one another to establish a more relevant and meaningful solution. A preliminary research phase comprising a Delphi study and convergent interviews was supported by group feedback sessions conducted with a small work group from the case study company &#8211; Werbedruck Petzold. The work group reviewed aspects of the developing framework at various stages throughout the project; each time participants were able to refine concepts and enhance the response to the main research problem. Chapters three, four and five present this conceptual development and testing/evaluation process. They also highlight the robustness of the data stemming from repetitive cycles and triangulation techniques integrated into the research design. The ultimate contribution to knowledge which evolved from the action-oriented research is presented in the form of a three-step framework which acknowledges - the overriding and inherent wishes of the MSE&#8217;s owner/manager - the opportunities and threats posed by the external environment, and- the mix of functions each MSE must develop to meet its own specific goals, given its own environmental situation. It is important to note that the response to the research problem is not a fixed model which can be systematically applied to all MSEs. But is rather a flexible framework which is intended to be actioned by MSEs, given their own situations and goals. The key to the proposed framework is that it must be continually reviewed to reflect the &#8216;current reality&#8217; of a MSE. It is basically a framework which has been developed via action oriented research techniques and is intended for ongoing case-specific, action, review, and refinement. It represents a shift in growth theory for MSEs as it embraces and promotes contingency, thus better reflecting the reality of MSEs.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">micro-small enterprises &#8211; Germany</field><field name="subject">small business &#8211; Germany</field><field name="subject">action-oriented research</field><field name="subject">small business - research</field><field name="subject">Business Administration, Management, and Operations</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/33</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The development of a plastic scintillator for radiotherapy dosimetry</field><field name="creator">Morales, Johnny Estuardo</field><field name="description">A plastic scintillator detector was developed and tested in a 6MV photon beam.

An analysis was performed using the Gamma Evaluation method and the agreement was acceptable for a criterion of Distance To Agreement = 2 mm and Dose Difference = 2%.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/105</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Synthesis, characterisation and application of inherently conducting polymer nanoparticles</field><field name="creator">Ngamna, Orawan</field><field name="description">Synthesis of inherently conducting polymers (ICPs) nanoparticles is an option to improve the processability and conductivity of ICPs. In this thesis, the synthesis and application of ICPs nanoparticles has been demonstrated. Various polymerisation methods, such as emulsion polymerisation, use of steric stabiliser and synthesis in ionic liquid (IL) media, have been used to synthesise polymer nanoparticles. These synthesis methods render the ICPs nanoparticles stable as dispersions which are more processable and contain peculiar and fascinating properties superior to their bulk counterparts. These nanoparticles are further applied as mediators for biosensors. They have been fabricated into sensors using electrodeposition, evaporative casting, or ink-jet printing methods. Electrodeposition method results in formation of ultra thin nanostructured polymeric films that enhance sensor performance. Evaporative casting method is an easy one-step method, but precision is hard to achieve and dense films with rough morphology are formed. Ink-jet printing can be used to produce precise and accurate patterns and also this approach is amenable to mass production.Polyaniline (PANI) nanoparticles; nanoPANI-dodecylbenzene sulphonic acid (DBSA) have been synthesised using emulsion polymerisation (Chapter 3). The nanoPANI-DBSA obtained has a conductivity of 34&#177;7 S/cm with particle size in the range of 10&#177;2 nm. The nanoPANI-DBSA has been used as a mediator layer in biosensor applications as demonstrated in Chapter 7. These nanoparticles were fabricated onto the conductive electrode using an electrodeposition method with subsequent immobilisation of the enzyme horseradish peroxidase (HRP). Sensor performance was examined using amperometric method and HRP/hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) configuration as a model system. The nanodomain of the nanoPANI-DBSA particles contributed to highly ordered nanostructure patterning on the electrode surface. This uniform surface showed improved enzyme deposition characteristics, a lower background signal and better sensor performance at a lower HRP loading when compared to the sensors fabricated from electropolymerisation of the bulk monomer.NanoPANI-DBSA particles aggregate at high concentrations; hence they are not amenable to ink-jet printing. sPANI-DBSA was prepared from centrifugation of the nanoPANI-DBSA dispersions and used as a material for ink-jet printing. HRP was premixed with the sPANI-DBSA nanodispersions before fabrication onto ITO-coated mylar using ink-jet printing. The print quality from the sPANI-DBSA nanodispersions was inconsistent and the catalytic signal of this biosensor was very low. These resulted in no further ink-jet printing work for this material.The PANI-DBSA-rapid mixing (RM) nanodispersions were synthesised using a RM method. These dispersions contained nanometre size PANI particles dispersed in aqueous media. These nanoparticles have been successfully printed using ink-jet printing as outline in Chapter 9. This work has demonstrated the ink-jet printability of conducting polymer nanoparticles and their use as working electrodes for biosensors. The sensor response from these ink-jet printed PANI-DBSA-RM was higher than the sensor response from evaporative casting of poly(2-methoxyaniline-5-sulphonic acid) (PMAS) in Chapter 8.The addition of functional group into PANI nanoparticles was also investigated. Carbolan Blue (CB) dye was incorporated into the PANI backbone using emulsion polymerisation method as demonstrated in Chapter 4. The dye was proved to have strong interaction with PANI backbone using Raman spectroscopy and centrifugation test. The distinct solution colour after a reduction process could lead the PANI-DBSA-CB to be a potential candidate of the material for electrochromic devices.Synthesis of polypyrrole (PPy) nanoparticles is demonstrated in Chapter 5. Poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) was used as the steric stabiliser to produce PPy-DS-PVA nanoparticles. These nanoparticles were well dispersed in water with particle size in the order of 52&#177;5 nm. Aggregation was obvious in concentrated solutions and leaded to poor ink-jet printed quality of the PPy-DS-PVA nanoparticles. The water soluble polymer, PMAS, was also used to fabricate biosensors using evaporative casting method in Chapter 8 and ink-jet printing in Chapter 9. In chapter 8, its solubility enabled PMAS to pre-mix with the HRP enzyme prior to complexing with the polycations poly(L-lysine) hydrochloride (PLL) and subsequently casting onto ITO coated mylar substrate. This biosensor format has proven ability to easily fabricate the conducting polymer nanoparticles by one-step evaporative casting. The optimised sensors exhibited good sensor response, high selectivity and very good long-term stability. The ink-jet printed films from PMAS and PLL solutions (Chapter 9) showed better electroactivity compared to the evaporative cast films which could lead to better sensor performance. However, the problem of PLL blocking the print head resulted in the discontinuation of its use.The polyterthiophene (PTTh) aqueous dispersed nanoparticles were also successfully synthesised in the presence of surfactant (DBSA) and in ionic liquid; 1-ethyl- 3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethane-sulfonyl)amide (emiTFSA) as demonstrated in Chapter 6. The dispersion of PTTh-DBSA nanoparticles has shown poor colloidal stability and poor electroactivity. Although the PTTh nanoparticles synthesised in emiTFSA needed 2-3 minutes sonication to be dispersed in water, they have shown good electrochemistry and being test in another study in our laboratories for its use in photovoltaic devices.These processable ICPs nanoparticles are promising materials for biosensor applications, electrochromic devices and solar cells. Assembly of these nanoparticles on to conductive substrates leads to highly ordered nanostructured ICPs on the surface and improves the biosensor performances. Also these nanoparticles prove their ability to be processable in mass production scale.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/767</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Adaptive reorganization of database structures through dynamic vertical partitioning of relational tables</field><field name="creator">Zhenjie, Liu</field><field name="description">Performance tuning of relational database systems is always a challenging task for database administrator. Automated performance tuning has been proposed recently as a new approach to detect and to eliminate performance problems and to support the decisions of database administrators.   This work considers one of the techniques used in automated performance tuning, dynamic vertical partitioning. Dynamic vertical partitioning of relational tables is one of the ways in which the physical structures of a relational database can be reorganized automatically in order to improve the performance of future database applications. The thesis presents how dynamic vertical partitioning can be used for the comprehensive analysis and optimisation of an adaptive reorganisation of database structures. In particular, we propose the algorithms to use to predict the future workload of the system, to analyse the characteristics of the workload, and to &#175;nd a near optimal vertical partitioning of relational tables. Then, we discuss the implementation aspects of vertical partitioning with the materialized view and index-based techniques.   Our contributions to automated performance tuning of relational database systems can be summarised as follows: 1. Propose a cost model to perform a detailed analysis of the costs of query and data manipulation processing over a given configuration of a relational database; 2. Propose a new algorithm for vertical partitioning of relational schemas in a data-base system with a given level of redundancies for a given workload; 3. Discuss the limitations of static vertical partitioning and propose dynamical vertical partitioning; 4. Discuss the characteristics of workload in order to predict the future workloads of the system; 5. Implementation aspects of vertical partition discussion: materialized view based and index based; 6. Discussion of the implementation of a vertical partition as a virtual view; 7. Conduct experiments to confirm the correctness of the cost model used by the vertical partitioning algorithm and demonstrate the expected performance gains from the partitioning</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/33</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effect of welding parameters on levels of diffusible hydrogen in weld metal deposited using gas shielded rutile flux cored wires</field><field name="creator">Pitrun, Miroslav</field><field name="description">Hydrogen assisted cold cracking (HACC) represents a significant threat to the integrity of welded steel constructions. HACC occurs at near ambient or lower temperatures and may be delayed for several hours, or even days, after welding is completed. Significant advances in developing thermomechanically controlled processed steels, with reduced carbon and alloy content, resulted in steels that are more resistant to HACC in the heat affected zone (HAZ). This has enabled the use of lower preheat temperatures during fabrication of welded structures. However, the improvement in the resistance of the HAZ to HACC has shifted the problem of cold cracking to the weld metal. The objective of this current work was to establish the effect of flux cored arc welding(FCAW) welding parameters, such as welding current, contact-tip toworkpiece distance (CTWD) and shielding gas type, on diffusible hydrogen (HD) content for single run, bead-onplate welds using low strength seamed and seamless gas shielded rutile wires of E71 T-1 classification. The work has shown that under most conditions investigated, the weld metal HD levels for the seamed rutile wire were above the 10 ml/100g specified by the consumable&#8217;s classification (H10). The measured range of diffusible hydrogen for the H10 wire was 8.3 to 17.0 ml/100g, with the highest hydrogen content being obtained at the lowest welding current of 280 A, shortest CTWD of 15 mm and deposited using 75Ar-25CO2 shielding gas. In contrast, the seamless wire met requirements of the H5 classification (HD &#8804;5 ml/100g) for all welding conditions investigated, with a range of HD levels of 0.9 to 3.5 ml/100g. In general, lower HD levels were achieved when using CO2 shielding gas, although the effect is less significant with the H5 seamless rutile wire. The work included an investigation of arc characteristics under typical welding conditions, using high speed digital imaging and laser backlighting, in order to provide information on metal transfer and arc length. Several tests were carried out using the H10 consumable. It was established that the amount of heat generated by resistive heating of the wire prior to melting can exert a strong influence on the weld metal HD content and is more pronounced in welds deposited using 75Ar-25CO2. The measured arc length was reduced significantly when welding under CO2 shielding gas. Despite suggestions in the literature there was no evidence of a change in metal transfer mode to spray transfer on increasing the welding current from 280 to 320 A, transfer mode was globular for all conditions used. Following the weld metal diffusible hydrogen testing and welding arc imaging work, the weld metal susceptibility to cold cracking was assessed using the gapped bead-on-plate (G-BOP) test at different preheat temperatures. For this part of the work, identical welding parameters those used for the diffusible hydrogen testing were selected. It was found that the H5 wire weld deposits did not reveal any cracking at ambient temperature, whereas all the welds deposited using the H10 wire exhibited cold cracking with no preheat. Weld metal deposited using 75Ar-25CO2 shielding gas resulted in higher susceptibility to cold cracking than with CO2, which correlated to lower HD levels the CO2 tests. Besides the higher hydrogen content, it was also found that higher weld metal hardness corresponded to the greater crack susceptibility in the welds deposited using 75Ar-25CO2 shielding gas. These factors are considered to contribute to higher susceptibility to transverse cold cracking compared with CO2 shielding gas. Although the overall results indicate that the weld metal susceptibility to cold cracking corresponds to the relevant levels of HD, this relationship was found to be ambiguous in welds deposited at the shortest CTWD of 15 mm, using CO2 shielding gas at all welding currents investigated. While the amount of diffusible hydrogen was marginally increased from 11.7 to 12.8 ml/100g, resulting from the welding current increase from 280 to 320 A, the amount of cold cracking at room temperature was significantly decreased from 89 to 25 %RTC. This is explained by a significant difference in the cross section of the weld beads, suggesting a need to more closely evaluate the G-BOP testing, particularly examining the effects of weld bead profiles on the weld susceptibility to HACC. Preheat was found to decrease the amount of cold cracking in the H10 welds and it was concluded that preheat significantly reduces the main contributor to decrease the HD in the weld metal. Although the cracking susceptibility of welds using 75Ar-25CO2 shielding gas decreased more slowly with an increasing preheat temperature, compare to those deposited using CO2, no cracking was observed at 120 &#176;C in welds under both shielding gases. This indicates that the same welding consumable (H10) deposited using different shielding gases can result in a different response to preheat temperature. Based on the results of this work, a number of changes are proposed to hydrogen testing standards AS 3752-1996 and ISO 3690-2000, particularly with respect to the effects of CTWD and shielding gases on levels of diffusible hydrogen in weld metal deposited using gas shielded rutile flux-cored wire.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/361</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Orthogonal designs and complementary sequences: constructions and applications for wireless communication</field><field name="creator">Zhao, Ying</field><field name="description">Problems concerned with the algebraic structure and existence of orthogonal designs and complementary sequences with zero aperiodic autocorrelation have long been of interest in combinatorics, coding theory and applied statistics. Over the last few decades, due to an increased demand for wireless services, new technologies have had to be considered since traditional methods are reaching their technical or  financial limits. This has motivated the study of new applications of algebraic structures for wireless communications to improve system performance. For example, space-time block codes (STB Cs) from orthogonal designs for multiple-input multiple-output (M IM O) wireless systems have received a lot of attention due to their inherent orthogonality, which guarantees a full transmit diversity and a simple linear decoding. The objective of this research is to investigate the construction of orthogonal designs and complementary sequences in terms of wireless communication applications. One thread of this thesis is the introduction of amicable orthogonal designs over the real and quaternion domain in the context of STB Cs from orthogonal designs. Another part is the study of Golay complementary sequences and their applications as orthogonal spreading sequences for direct sequence code division multiple access (D S-CD M A) systems. We address the following problems in this thesis: &#178; The current complex orthogonal STB Cs for more than two antennas are not delay optimal or full rate, and even contain many z eros, which will impede their practical implementation. We first introduce some new complex orthogonal codes of order eight with fewer wasted time slots compared to conventional codes. Furthermore, for those complex STB Cs constructed from amicable orthogonal designs containing z eros and irrational numbers in their coefficient matrices, we use the representation theory of Cliord algebras to improve the form of complex orthogonal STB Cs. B y applying this proposed method, we can construct square, maximum rate complex codes with less z eros and no irrational numbers, e.g. transmitted symbols are equally dispersed through transmit antennas. &#178; However, given any arbitrary order and type, many amicable orthogonal designs are left undecided, since they cannot be constructed using current techniques. We thus introduce the concept of orthogonal designs equivalence. By searching all the equivalence classes of orthogonal designs we find new amicable orthogonal designs of order eight. In addition, some undecided cases can be concluded with non-existence after searching all the equivalence classes of an orthogonal design with the same order and type. We then summarize all the existence and non-existence results of amicable orthogonal designs with order eight. &#178; Motivated by the success of space-time block codes from orthogonal designs, we also discuss the construction of amicable orthogonal designs over the quaternion domain (AOD Q ) for their possible applications as space-time-polarization block codes, since the additional polarization diversity can be modelled by means of quaternions. We construct some new AOD Q s using the Kronecker product with real amicable orthogonal designs or real weighing matrices from an amicable family. &#178; Complementary pairs and orthogonal spreading sequences constructed on the basis of complementary sequences have long been studied for channel separation in D S-CD M A systems. H owever, it is hard to generate sequences with both good autocorrelation and cross-correlation properties so as to achieve a good interference performance. We derive a new class of quadri-phase orthogonal spreading sequences from small mutually orthogonal (M O) complementary sets. We then apply a sequence modification method based on choosing a diag- onal H -equivalent matrix to optimize the correlation properties of sequences. The modifed sequences exhibit a reasonable compromise between autocorrela- tion and cross-correlation characteristics, and, as shown through simulations, lead to good performance when used in an asynchronous multi-user CD M A system.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/19</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies on the biomass, diversity and nutrient relationships of macroalgae and seagrasses in Lake Illawarra, New South Wales, Australia</field><field name="creator">Rutten, Karin</field><field name="description">Lake Illawarra is a shallow barrier lagoon, located on the south-eastern coast of Australia. Eutrophication, referring to the enrichment of water by inorganic plant nutrients (primarily nitrogen and phosphorus), is one of the key environmental problems in Lake Illawarra. Management of macroalgae in Lake Illawarra is a major issue; excessive blooms of macroalgae, resulting in odours, access problems and community concern over Lake health, have led to many management strategies, including direct harvesting of algal biomass. Little information is available on the factors responsible for excessive growth of macroalgae in Lake Illawarra, although over supply of nutrients has often been cited as the primary cause. The aim of this study was to investigate the distribution, diversity, biomass and nutrient relationships of seagrasses and macroalgae in Lake Illawarra, and to determine what contribution, if any, macrophytes make to the Lake&#8217;s nutrient budget.  Firstly, detailed species lists and taxonomic descriptions were prepared for macrophytes occurring in Lake Illawarra, between June 2000 and July 2003. This study focused primarily on shallow (&lt; 1 m depth), inshore areas of Lake Illawarra, where problematic macroalgal blooms frequently occur. Seagrasses found in Lake Illawarra are Zostera capricorni, Ruppia megacarpa, Halophila ovalis and Halophila decipiens. In addition, 35 species of macroalgae were recorded and described; these included: 14 species from 7 genera of green macroalgae; 9 species from 9 different genera of brown macroalgae; and, 8 species from 8 genera of red macroalgae.  The biomass of seagrasses and macroalgae in Lake Illawarra were documented seasonally (winter and summer) at four key Lake Illawarra sites; these included two R. megacarpa sites and two Z. capricorni sites. Average R. megacarpa and Z. capricorni dry weight (DW) biomasses (above and below-ground material) ranged from 54.8 - 440 g DW m 2 and 58.1 - 230 g DW m 2, respectively. Significant die-back, particularly of Z. capricorni, occurred in winter; summer biomasses were up to 1.5 - 3.9 times higher than winter biomasses. Below-ground material (roots and rhizomes) comprised 20 - 45 % and 40 - 67 % of total plant biomass for R. megacarpa and Z. capricorni, respectively. Macroalgal biomass in 2000-03 was notably lower than in previous decades; this may be due to drought, as well as improvements in water quality. Maximum biomasses of macroalgae recorded in the present study were 150 - 370 g DW m 2. Algal blooms were composed primarily of the filamentous chlorophytes, Chaetomorpha linum and Chaetomorpha billardierii. The highest seagrass (R. megacarpa) and macroalgal biomasses usually occurred at the Oasis Caravan Park site, located along the eastern Lake Illawarra peninsula.  Tissue nutrient analyses were conducted on the most abundant seagrasses (Z. capricorni and R. megacarpa) and macroalgae occurring at four sites in Lake Illawarra, between spring 2000 and winter 2002. Total C contents of macrophytes varied from 23.3 - 42.0 % C for seagrasses, and 28.0 - 39.7 % C for macroalgae. The &#948;13C and &#948;15N contents of seagrasses ranged from -7.7 to  15.9 &#8240; and 0.7 - 9.0 &#8240;, respectively. The most significant seasonal variations in seagrass &#948;13C contents and, to a lesser extent&#61472;&#948;15N contents, occurred in Z. capricorni located at the source of fresh water input, Mullet Creek. Macroalgae showed a greater variation in isotopic signatures than the seagrasses, ranging from  4.9 to  19.8 &#8240; (&#948;13C) and 1.8 - 14.6 &#8240; (&#948;15N). Differences between species at the same site were often more significant than differences between the same species at different sites. Seagrass leaf N and P contents ranged from 1.74 - 4.13 % (mean &#177; s.e.: 2.62 &#177; 0.05 % N) and 0.12 - 0.59 % P (mean &#177; s.e.: 0.31 &#177; 0.01 % P); leaf N and P contents were typically double those of roots/rhizomes. N contents varied between species and sites, but P contents of Z. capricorni were usually significantly higher than R. megacarpa. Z. capricorni C and N contents increased in winter, corresponding to lower winter biomasses. Seagrass leaf biomass and tissue P contents peaked in summer 2002, which may be related to higher water column P concentrations in summer. Tissue N and P contents of macroalgae were more variable than those of the seagrasses, and ranged from 0.85 - 3.95 % N and 0.03 - 0.58 % P. The average C/P (808 &#177; 65) and N/P (47.9 &#177; 3.47) molar ratios of macroalgae were typically double those of the seagrasses. Low concentrations of tissue P, with respect to N, in R. megacarpa and macroalgae implied P limitation on several occasions, particularly when macrophyte biomasses were low. High tissue N contents in Lake Illawarra macrophytes suggested N limitation of biomass formation rarely occurred. Evidence of P, rather than N, limitation in macrophytes is surprising considering most data suggests N limitation of phytoplankton production in Lake Illawarra. The estimated pools of N and P contained in Lake Illawarra macrophyte biomass were similar to those present in the water column, but appeared minute when compared to the N and P stored within Lake Illawarra sediment.  Laboratory culture experiments were conducted to evaluate the response of the most problematic alga, Chaetomorpha linum, to nutrient enrichment. Water temperatures of 20 - 25&#176;C were found to promote the highest growth rates (up to 27 % WW d 1) of C. linum, but high growth rates (13 % WW d 1) were also recorded at 10&#176;C, the lowest winter water temperature recorded in Lake Illawarra. Enrichment with N, rather than P, had the greatest effect on C. linum; growth rates were significantly reduced in treatments without added N, but treatments with N-alone were statistically similar to N+P treatments. It was concluded that in Lake Illawarra, C. linum was strongly nitrogen limited. The ability of C. linum to grow successfully in culture, under a range of nutrient treatments, and without added phosphorus, in particular, correlates with the excessive growth of this alga in Lake Illawarra.  This study has made a significant contribution to the understanding of seagrass and macroalgal growth, biomass and distribution in Lake Illawarra. This information will assist with the long-term management of macroalgal problems in Lake Illawarra.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/22</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Creating unity within an album for compositions defined as "jazz style"</field><field name="creator">Goyer, Edward</field><field name="description">Unity is an important factor when I compose music as it creates a sense of logic elements upon which the language of music can be communicated to the listeners. By the term &#8216;listener&#8217; I am referring to anyone, novice or educated, who listens to my music. Without the logic of unity, communication breaks down and the language of music consisting of both emotional and structural elements is no longer experienced by the listener. As part of my compositional approach, I have developed a set of rules that would allow unity to be created throughout the pieces to be recorded on the album. During the compositional process, it occurred to me that the largest unifying factor between all my compositions is that they were all written in &#8220;jazz fusion style&#8221;. If I was to consider style as a unifying feature, I needed to come up with a definition for what I believe qualifies my compositions as having been stylistically composed and performed as jazz, a major part of which, is the process of interplay and interaction between members of the ensemble. All the compositions on the album were recorded live with no multi-tracking or overdubbing. Using a live recording creates the maximum amount of interaction and interplay amongst the ensemble members necessary for my definition of jazz style in my compositions. It is my aim that the listener should be able to experience unifying factors between my compositions in some form while listening to the recording provided. They should also be able to recognize elements of interaction and interplay between ensemble members creating a sense of jazz style throughout my compositions.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/769</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An exploration of the psychosocial effects that school-age children with Child Absence Epilepsy (CAE) experience their condition is misdiagnosed as Atention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)</field><field name="creator">Raffaele, Martin</field><field name="description">Masters of Philosophy</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Child Absence Epilepsy (CAE)</field><field name="subject">Misdiagnosis</field><field name="subject">Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/5390</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Australian Citizenship: a genealogy tracing the descent of discourse 1946 - 2007.</field><field name="creator">Briggs, Justin</field><field name="description">This thesis is a genealogy which traces changes to the discourse of Australian citizenship. These changes were traced in the Australia Day (i.e., January 26) and January 27 editions of The Sydney Morning Herald (SMH) and The Sun Herald (SH) from 1946 &#8211; 2007. The dissertation used Foucault&#8217;s (1980; 1991a; 1991d; 1991e; 1998; 2002a; 2006b) genealogy supplemented with his archaeological method to provide an analysis of the discourse of Australian citizenship. The analysis was conducted by creating an archive of newspaper texts that related to Australian citizenship discourse. This archive represents the body of knowledge about citizenship as published in the specified print media and reflects the systems of thought that circulated the discourse at particular points in time. The archived newspaper texts related to Australian citizenship discourse contain traces of the social, political, cultural and economic beliefs and values of Australian citizens. The analysed texts were found in headlines, reports, editorials, opinion pieces, annotated photographs and letters to the editor that made-up the day-to-day history of the Australia Day editions. The texts that were produced in this narration in the SMH have provided data in the form of specific language use that defines the discourse of citizenship over the 62 year period. The language of these texts as reported in the print media represents the understandings of citizenship at particular times and also the discursive responses to contingent factors conditioning citizenship discourse including globalisation, localisation and neo-liberalism. The research links with Foucault&#8217;s (1980; 1991a; 1991d; 1991e; 1998; 2002a; 2006b) findings that the analysis of discourse is fundamental for understanding the nature of reality. This reality reported in this dissertation indicates a discourse that has changed and transformed over the analysed period of time. The discourse of citizenship has developed through the flow of rules and regulations that prohibit and permit what can and cannot be said, thought or spoken about citizenship at particular points in time. This form of normative thought, action and speech is culturally constructed and has been traced in the discourse through a mapping of specific language use related to understandings of citizenship. These types of knowledge constructions are artefacts of culture and reinforce existing power relations. This study has attempted to unmask these relations of power to question the rationality of the practices and experiences of Australian citizenship. The genealogical method allows for the distillation of citizenship discourse as a history of social and political truths as seen in the print media from 1946 &#8211; 2007. The genealogy of Australian citizenship presented in this dissertation lays bare the characteristic forms of power/knowledge manifested in the discourse over the post-World War Two period of Australian history to show systems of thought pertaining to citizenship. By doing so it shows that current citizenship practices are not the result of historical inevitabilities but rather the result of the interplay of contingencies. By emphasising citizenship in this way the thesis offers insights into how it can be refashioned to offer greater individual freedom through an understanding of the games of truth that are played throughout all levels of society. The manifestation of power/knowledge in the discourse is further evidence that citizens exist in relations of power. These manifestations produced five distinct thematic discursivities. I labelled them as, &#8216;The silencing of Aboriginal concerns 1946 &#8211; 1969, Authorised voices question the acceptance of poverty and racism 1969 &#8211; 1980, Relations of power between Aboriginal Australians and whites 1981 &#8211; 1988, Relations of power between Asian immigrants and whites 1989 &#8211; 1996, The struggle of cultural dominations 1997 &#8211; 2007&#8217;. In particular, a discontinuity was identified during the period Relations of power between Aboriginal Australians and whites 1981 &#8211; 1988. From this time in the discourse Indigenous Australians were permitted to criticise their treatment by whites. Subsequently this permission has become embedded in systems of thought. This thesis gives details of the products of the genealogical method related to the discourse of citizenship. It pinpoints the moments when individuals and social, cultural, economic and political groups played roles in the production, reproduction and transmission of truth from 1946 - 2007. Based on the products of the research it creates recommendations for minimising the potential dominations of social and political truths. It also suggests ways to re-think Australian citizenship to afford greater freedoms for individual thought, speech and action.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australia Day.</field><field name="subject">Australia.</field><field name="subject">Aboriginal Australians.</field><field name="subject">Social values.</field><field name="subject">Citizenship.</field><field name="subject">National characteristics, Australian.</field><field name="subject">Genealogy.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/882</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The multi-attribute elimination by aspects (MEBA) model.</field><field name="creator">Pihlens, David A.</field><field name="description">Our research proposes a new, multi-attribute, parameterisation of Tversky&#8217;s Elimination- By-Aspects (EBA) model.

However, the EBA model has seen limited usage due to the large number of required parameters given the set of items under study. For a set of items T, it has 2|T| - 3 free parameters, which is infeasible for all but the simplest of contexts. To provide a practical operationalisation, we impose a set of a priori constraints on the parameter space. We define a generic multi-attribute structure to the set of aspects. This restricts the cardinality of the set of unknown scale values while retaining the functional (recursive) form of the model. The EBA hypothesis of a population of lexicographic decision-makers can therefore be tested in more market-realistic contexts, and inferences made over a large universal set of items described by the complete factorial. We call this model the Multi-attribute Elimination-By-Aspects (MEBA) model. The MEBA model reduces the set of unknown free parameters to a maximum of |T|-1. We develop a general algebraic expression for the MEBA choice probabilities as a function of the attributes of the options in the choice set. This enables the derivation of a likelihood function, and consequently maximum likelihood estimation. We also consider the form of optimal MEBA paired comparison designs. Using Monte Carlo simulation and a discrete choice experiment with consumers, we conduct an initial empirical test of the model against the special case of the MNL model (that assumes no context effects) and find the MEBA model to be a better approximation of observed choice behaviour. This is achieved on a common set of parameters, and so it is due solely to the difference in functional form of the two models. We conclude with a discussion on future research directions, in particular the introduction of heterogeneity into the model, and the description of optimal choice experiments for larger choice set sizes.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Choice modelling.</field><field name="subject">Decision making.</field><field name="subject">Multiattribute decisions.</field><field name="subject">Consumers' preferences.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/884</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Habitat requirements and habitat use of the red-crowned toadlet Pseudophryne Australis and the giant burrowing frog Heleioporus Australiacus in the Sydney basin.</field><field name="creator">Andrew G, Stauber</field><field name="description">Habitat requirements and habitat use for Pseudophryne australis and Heleioporus australiacus were investigated to aid management of these threatened frogs around Sydney, Australia. Much of the work focussed on roads, commonly encountered features in the habitat of both species. The habitat requirements based on locality records of both frogs in the Sydney Basin were investigated at four spatial scales. Both species are habitat specialists. They showed a strong geological association with Hawkesbury Sandstone and occupy upper topographic areas with ephemeral watercourses of gentle gradients. Both frogs occur predominantly in areas of higher precipitation and milder temperature regimes compared to averages representative of the region. Leaf litter is an important feature of P. australis breeding sites, whereas H australiacus generally associate with crayfish burrows. Both species are dependent on natural vegetation with a complex structure. H australiacus have a relatively long larval period (3 - 12 months) and breed in ephemeral pools, exposing their tadpoles to the risk of dying due to early pond drying. In the laboratory, tadpoles responded to decreasing water levels by shortening their larval periods and metamorphosing earlier than siblings held at constant water level. Despite this plastic response, a number of pools in the field failed to produce metamorphs due to early drying, an observation also made on P. australis. Regular monitoring of breeding sites revealed increased reproductive success away from roads for both species probably because of relatively longer hydroperiods. Spatial distributions and associations with habitat features, and movement patterns of both frogs were further investigated using mark-recapture methods. Both species showed strong site fidelity. P. australis formed small aggregations and predominantly selected leaf litter piles despite their relatively low availability. Leaf litter piles in creeks moved over time and the animals moved with these piles. In contrast, H australiacus individuals formed no aggregations and showed no preference for any available structural vegetation type. Locations of individuals were independent of relative distances to creeks and artificial drains, but males appeared to be more common near culverts. However, individuals were randomly distributed in space and nearest-neighbour distances were high relative to individual movement distances, suggesting minimal overlap between relatively large home ranges. Radio-telemetry demonstrated that some H australiacus individuals burrow in the road environment. There they would be at risk of being dug up and possibly injured during road works. The results are discussed in relation to the spatial requirements of both species and the protection of utilised habitat features. Management options are suggested to mitigate the impacts of road works. Differences in spatial dynamics of both frogs with overlapping habitats highlighted in this study require species-specific management approaches.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Toads.</field><field name="subject">Heleioporus Australiacus.</field><field name="subject">Pseudophryne Australis.</field><field name="subject">Endangered species.</field><field name="subject">Frogs.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/890</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Transforming the Categories of Western Theology: A critical comparison between the political theology of Johannes Baptist Metz and the feminist theological hermeneutics of Elisabeth Schussler Fiorenza</field><field name="creator">Tuohy, Anne Patricia</field><field name="description">This thesis explores the transformative potential of theological categories within Western Christianity. In particular, this thesis explores the categories of memory, narrative and solidarity and their relationship to the broader categories of history; language; and community. The relationships between these categories are engaged by way of critically comparing and contrasting the political theology of Johannes Baptist Metz and the feminist theological hermeneutics of Elisabeth Schussler Fiorenza. This thesis traces the roots of these categories from the political theology of Johannes Baptist Metz and critically explores how the feminist theological hermeneutics of Schussler Fiorenza both uses and develops them. This exploration reveals the debt feminist theologies owe to political theology for the critical and emancipatory articulation of memory, narrative and solidarity. It also reveals important connections between memory, narrative and solidarity and the broader categories of history, language and community. Accordingly, this thesis explores the implications of a feminist engagement with the relationships between: history and memory; language and narrative; community and solidarity. By way of an intensification of the particular a critical feminist perspective more clearly extends the theological potential of these relationships and so illuminates their importance in a vitally -- and even radically -- new way. In the work of Elisabeth Schussler Fiorenza this extension is most clearly expressed through her critique of the kyriarchal socio-religious structures of Western culture and society which she grounds by way of a particular focus the church as the ekklesia of women. Accordingly, this thesis is divided into six chapters. Chapter One positions feminist theologies within the broader tradition of Western culture and society. Chapter Two briefly traces the historical, philosophical and theological heritage of political and feminist theologies as theologies of social critique. Chapter Three examines the contemporary historical consciousness of Western society and deals with the concerns feminist theologies have with Western history. In understanding history as both the liberative and oppressive story of human agency this chapter explores the use of memory as a tool for the emancipation of Christian history. In Chapter Four we look at the formative power of language as the medium through which humanity understands existence and reality. By way of a feminist critique, this chapter explores how language can operate to both facilitate and inhibit the liberative stories of the Christian tradition. Chapter Five examines the basic vision and structure of community. Here, the conditions that help foster women's solidarity and contribute to the nurturing of authentic relationships and vital Christian communities are explored. Chapter Six reviews Elisabeth Schussler Fiorenza's contribution to the transformative potential of the theological categories of memory, narrative and solidarity and offers two general critiques for further discussion. Chapter Six then concludes this thesis by engaging both Metz and Schussler Fiorenza in a critical-rhetorical reading of their work.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Theology</field><field name="subject">Political theology</field><field name="subject">Feminist theology</field><field name="subject">Johannes Baptist Metz</field><field name="subject">Elisabeth Schussler Fiorenza</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp219.10092009</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of home ranges, movement and activity patterns of Great Spotted Kiwi (Ateryx haastii) in the Hurunui Region, South Island, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Keye, Constanze</field><field name="description">All kiwi species (Apteryx spp.) have suffered serious decline since human arrival and are nowa-days threatened on the New Zealand mainland. One of the most elusive, and as a result least known among the different kiwi species, is the great spotted kiwi (Apteryx haastii). Hence, little is known about the current status of the remaining great spotted kiwi populations or their popu-lation dynamics. Three main &#8216;natural&#8217; populations are found in Northwest Nelson, the Paparoa Range and in the Arthur&#8217;s Pass Hurunui district. In 2007, the Department of Conservation started a great spotted kiwi population dynamics study in the North Branch of the Hurunui, the area where this research project was conducted. Kiwi workers of the Department of Conserva-tion (Waimakariri area office) captured and VHF radio-tagged 11 kiwi between March and July 2007 in the North Branch and started to collect radio tracking and activity data. To improve this existing data set, 10 of the 11 birds were intensely radio tracked using triangulation and homing techniques during December 2007 to April 2008 for this Master&#8217;s research project. Estimated home-range sizes for great spotted kiwi in the North Branch varied between 19.59 ha and 35.41 ha, with a calculated mean of 29.3 ha for adult birds. The kiwi population in a defined research area of 60 km&#178; in the Hurunui North Branch was estimated to be around 290 birds. The density for the whole area monitored by the Department of Conservation in the North Branch was esti-mated to be 2.25 pairs per km&#178; plus subadults or in other terms 4.83 birds per km&#178;. These density estimates are much higher than results of earlier studies in the Arthurs Pass/Hurunui district. Movement plots of three bonded pairs showed that partners stayed in territories they shared. Nevertheless pairs shared only in 5% of days (n=38) shelters but regularly met during night and kept in contact via calls especially prior to meetings. Nightly travel distances varied between 488-1657 m. Furthermore, the most frequent travel distances covered per hour ranged between 50-150 m. The results of this study provide information for other kiwi researchers and raise ad-ditional questions for other projects regarding great spotted kiwi biology, behaviour and dynam-ics still need to be answered (e.g. habitat requirements). Finally, the results of this study alone are poor indicators of current population health, but they do provide a scientific baseline for any subsequent population monitoring for the great spotted kiwi population status and health in the North Branch area. If future monitoring shows that the great spotted kiwi population is at risk, suitable management actions can be applied and their success can be correctly evaluated.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Great spotted kiwi</field><field name="subject">Apteryx haastii</field><field name="subject">Hurunui River</field><field name="subject">home range</field><field name="subject">movement</field><field name="subject">population density</field><field name="subject">activity</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/1195</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sharing leadership in schools : narratives of discourse and power : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Education at Massey University</field><field name="creator">Court, Marian</field><field name="description">This thesis explores the phenomenon of shared leadership as it emerged in three primary schools in Aotearoa/New Zealand, during the 1990s restructuring of educational administration. At this time, two 'mainstream' discourses of professional collaborative leadership and neo-liberal managerialism came into 'collision.' The principal's role was re-constituted from being a collaborative instructional leader, to being a chief executive, entrepreneurial manager. Separate contracts for principals and senior school managers detailed managerial tasks, performance standards and accountability lines that heightened the existing divisions between them and other teachers. The possibility of developing 'flattened,' more democratic forms of shared decision making- and leadership seemed increasingly remote. Yet it was in this context that a small number of co-principalships were initiated around the country. The study employs narrative, Foucauldian and feminist poststructuralist discourse analysis tools to examine how opportunities for change opened up within 'cracks' and contradictions in the 1990s discursive terrain of educational leadership. Moving between micro and macro analyses, the thesis demonstrates how individual and collective agency is enacted within and against dominant discourses, effecting transformations of practice. Three groups of women challenged and/or co-opted elements of managerial, professional and feminist discourses of organisation as they developed their co-principalships. These initiatives opened up for many people different ways of thinking about and practising school leadership: as one child said about her school, "Here there is no boss." Three case narratives provide insights into strategies for developing more fully democratic partnerships between principals and staff, principals and board members, professionals and parents. Open, honest communication and mutual forms of accountability that go beyond current requirements for contractual, task specific and linear forms of control, are particularly significant for a successful co-principalship. Governmental forms of power, material inequalities and socio-cultural hegemonies of gender, class and ethnicity, can constrain the democratic potential of shared leaderships however. Related factors that led to the disestablishment of two or the co-principalships included inequalities of knowledge and experience, difficulties over funding and staffing, and struggles between a governing body and their co-principals over the meanings and practices of governance and management. There are flaws in arguments that posit a generic model of 'strong' management that can be imposed across all schools, with assumed uniform results. This study shows how people's beliefs about and practices of school leadership are constituted in relation to their own backgrounds, interactions with other people in their local school community and wider socio-political, economic and discursive struggles over power.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Elementary school principals</field><field name="subject">Case studies</field><field name="subject">Women school principals</field><field name="subject">Educational leadership</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education::330100 Education Studies::330199 Education studies not elsewhere classified</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/989</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterization of arsenic resistant bacteria and a novel gene cluster in 'Bacillus' sp.

Having frequently witnessed and been intrigued by the idiosyncratic intricacies of literacy learning in my teaching and parenting, I was drawn towards theorists and educators who recognise literacy as a complex social practice. As classroom teacher and researcher, I set out with the broad aim of exploring sociocultural factors influencing the literacy development of students in the class I was teaching at the time. Using a qualitative research paradigm, data collection began at the beginning of the school year and proceeded until the end of the final term. Data collection techniques included participant observation, field notes, video and audio recordings, questionnaires, structured and unstructured interviews and artefact collection. Initial analysis examined the data to identify factors that appeared to influence literacy development. As analysis proceeded, I became aware of intertextual incidents in the data. Intertextuality was first defined by Kristeva (1967) and describes the process of interpreting one text by means of a previously composed text. The presence of intertextual events in this study and the implications they have for literacy teaching and learning, precipitated the eventual focus for the study, namely, intertextuality. An exploration of the theory of intertextuality, its significance to literacy, analysis of intertextuality in this classroom data and the implications for literacy teaching in the kindergarten classroom became the central focus of the study. The study involved transcribing the intertextual incidents from the data and categorising them across three domains. The research has led to significant theoretical progress in understanding intertextuality and amongst other things has suggested a framework for describing intertextual incidents The final stage of the study also involved drawing together four themes from the literature on intertextuality with transcript examples from the kindergarten study. This conclusive paper indicates the application of independent critical ability in synthesising the new data with the complex body of literature surrounding intertextuality.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">literacy</field><field name="subject">study and teaching</field><field name="subject">intertextuality</field><field name="subject">language arts</field><field name="subject">kindergarten</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/15507</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Leading educational change for a preferred future : a gender inclusive approach to building school leadership effectiveness, capacity and capability through learning</field><field name="creator">Brennan, Kathryn E.</field><field name="description">This portfolio presents a research continuum spanning the period of the author&#8217;s Ed.D. candidature (1998&#8211;2004) addressing the questions, What capabilities contribute to effective school leadership; Why do so few women become school principals and what strategies can be employed that will redress the current gender imbalance among school leaders?

Of these high schools, 98 are specialised in some way &#8211; selective, performing arts, sports, technology, senior and multi campus (Vinson, 2002, p. 126). Over one quarter of schools are now specialised in some way, leaving just under 300 comprehensive high schools. Of these, 30 are single sex.

The specific focus of the research is to examine how NSW government secondary schools came to be where they are today. Change in secondary schools from both the systemic and school level is examined.

The thesis proposes an innovative analytical model for music theatre/multi-media with a distinctive perspective. Adapting concepts from feminist Deleuzean theorists, it advances a notion of feminine difference that moves beyond earlier debates between essentialists and anti-essentialists. This theoretical framework guides the close examination of three works &#8213; Andr&#233;e Greenwell&#8217;s Laquiem: Tales from the Mourning of the Lac Women (1999), Greenwell&#8217;s Laquiem (2002) and Gretchen Miller&#8217;s Inland (1999/2000) &#8213; that complicate the category &#8216;music theatre&#8217; in the way that they cross genre boundaries. Greenwell&#8217;s Laquiem: Tales from the Mourning of the Lac Women is a new music performance work based upon Kathleen Mary Fallon&#8217;s &#8216;The Mourning of the Lac Women&#8217;. This work has a close relationship to Laquiem (2002), a short film directed, composed and scripted adapted by Greenwell based upon the same text by Fallon. Inland is a radiophonic work that Miller also staged as a live performance. The thesis argues that changing format and interdisciplinary content of works such as these has contributed to the current proliferation of genre labels. Recent works can be defined under various descriptors such as &#8216;performance art&#8217;, &#8216;documentary opera&#8217; or &#8216;installation performance&#8217;. The thesis offers the concept of &#8216;deterritorialised music theatre&#8217; to address works that exist at and beyond the limits of music theatre as a category. The penultimate chapter applies a Deleuzean feminist framework to the composition portfolio submitted with the thesis.

Yet, the magnitude and timing of nitrate fluxes during winter convection is poorly understood due to an absence of targeted process studies. In the northwest NASG, multiple quasi-Lagrangian studies were conducted during the boreal winters of 2004 and 2005 in an effort to sample strong winter convection. During each of the time-series studies, inventories of vertically fluxed nitrate were quantified approximately every twelve hours using the distribution of helium isotopes ([delta]&#65533;He) and nitrate in the water column. This method is known as the Helium Flux Gauge Technique (HFGT).
Large variability in surface forcing and density structure of the upper ocean was observed between the two years; however, only winter 2005 experienced convective mixing to depths greater than 150 m. In winter 2004, mild atmospheric conditions coincided with a positive phase in the winter North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), consistent with the dominant regime experienced during the previous decade. On average 36 &#65533; 9 mmol m[-2] of fluxed nitrate was inferred by excess &#65533;He in the mixed layer of the ocean during the winter 2004 study period. This inventory of physically transported nitrate is attributed to the sampling of waters laterally advected from nearby eddy features. The sampling of multiple water masses is likely due to the inability of the drogue to persistently follow water masses efficiently. Although physical evidence indicates spatial variability within the time-series data, the length scales of convective mixing appear to be greater than those associated with spatial aliasing as a result of drogue performance. This observation provides us with increased confidence that the objectives for the present study are not compromised by spatial variability in the data.
In contrast, winter 2005 experienced a negative NAO, strong physical forcing and convective mixing to depths &gt; 250 m. Two convectively modified water masses, most likely resulting from a single storm event, were sampled at different stages of development. These two water masses exhibit large variability in the magnitude of nitrate entrained in the convective layer from the thermocline. An average inventory of 247 &#65533; 56 mmol NO&#8323;[-]m[-2] was entrained in the rapidly expanding convective layer of the first water mass in the first few days following the storm approach. In contrast, ongoing entrainment of nitrate was absent from the second water mass, sampled two weeks later when the depth of the surface mixed layer was consistently ~ 300 m. These results indicate that surrounding fluid is entrained into the convective layer when it is actively expanding in the vertical. On the other hand, significant fluid entrainment does not occur at the base of the plume once sinking waters have reached a level of neutral buoyancy. The persistence of elevated nitrate stocks (~ 100 mmol m[-2]) in the convective layer two to three weeks after the inferred injection event, suggests sub-optimal nitrate uptake by resident phytoplankton. Phytoplankton growth was most likely resource limited by light or a micronutrient such as iron. Despite the implied biolimitation, changes in chlorophyll-a, a proxy for phytoplankton biomass, indicate net production within the convective layer. On average, the convective layer was observed to support an inventory of 62 &#65533; 6mg chlorophyll-a m[-2], increasing at an average rate of 3.4mg m[-2] d[-1]. This inventory indicates a slow build-up of phytoplankton biomass to near bloom levels, ahead of the main spring bloom that typically follows formation of the seasonal thermocline near Bermuda. Net production in the convective layer was likely due to transient periods of increased (weak) surface stability that were observed to support high phytoplankton biomass, following the cessation of thermocline fluid entrainment.
When nitrate and excess &#65533;He in samples collected from the thermocline were regressed for the purpose of quantifying nitrate fluxes, the results showed that between 1.6 - 2.0 [mu]mol kg[-1] of dissolved nitrate was present during formation of the water mass. This suggests the source of this excess (above Redfield ratios) nitrate in the thermocline of the NASG is not local, and has ramifications for local nitrogen fixation budgets determined using geochemical approaches.

These organic ligands play significant roles in bacterial metabolism: solubilising iron (III) from environments, enabling iron uptake and acting as a cell-signalling molecule to control gene expression. Recent observations of initial stages of Pseudomonas aeriginosa biofilm formation on metal oxides surfaces indicate that siderophores may also facilitate bacterial adhesion to metals. However, details of how siderophores interact with metal surfaces and the relationship of their chemical nature with bacterial adhesion were not fully understood. To test the generality of bacteria attachment to metals via siderophores, the adsorption behaviour of siderophores and their functional ligands groups on particle films of metal oxides were investigated with in-situ ATR-IR spectroscopy.
In this study, nanoparticle films of titanium oxide, boehmite, iron oxide and chromium oxyhydroxide were prepared as substrates to simulate titanium, alumnium, stainless steel surface and more detailed work were carried out on titanium dioxide. Monohydroxamic acids (acetohydroxamic acid, N-methylformohydroxamic acid, N-methyl-acetohydroxamic acid and 1-hydroxy, 2-piperidone) and catechol and catechol-like (L-dopa and esculetin) ligands were selected as modelling compounds for the most frequently occured functional groups in natural siderophores. IR spectra of these ligands in aqueous solution and adsorbed on TiO&#8322; were obtained with a flowing cell system fit to a horizontal accessory by in situ ATR-IR spectroscopy and interpreted based on vibrational mode analysis with density function theory. Results show that all these ligands can form surface complexes with metal surfaces and possible adsorption modes of these molecules were discussed. The pH dependence of absorbance of IR absorption of these adsorbed ligands showed that most of the ligands exhibited maximium adsorption to TiO&#8322; at about pH 8, only N-methylformohydroxamic acid, 1-hydroxy, 2-piperidone groups having maximum absorption at pH~3 and pH~6.
Infrared spectroscopic studies of adsorbed siderophores (desferroximme B, enterobactin and pyoverdine) were also carried out in variation of concentration and pH. Possible adsorption modes of these iron scavenger ligands on TiO&#8322; and other metal oxides were discussed. Results showed that all these ligands adsorbed on metal oxide surfaces and form surface complex via hydroxamate or catecholate lignd groups which confirm the generality of siderphore-metal bond formation.

However, as a result of globalisation and the deregulation of the New Zealand economy, SMEs in this country have been faced with the need to internationalise in order to grow because of increased domestic competition. Moreover, when they make their move to offshore markets they also face fierce competition. Hence, it is in this largely integrated and competitive global marketplace that it becomes critical for smaller firms to learn about international business to succeed. Therefore, this thesis aimed to understand and explain how internationalising NZ SMEs learn and develop knowledge throughout their internationalisation process.
To frame this problem an extensive review of the literature on internationalisation, organisational knowledge and organisational learning was conducted. This assessment revealed a gap related to the evolution of learning and knowledge in SMEs' internationalisation process. It also identified the incremental and born-global internationalisation types, two more common and distinctive internationalisation paths that SMEs follow. The literature described the several common forms of knowledge that played more or less critical roles in these firms' internationalisation. Furthermore, extant research also stated that experiential learning and other learning processes were important for the internationalisation of these firms but it did not delve into the development of these learning processes over time. Finally, the evaluation of the knowledge and learning literatures identified three most distinctive and important forms of knowledge that organisations develop as a result of several learning processes.
Anchored on the research problem and the specific research questions, derived from the literature review, and framed by a post-positivist worldview, this study developed a methodology that combined theory building, process-based research and case studies to address the problem. More specifically, the methodology involved the selection of and collection of historical, or retrospective, data from eight cases, four incremental and four early-internationalising firms. The data collected through interviews and document analysis was examined using different process analysis techniques.
This research has found that there were important differences in the incremental and early-internationalising firms' learning and knowledge during their creation. Furthermore, the early-internationalising firms identified and implemented an internationalisation strategy from the beginning. Thus, the knowledge about international markets and products acquired through congenital learning and their initial intention to offer their products offshore allowed the early-internationalising firms to expand internationally from their creation or soon after. In contrast, the incremental firms only decided to internationalise after they learned from their experience in their domestic market that they had a successful product that had international potential. Besides their initial internationalisation strategy, or lack of it, and knowledge, other factors, such as firm resources, product and industry characteristics and previous learning and knowledge, influenced these firms' subsequent internationalisation strategy, learning and knowledge.

The outcomes of this market-oriented approach of universities are: First, students are increasingly seen as customers of knowledge by universities, and universities as suppliers of knowledge to these customers (Svensson &amp; Wood ,2007). Second, students are being faced with an array of education choices and information (passively or actively gained). As with physical product consumption, the institution brand with its underlying appeals can function as a route map for students through this bewildering variety of choices/information.
Despite the plethora of studies on education purchase, the impact of brands on students' choice of international tertiary education provider has not been fully explored. This is especially so within the context of brand image and brand trust. The purchase of an international tertiary education can be a risky (uncertain) venture because of the time and cost involved. Consumer's trust in a brand contributes to a reduction of uncertainty in consumer purchases (Garbarino &amp; Mark 1999). However, the concept of brand trust is not explored in education. While the research on brand image within the context of education is not new, its definition and measurement varied or seldom explore in relation to country-of-origin, promotion channel and individual values in student's choice decisions. This thesis aims to address these research gaps. It explores the impact of two psychological associations with brand: brand image and brand trust (in relation to individual values, country of origin and promotion channel) on Chinese students' choice of international tertiary education provider, using the Bednall and Kanuk's (1997) decision-making model as the research's underlying framework.
Since no existing measures or scales related to brand image and brand trust suitable for use in this thesis were identified from the literature, a two-stage research method to collect both qualitative (in-depth interviews) and quantitative data was used to develop measures for this thesis. The adopted research design is consistent with Anderson Churchill (1979) and Gerbing's (1988) guideline for scale development.
Information gathered from 36 in-depth interviews, 416 pilot surveys in Singapore and Malaysia, and 287 surveys (post enrolment data) in New Zealand revealed that choice patterns for international tertiary education providers are focused on: i) A university's brand image, as reflected in the brand positioning messages of an institution competencies, course related issues, and brand identity (university values and missions statement); ii) Brand trust as reflected by the expressed opinion of friends and family members and students' positive experiences with university staff; iii) The social political image of a university's country of origin; iv) The perceived direct barriers to tertiary education (English language proficiency and course admission requirements); and v) High Context communications through education fairs, corporate sponsorships of scholarships/bursaries and international student exchange programs.
In addition, a customer-centric approach to the student-university relationship helped improve the identity and brand image of a university. The presence of senior academic staff (professor level) at education fairs; good accessibility of academic staff on campus; having knowledgeable and culturally sensitive frontline staff (reception &amp; marketing personnel); and small, customised tutorial classes would identify the university as customer-centric and contribute to a positive university life experience. These help projected an image that the university is concerned with their students' learning outcomes. Not only will positive university life experiences lead to improved learning outcomes for students, it helps strengthen future alumni-university relationships, resulting in alumni being willing to promote their alma mater to their children, friends and colleagues. This free publicity can help enhance the brand image and brand trust in a university, differentiating it from other universities.
This thesis verified the findings of McMahon (1992) that superior economic development in the destination country is not an important 'pull' factor in student mobility. It complimented the findings of Gray, Fam and Llanes (2003) by showing the importance of customised strategy in international education offerings and illustrated the link between brand image and country image (socio-political) in the purchases of educational services, evidence that was absent in the study by Zhou, Lawley and Perry (2000).
While pre-enrolment data from the in-depth interview and pilot survey indicated that Singapore and Malaysian Chinese students are value bound in their decision of New Zealand as their intended study destination, there is no evidence from the main survey (post-enrolment) that individual values had an influence on their choice decision. The in-depth interview indicated that Singapore and Malaysian Chinese students found New Zealand society appealing because of its low corruption and high level of honesty and fairness because these values help to reinforce group harmony, a prominent characteristic of Chinese society. Further research is recommended in this area. Overall, this thesis will contribute to the body of knowledge in students' decision-making and university branding.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">branding (marketing)</field><field name="subject">brand name products</field><field name="subject">college choice</field><field name="subject">foreign students</field><field name="subject">study and teaching (higher)</field><field name="subject">higher education</field><field name="subject">universities and colleges</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20090826.121449</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The ecology and management of Southland's black-billed gulls</field><field name="creator">McClellan, Rachel Katherine</field><field name="description">The black-billed gull (Larus bulleri) is a small gull that nests in dense colonies on gravel-bedded rivers in southern New Zealand. This dissertation describes research undertaken in Southland in 2004-2006 that investigates black-billed gull population decline and its causes.
Historical ground counts of nests were calibrated with aerial photography of colonies and population trends analysed. The decline in breeding birds on Southland's four main rivers was equivalent to 6.0%/year (SE 1.8) or 83.6% in 30 years justifying the species' present listing as Endangered. Aerial monitoring is a poor index of the breeding population and major temporal variation was identified in counts.
All re-sighted second-year birds exhibited natal dispersal and -70% left the natal catchment. Forty one percent of birds banded as adults also dispersed to other catchments. Breeding dispersal is apparently unrelated to previous breeding success and the availability of the previous year's colony site, and dispersing birds did not move as groups. Southland's black-billed gulls constitute a single inter-mixing population.
Black-billed gulls selected sites on islands and banks according to availability, and selected rivers consistent with the number of gravel patches. Site vulnerability to floods varied significantly. Re-use of colony sites was positively influenced by use in previous years, the extraction of gravel, site stability and low weed cover. Widespread introduced weeds on colony sites preventing nesting and may have increased flooding risk. Colony size was related to colony area, which was related to gravel patch size.
Investigation of historical changes in breeding habitat availability in Southland indicated a major reduction in gravel habitat on the Lower Oreti River between 1976 and 2002 due to river works including gravel extraction. On the Waiau River, Manapouri Dam construction in 1970 initially increased gravel areas, since reversed in the mid Waiau, and caused a 75% decline in the number of islands. Gravel patch sizes are still declining on the Lower Oreti and possibly the Mid Waiau. Hundreds of gravel patches remain on Southland rivers.
Over 5000 nests in 21 colonies were monitored during incubation. Colony nest success was most influenced by colony location, averaging 90.1% (SE 2.1) on islands within rivers, and 66.8% (SE 2.2) on riverbanks, indicating that terrestrial predators exert the greatest influence on productivity. Breeding success, the mean number of fledglings produced per nest by colony, varied between 0 and 0.88 fledglings (mean 0.32, SE 0.08). Both parameters were positively related to colony size. The three smallest colonies failed to breed successfully, suggesting the presence of an Allee effect.
Deterministic matrix models were used to investigate population trends using survival and productivity estimates for the closely related Kaikoura red-billed gull (L. novaehollandiae scopulinus). Adult survival, followed by breeding success and survival of first year birds, had the greatest influence on population projections. Improvements in most parameters are probably required to reverse the decline of Southland's black-billed gulls.
Predation and disturbance by introduced mammals and the native black-backed gull (L. dominicanus) had the greatest impact on black-billed gull productivity. Most human disturbance is insignificant compared to predator disturbance, but illegal shooting of large numbers of adult gulls has major impacts in smaller sub-populations. Damming and excessive water abstraction reduces island habitat due to lowering of flows. Major climatic events such as droughts, and chemical ingestion through a diet dominated by agricultural invertebrates, are potential major threats about which little is known. Management actions including the collation and analysis of all unpublished black-billed gull count datasets, a thorough test of the accuracy of aerial monitoring, trialling of decoys to attract colonies to nest on islands, predator control at bank colonies, targeted weed control on high quality sites, advocacy and education and further research are recommended.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Larus</field><field name="subject">gulls</field><field name="subject">ecology</field><field name="subject">conservation</field><field name="subject">nests</field><field name="subject">breeding</field><field name="subject">bird populations</field><field name="subject">Southland</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20090827.110233</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A reusable peer-to-peer conversation tool for online second language learning : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Information Science in Computer Science at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Ye, Jun</field><field name="description">To support extramural learning, Johnson (2005) has proposed the Learning Computer concept, which aims to provide a learning appliance that can be used for studying university courses at any time, from anywhere, and by anybody who might have only basic software and hardware, dial-up Internet connection, and little computer literacy. Lonely extramural students need extra support for interactions and collaboration in learning, especially in second language learning that requires intensive oral language practice between the students and the tutor. This research project was a trial to extend IMMEDIATE (the prototype of the Learning Computer) to a second language extramural course. To meet the requirements of long distance conversation in such a course, a synchronous/asynchronous bimodal approach was conceptualised based on a review of e-learning, communication, and VoIP technologies. It was proposed that the prototype should automatically adapt to either synchronous mode or asynchronous mode according to different levels of Internet connection speed. An asynchronous conversation mode similar to Push-to-Talk (PTT) was also proposed. A VoIP SDK was investigated and used in the prototype for fast development. IMMEDIATE messaging protocols have been extended in the prototype to control call procedures and the asynchronous conversation mode. An evaluation of the prototype which was conducted to assess its usability, functionality and integrity of the prototype demonstrated that users can conduct telephone-like synchronous conversation efficiently at high connection speed. Although the PTT-like asynchronous mode has a time lag problem, especially when two users are both at low connection speed, it is a still a good way for novices to practise second language oral skills. The evaluation has given strongly support to the feasibility and effectiveness of the bimodal approach for applying IMMEDIATE in second language extramural learning.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">distance education</field><field name="subject">second language learning</field><field name="subject">peer to peer architecture</field><field name="subject">e-learning</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences::280300 Computer Software</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/865</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Performance, physiological, and perceptual effects of wearing graduated compression stockings during running : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for a degree of Master of Science in Sport and Exercise Science at Massey University, Auckland, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Creasy, Robert</field><field name="description">Purpose: The aims of these studies were to examine the effects of wearing different grades of graduated compression stockings (GCS) on performance, physiological, and perceptual measures before, during, and after exercise in well-trained runners. Method: Two separate running studies were conducted where participants wore different grades of GCS compared with a placebo control stocking in random, counter-balanced order: (1) a field study focussed on a series of 10-km running performances on a 400m track; (2) a laboratory study that examined the effects of 40-min treadmill running on physiological, perceptual, and muscle function responses. Changes in muscle function and damage were determined pre- and post-run by measuring creatine kinase (CK) and myoglobin (Mb) concentrations, counter-movement jump (CMJ) height, muscle soreness, and pressure sensitivity. Physiological measurements of heart rate (HR), oxygen uptake (V&amp;O2), blood lactate concentration [La], and ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) were measured during running. Pre- and post-run perceptual scales assessed comfort, tightness and pain associated with wearing GCS. Results: There were no significant differences in 10-km run time, mean HR, V&amp;O2, [La], and RPE for participants wearing different GCS in (1) and (2) (P&lt;0.05). Con and Low were rated most comfortable (P&lt;0.05) and Hi were tightest (P&lt;0.05) and induced more pain (P&lt;0.05) when GCS were compared in both studies. CMJ was better in participants wearing Low and Med GCS post-run compared with Con in (1) and for Con and all GCS at 0 h post-exercise in (2). CK and Mb levels were higher (P&lt;0.05) and pressure sensitivity was more pronounced (P&lt;0.05) at 0 h post-run for Con and all GCS (2). Few participants (4/10) reported muscle soreness at any one location in (2). Conclusions: Well-trained runners did not experience improved performance, physiological, or perceptual responses when wearing different grades of GCS during 10- km track or 40 min treadmill running compared with a control garment. 40 min treadmill running at 80% V&amp;O2 max may not be strenuous enough to elicit a loss of muscle function in well-trained runners. Runners felt more comfortable wearing GCS that had less compression.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">running performance</field><field name="subject">muscle function</field><field name="subject">physiological measurements</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321400 Human Movement and Sports Science::321401 Exercise physiology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/866</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mental health consumers' evaluation of recovery-oriented service provision</field><field name="creator">Marshall, Sarah Louise</field><field name="description">Consumers have rarely been involved in the evaluation of recovery oriented service provision. This is somewhat surprising considering the increasing emphasis on recovery focused service delivery both in Australia and internationally (Australian Health Ministers, 2003; Slade, Amering, &amp; Oades, 2008).  This thesis addresses this gap by involving consumers in the evaluation, critique and ongoing improvement of the Collaborative Recovery Model received in case management settings across three eastern Australian states. The Collaborative Recovery Model has been used as a model to train mental health staff in evidence-based practices and constructs consistent with the recovery movement to assist them to effectively support the recovery process of people with chronic and recurring mental disorders. Key aspects of this model include two guiding principles &#8216;recovery as an individual process&#8217; and &#8216;collaboration and autonomy support&#8217; and four skills-based components 1) change enhancement; 2) collaborative needs identification; 3) collaborative goal striving and 4) collaborative task striving and monitoring (Oades et al., 2005). This thesis incorporates three key studies as part of the overall evaluation.  Study one (self-report questionnaire) sought to gain the broader perceptions of consumers&#8217; and case managers&#8217; regarding engagement in and perceived importance of recovery-focused practice received with staff trained in the Collaborative Recovery Model, when compared to consumers&#8217; and case managers&#8217; perceptions around receiving services as usual (non Collaborative Recovery Model trained staff). A questionnaire was developed and completed by 92 consumers and 97 case managers. Preliminary findings suggest that consumers working with Collaborative Recovery Model trained staff were able to identify significant changes to service delivery in relation to the frequency with which they were:  encouraged to take responsibility for recovery, collaborated with staff and completed homework activities to assist them to achieve their goals. In contrast to findings for consumers, case managers did not report that they engaged in activities consistent with the Collaborative Recovery Model more frequently when they had received training. The vast majority of consumers and case managers appeared to value, or place importance on key parts of the Collaborative Recovery Model.  Study two (semi structured interviews) sought to explore in detail consumers&#8217; perceptions regarding the Collaborative Recovery Model as received in case management settings and its use in relation to supporting their personal recovery journey. Twenty two consumers were purposively sampled. Findings provided insight into processes considered valuable by consumers. For example, with respect to goal striving and homework activities consumers discussed benefits in relation to providing a sense of direction for life, encouraging ownership and responsibility, benefits of formal documentation and positive feelings of achievement and personal growth, among others. Concerns were offered by some participants such as appropriateness of the terminology &#8216;homework&#8217; and some consumers preference for the term &#8216;life&#8217; over the term &#8216;recovery.&#8217; Other concerns reflected a deeper need for improved transfer of the Collaborative Recovery Model in practice within mental health services, as opposed to criticism of the conceptual model per se. Study three (focus group meetings) incorporated a reflexive design bringing together groups of consumers to discuss key findings from study one and two. The central aim was to generate further feedback to inform improvement of the Collaborative Recovery Model and its use and delivery in services. Eighteen consumers were purposively sampled. Findings offered further support for many earlier concerns and recommendations, for example concerns around terminology and transfer of training issues. Additional concerns and ideas were also raised including the inadequacy of orientation to the Collaborative Recovery Model, concerns around the existing format of goal and homework sheets and suggestions for redevelopment of sheets into a book format, owned and individualised by consumers. In summary, consumers were able to perceive some recovery-focused changes following staff training in the Collaborative Recovery Model. Consumers and case managers valued the key guiding principles and components of this model. However consumers wanted to be more empowered and involved in use of the model from the outset such as through an equivalent training/introductory session, a peer led group to introduce and share experiences of recovery and use of a hand held diary to record goal striving to be personalised and owned by consumers. Such directions around empowering consumers to take more responsibility for usage of the model and hence their own recovery may also hold promise for addressing difficulties regarding transfer of the Collaborative Recovery Model from theory into practice within mental health services.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/824</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Key biological parameters and commercial fishery for ocean leatherjackets 'Nelusetta ayraudi' (Monacanthidae) off the coast of New South Wales, Australia</field><field name="creator">Miller, Marcus E</field><field name="description">Ocean leatherjackets (Nelusetta ayraudi) are distributed along the entire coast of New South Wales (NSW) contributing significantly to the total catch of fish taken from the NSW Ocean Trap and Line Fishery (~340 tonnes in 2005/2006), in addition to other NSW fisheries, such as the Ocean Fish, Ocean Prawn and Haul-net Fisheries.    In spite of their significance in commercial fisheries world-wide, only few studies have aged monacanthids.  Of those, researchers have mainly used bony structures, such as vertebrae and anterior dorsal spines.  In this study, commercially captured ocean leatherjackets were aged by counting growth increments in thin-sectioned otoliths. The periodicity of increment formation was validated using a vital stain oxy-tetracycline (OTC) injected into young of the year fish (0+).  The von Bertalanffy growth function parameters provided good estimates of growth, k = 0.163 yr-1, t0 = -0.565 yrs and L&#8734; = 886 mm.  The fishery was found to be dominated by two and three year old fish making up 83% of the ocean leatherjackets captured.  The oldest fish (5+) and largest fish from both sexes (male &#8211; 605 mm, female &#8211; 656 mm) were found in northern NSW.  All fish displayed a rapid rate of growth especially as juveniles, with no significant differences in growth between sexes and locations (southern and northern NSW). Ocean leatherjackets showed a geographical and temporal &#8216;preference&#8217; for spawning.  Gonado-somatic indices (GSI) revealed a peak in spawning during August in northern NSW.  During this period adult fish were observed, via depth soundings, in large aggregations in depths ranging from 45 to 80 fathoms.  Ocean leatherjackets are pelagic egg broadcasters with no parental egg care.  Oocytes from ovulated ocean leatherjackets had a mean diameter of 0.66 mm (&#177; S.E. 0.002).  The estimated size and age at maturity (L50) for each sex was 352 mm and 2.5+ years old.  Mature fish of each sex displayed clear differences in dimorphic and dichromatic features. This research has provided the biological information necessary for future stock assessments of ocean leatherjackets in NSW.  In addition, it has contributed to management strategies designed to enhance the sustainability of the ocean leatherjackets fishery.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/26</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The isotopic signature of nitrous oxide emitted from agricultural soils measured by FTIR spectroscopy</field><field name="creator">Parkes, Stephen</field><field name="description">Agriculture contributes 16% to Australia&#8217;s greenhouse gas emissions, of which 23% are the result of nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions. Global N2O emissions from agricultural activities have increased substantially since the beginning of the industrial revolution. This has been driven by the increase in the amount of nitrogen added to agricultural soils, stimulating the N2O-producing nitrification and denitrification processes. Currently there is a poor quantitative understanding of N2O emissions from nitrification and denitrification and their controlling parameters. This is difficult to quantify since N2O emissions from nitrification and denitrification occur simultaneously. As N2O produced from these microbial processes have different stable isotopic signatures, stable isotope measurements have shown promise as a method to partition N2O emissions. Additionally, the intramolecular 15N site preference of N2O presents a further stable isotopic measurement which can be used for studies of N2O emissions from nitrification and denitrification. In this thesis, the absolute intramolecular 15N site preference of N2O measured using high resolution FTIR. The FTIR system was fully calibrated for site preference measurements of 15N enriched N2O sample. In addition, using the FTIR system the absolute site preference value for the N2O working standard used as a reference for isotopic measurements was determined. Using this absolute site preference value, it was possible to determine a value of 19.9 (&#177;2.1)&#8240; for the absolute site preference of tropospheric N2O. The absolute site preference value of the N2O working standard was used to report measurements of field collected N2O samples on the absolute scale. To determine the intramolecular site preference of N2O produced from nitrification and denitrification, a 2 week field campaign was completed at a dairy farm in south eastern Australia. Soil plots were treated with 15N-labelled NH4 + or NO3 -, either at application rates of 100 or 50 kg-N.ha-1, followed by irrigation. Following treatment, daily measurements were made of the N2O emissions, isotopic composition of N2O, soil mineral nitrogen concentrations and 15N composition, as well as soil moisture. From the interpretation of the collected data, intramolecular site preference signatures of -17 (&#177;5)&#8240; was determined for nitrification and a range of 0.5 to 12.3&#8240; was attributed to denitrification. Using the 15N measurements of N2O, it was possible to estimate the N2O emissions produced from nitrification and denitrification. For all treatments, emissions produced from denitrification far outweighed those from nitrification. These measurements indicated that the reduction of N2O to N2 was a key process controlling N2O emissions. Additionally, there was a clear relationship between the intramolecular site preference of N2O, and the amount of N2O reduced to N2. This relationship was used to estimate that for treatments receiving NH4 +, 5 &#8211; 22% of the applied nitrogen was emitted as N2.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/129</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Heidegger and the mystery of being</field><field name="creator">Reddan, Marion</field><field name="description">Martin Heidegger has been described as the philosopher of being. His work is a critique of the dualistic thinking of the metaphysical tradition, where being is regarded as a fundamental ground, and indubitable knowledge is prioritised over sensuous experience. Heidegger&#8217;s own view is that being is an absence of ground, and a dynamic process in which things emerge into presence from concealment. Whereas the tradition interprets being as a concept, Heidegger focuses on what he describes as &#8220;the experience of being.&#8221; His inquiry draws upon the medieval mystics&#8217; relationship to God, and the Presocratic philosophers&#8217; experience of wonder at the mystery of existence. In an attempt to understand being itself, Heidegger analyses the being of the human, &#8220;Dasein.&#8221; He argues that because we find ourselves thrown into the world and having to face the imminent possibility of death, we engage in a process of self-creation by projecting ourselves into possibilities. In his later work, Heidegger presents the idea that being and Dasein belong to each other, and can only be understood on the basis of an originary form of difference that is both a union and a separation.                    My theory is that the dualities structuring thought and language are a consequence of our existence as embodied, spatio-temporal beings, and that metaphysics is one of the ways in which that duality is expressed. I compare Heidegger&#8217;s notion of originary difference with the concepts of ch&#333;ra in Plato, and the apeiron in Anaximander. The two Greek philosophers describe a dynamic, non-dual state of potential from which everything that exists is generated and sustained. Such a state is reflected in the interpretations of mystical experience, where subjects in various traditions throughout history have reported a sense of oneness in the apparent dissolution of the temporal and the spatial. In contrast to Heidegger&#8217;s later view that mysticism is an expression of metaphysics, I propose that mystical experience is a pathway to the experience of being. {Contact author: vkaqm88d@netspace.net.au}</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/825</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Contribution to privacy-preserving cryptographic techniques</field><field name="creator">Au, Man Ho Allen</field><field name="description">Digital signatures are fundamental cryptographic primitives.

We also propose two novel constructions of accumulators. Based on our signature schemes and accumulators, we design two compact electronic cash schemes and a divisible electronic cash scheme. All our schemes are truly anonymous, meaning that privacy of the users is well-protected. We also explore other applications of our newly proposed signatures and accumulators. Specifically, we give a construction of k-times anonymous authentication schemes and attribute-based anonymous credential systems.During the course of the development of the thesis, we generalise existing techniques of zero-knowledge proof-of-knowledge protocol of double-discrete logarithms into zero-knowledge proof-of-knowledge protocol of representation of a committed value. Our protocol is compatible with existing zero-knowledge proof-of-knowledge protocols that demonstrate relationship amongst discrete logarithms. We believe that this protocol, together with the newly introduced primitives, are of independent interest.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/826</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Network power: an international study of strengthening housing association capacity</field><field name="creator">Gilmour, Tony</field><field name="description">Doctor of Philosophy</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Housing association</field><field name="subject">Capacity building</field><field name="subject">Hybrid organisation</field><field name="subject">Social housing networks</field><field name="subject">Community housing</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/5393</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Erosion modelling under different land use management practices</field><field name="creator">Pudasaini, Madhu S.</field><field name="description">Soil erosion has been recognised as a global threat against the sustainability of natural ecosystem. The work in this thesis has been undertaken to assist in combating this threat, and addresses the soil erosion issues associated with urban construction activities. The Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) was employed in this research work and the parameters associated with the model were calibrated. This model was chosen for calibration, as it has been proven to be an easy to use tool yet providing reasonable results. Large scale rainfall simulators developed at UWS were used for rainfall simulation at two sites with diverse soil types: dispersive clayey soils at Penrith and highly permeable sandy soil at Somersby (Both in New South Wales, Australia). It is concluded that RUSLE can be successfully used in single storms for erosion prediction. Calibrated values of RUSLE parameters are useful in predicting soil erosion from the construction sites in NSW. It is also identified that in rolled smooth land condition, clayey soils are more erodible than sandy soil. Specific support practices such as short grass strips, gravel bags and silt fences are identified as very effective erosion control measures in reducing soil erosion from 45% to 85%. These results will be very useful in soil erosion prediction planning and conservation management in NSW.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">soil erosion</field><field name="subject">soil erosion prediction</field><field name="subject">soil conservation in New South Wales</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/721</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Social ideological influences on food consumption and BMI</field><field name="creator">Wang, Wei Chun</field><field name="description">Social ideologies appeared to influence dietary behaviour, physical activity and BMI.

This investigation has addressed this requirement, with a focus upon a particular timber species - Spotted Gum (corymbia citriodora subsp. variegata), a diversely eminent species of Queensland hardwood timber. The investigation was initiated by collaborating parties within the Co-operative Research Center for Wood Innovations (CRCWI) particularly the Department of Primary Industries &#8211; Forestry Research (DPI&amp;F) in Queensland.  It was decided by the DPI&amp;F that an industrial design contribution, through the instigation of a design research led investigation would be a beneficial avenue for addressing prevalent issues in the forestry and furniture industries. Background research processes undertaken in both the forestry and furniture industries in a geographically specific area of Queensland were vital in establishing immediate investigation parameters.  Following the establishment of these parameters and their accepted relevance to broader national industry concerns, the consequent development of an appropriate research method in this investigation was undertaken. The method generated needed to address two major issues. First, to address technical problems in the application of Spotted Gum timber to the production fine furniture, surpassing various initiatives to resolve these issues in the past, secondly, to address a lack of market knowledge, with regard to product design parameters for export markets within the participating Queensland furniture manufacturing industry. The method employed seeks to establish the degree of cultural difference that must be accounted for by manufacturers in developing products specifically for export market integration. This theory was tested by the development of two experimental indoor dining chairs, that were designed and prototyped, recognising to the best degree possible the exceptional technical requirements of Spotted Gum timber. Each of the two chairs were developed to the requirements of pre-determined market and user oriented needs of a separate case study destination, determined through qualitative and quantatative information generation. The specific niche market design parameters applied to design development, created a precursory theory that the products would have a greater degree of success in market integration if they were designed for specific niche market parameters.Each of the chairs was then exhibited in an appropriate market arena for the destination for which it was designed. A series of questions seeking preferences for each of the chairs, and the reasons for those preferences were solicited from those attending both of the exhibitions. The testing process resulted in a conclusion that there is little cultural difference that must be accounting for in approaching design development for the two international markets identified tested as case studies. The initial chair designs, developed and used in the testing role within the investigation, were according re-designed given the findings of the market testing process.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">English</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Corymbia maculata</field><field name="subject">Export</field><field name="subject">Furniture design</field><field name="subject">Hardwood industry</field><field name="subject">Industrial design</field><field name="subject">Queensland</field><field name="subject">Timber</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1959.3/64837</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Speaking the unspoken: the ontology of writing a novel</field><field name="creator">Colbert, Elizabeth Dianne</field><field name="description">Creative practitioners, undertaking practice-led research, theorise their practice within an academic domain. Within a three-tiered, performative research paradigm, this project researched writerly identity during the writing of a novel and exegesis. Firstly, based on the writer&#8217;s experience with creative and academic writing, the differences were explored through two first-person narratives in a frametale novel, The Fragility Papers, a process documented by critical and reflective journaling. Secondly, the insights gained during the writing of the novel were theorised within the domain of creative writers. Thirdly, the understandings embedded in the novel were considered in the light of these insights and those gained during writing of the exegesis and further theorised within the areas of voice, the writing process and ontological change. Novel writing, it was found, drew not only on the imagination, research, in-flow stream of consciousness writing and serendipitous occurrences but also on personal embodied inscriptions, linguistic play, logic and reason in the development of narrative coherence, forward planning, previously unidentified editing values based in the sonority of language, and a knowledge of the expectations associated with the literary genre. Acknowledging this breadth of experience led to changes in the writer&#8217;s creative-writing process, a questioning of the theorised sole influence of language based texts as proposed in intertextual theory, and the proposal to italicise &#8216;text&#8217; within intertextual to accommodate this breadth. The theorising of insights and emerging, experiential knowledge during the writing of the exegesis was realised in a series of evolving drafts in which interiorised knowledge was increasingly drawn upon in stream of consciousness writing. Further, in both genres, the dialogic engagement of the writer in conscious and unconscious activity at different stages of the writing process was found, suggesting that unconscious activity has a larger than envisaged role to play in academic writing.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">English</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Academic writing</field><field name="subject">Authorship</field><field name="subject">Creative writing</field><field name="subject">Fiction</field><field name="subject">Novel writing</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1959.3/64875</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Populating the galaxy with pulsars</field><field name="creator">Kiel, Paul D.</field><field name="description">Prior to this thesis no serious attempt has been made within binary system population synthesis research to model the selection effects of observational surveys. Conversely, many pulsar population models have accounted for radio survey selection effects but not detailed binary evolution. Such modelling becomes especially important when comparing theory directly to observations. In examining the factors that influence pulsar evolution, both in binary systems and as single stellar objects, we have bridged this existing gap between these two research fields. This thesis populates a model Galaxy with binary systems and evolves the population forward in time. A prediction of the Galactic pulsar population characteristics is produced, at the assumed age of the Galaxy, after we have accounted for detailed changes in stellar and binary evolution and Galactic kinematics. Synthetic observational surveys mimicking a variety of radio pulsar surveys are then performed on this population. The population synthesis synthetic survey (PS3) package is comprised of three components: stellar/binary evolution (binpop), Galactic kinematics (binkin), and survey selection effects (binsfx). The resultant pulsar populations, assuming the magnetic-dipole decay and accretion induced magnetic decay models, can compare well to many of the detected pulsar population characteristics. The comparisons between models and observations have lead to the conclusions described below. The models exclude short (&#8764; 5 Myr) timescales for standard pulsar exponential field decay and find that ablation of low-mass millisecond pulsar companions can redress both the lack of synthetic isolated pulsars and their excessive distances in height from the Galactic plane. Coalescing double neutron star and collapsar Galactic populations, evolved owing to standard binary evolutionary assumptions, are too centrally concentrated owing to the typical merger timescale of double neutron stars being a few million years. Dwarf galaxy models of coalescing double neutron stars and collapsars produce equally good agreement with long gamma-ray burst projected distances. Therefore our models cannot provide any distinction between which of these populations (coalescing double neutron stars or collapsars) are the progenitor of long gamma-ray bursts. The Galactic birth rate of double neutron star binaries in our model is 8.2 Myr&#8722;1 and the merger rate is 6.8 Myr&#8722;1. Scintillation is found to be an important aspect in the detection of low flux density pulsars. The assumed pulsar luminosity law is found to require an inverse trend with spin period and our favoured models suggest that there are one million radio active pulsars within the Galaxy.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">English</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Binaries</field><field name="subject">Double stars</field><field name="subject">Galaxies</field><field name="subject">Neutron stars</field><field name="subject">Pulsars</field><field name="subject">Stellar evolution</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1959.3/64888</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Design and construction of a novel thermal interferometer</field><field name="creator">Kumar, Nishith</field><field name="description">Abstract not available.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">English</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Construction</field><field name="subject">Design</field><field name="subject">Interferometers</field><field name="subject">Photo acoustic effect</field><field name="subject">Thermal analysis</field><field name="subject">Thermal waves</field><field name="subject">Thin films</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1959.3/64905</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Entrepreneur or accountant? an exploratory study of accounting public practitioners and their accounting practices in Victoria and Tasmania</field><field name="creator">Dunkley, Mary E.</field><field name="description">Abstract not available.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">English</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Accountants</field><field name="subject">Accounting</field><field name="subject">Entrepreneurship</field><field name="subject">Pyschology</field><field name="subject">Tasmania</field><field name="subject">Victoria</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1959.3/64922</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effects of sleep deprivation on simulated driving, neurocognitive functioning and brain activity in professional drivers</field><field name="creator">Jackson, Melinda L.</field><field name="description">Sleepiness contributes to between 20 and 30% of all heavy vehicle accidents throughout the world each year. Professional drivers are particularly susceptible to the effects of sleepiness, due to chronic or acute sleep deprivation, time-on-task effects, driving at circadian low points, and increased daytime sleepiness resulting from sleep disorders. Population surveys of heavy vehicle drivers indicates that a small proportion of drivers use pharmaceutical means in order to help maintain alertness during long-haul trips. Despite the known benefits of amphetamine-type stimulants on reducing fatigue and sleepiness, epidemiological evidence suggests that a large percentage of fatally injured professional drivers test positive to amphetamines. The primary objective of the current thesis was to determine the underlying causes of these sleep- and drug-related accidents. Experimentally, driving performance can be broken down into specific components that can be examined independently. Measures of behavioural disposition provide an indication of the drivers&#8217; mood, ability to determine a change in performance and sleepiness, and whether the driver can make appropriate decisions regarding their ability to drive safely when sleep-deprived. Simulated driving tasks are commonly used to detect driving-related performance in a controlled and safe environment. The task of driving involves a number of components, including attention and vigilance, processing speed and reaction time, visual processes, and executive functioning, which can be measured using neurocognitive tasks. Smaller, pre-conscious neural processes that are undetected by behavioural tasks may also be affected by sleep deprivation, and in turn, affect driving performance. Electrophysiological (eventrelated potentials; ERPs) and neuroimaging (functional magnetic resonance imaging; fMRI) measures can be used to determine the neural underpinnings of visual and auditory processes after sleep deprivation. The aim of this thesis was to determine the effects of one night of sleep deprivation on these driving-related processes in professional drivers. In Experiment 1, nineteen professional drivers underwent two randomised sessions; one session following a normal night of sleep and one session following 24-hours of sleep deprivation. Behavioural disposition, simulated driving performance, neurocognitive measures related to driving, and visual and auditory ERPs were examined in both sessions. Subjective ratings of sleepiness and sleepiness symptoms increased significantly following sleep deprivation. Simulated driving performance and neurocognitive measures of vigilance and reaction time were impaired after sleep deprivation, whereas tasks examining processing speed and executive functioning were less susceptible to sleep deprivation. Event-related potentials of visual and auditory processing indicated that early visual processes were unaffected by sleep deprivation, whereas the amplitude of later cognitive processing was attenuated after sleep deprivation. Driving also involves the ability of the driver to divide his or her attention between different sensory modalities in the driving environment. Experiment 2 presents a functional neuroimaging experiment examining the effect of sleep deprivation on neural activations that occur in response to a cross-modal divided attention task. There was no significant effect of sleep deprivation on behavioural performance. Following sleep deprivation, increased activation was observed in the temporal gyrus, cerebellum and precuneus, compared to activations observed after normal sleep. As no behavioural changes were observed, the results suggest that additional activation may act as a compensatory mechanism. The restorative effect of d-amphetamine on sleep deprivation related impairment was examined in Experiment 3. This pilot study examined eight professional drivers who were past or current users of amphetamine across four, randomised sessions; after normal sleep with oral placebo, after sleep deprivation with oral placebo,  after normal sleep with 0.42mg/kg oral d-amphetamine, and after sleep deprivation and 0.42mg/kg oral d-amphetamine. Measures of behavioural disposition appeared to be more affected by d-amphetamine administration after sleep deprivation compared to simulated driving and neurocognitive performance, however these findings need further clarification in a larger sample. The results of the present thesis highlight the detrimental influence of sleep deprivation on a range of driving-related processes. The experienced, professional drivers in this study were able to recognise signs and symptoms of sleepiness, and acted upon these indicators appropriately. Measures of driving-related performance on both simulated driving, and simple neurocognitive tasks were negatively affected by sleep loss, although there is likely to be a discrepancy between on-road and laboratory behaviour. ERP and neuroimaging findings in the present thesis suggest that these sleep-related behavioural effects are caused by small changes in neural processing and neural recruitment. Sleep deprivation can have large implications for safe driving, and this study highlights the importance of promoting and educating the driving public about the dangers of driving when sleepy.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">English</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Automobile driving</field><field name="subject">Cognition</field><field name="subject">Motor vehicle drivers</field><field name="subject">Neuroimaging</field><field name="subject">Physiological effect</field><field name="subject">Sleep deprivation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1959.3/64926</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Bacterial attachment to micro- and nano- structured surfaces</field><field name="creator">Mitik-Dineva, Natasa</field><field name="description">The ongoing interest in bacterial interactions with various surfaces, followed by attachment and subsequent biofilm formation, has been driven by the importance of bacterial activities in number of medical, industrial and technological applications. However, bacterial adhesion to surfaces has not been completely understood due to the complexity of parameters involved. The study presented herein investigates the attachment pattern of nine medically and environmentally significant bacteria belonging to different taxonomic lineages: Firmicutes - Bacillus, Gammaproteobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria and Bacteriodetes. Physicochemical assessment techniques such as contact angle and surface charge measurements, atomic force microscopy (AFM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), confocal microscopy (CLSM), as well as X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (XRF) and time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectroscopy (ToF-SIMS) analysis were all employed in order to attain better insight into the factors that influence bacterial interactions with surfaces. Bacterial surface characteristics such as surface wettability and charge in addition to substratum surface wettability, tension, charge and chemistry were also considered. However due to the recent interest in designing micro-textured surfaces with antibacterial and/or antifouling effects the prime was given to the influence of micro- and nano-meter scale surface textures on bacterial adhesion. The interactions between selected bacteria and glass, polymer and optical fibre surfaces were studied. Carefully designed methods for surface modification allowed alteration of the topography of glass, polymer and optical fibre surfaces while maintaining other surface parameters near constant. This allowed isolated assessment of only the effects of surface roughness on bacterial adhesion. Obtained results indicated consistent cellular inclination towards the smoother surfaces for all of the tested species. Enhanced bacterial presence on the smoother surfaces was also accompanied by changes in the bacterial metabolic activity as indicated by the elevated levels of secreted extracellular polymeric materials (EPS) and modifications in the cells morphology. The results indicate that nano-scale surface roughness exert greater influence on bacterial adhesion than previously believed and should therefore be considered as a parameter of primary interest alongside other wellrecognized factors that control initial bacterial attachment.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">English</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Adhesion</field><field name="subject">Bacteria</field><field name="subject">Biofilms</field><field name="subject">Measurement</field><field name="subject">Surface roughness</field><field name="subject">Topography</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1959.3/48547</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Improving Centruflow using semantic web technologies : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Computer Science at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Giles, Jonathan Andrew</field><field name="description">Centruflow is an application that can be used to visualise structured data. It does this by drawing graphs, allowing for users to explore information relationships that may not be visible or easily understood otherwise. This helps users to gain a better understanding of their organisation and to communicate more effectively. In earlier versions of Centruflow, it was difficult to develop new functionality as it was built using a relatively unsupported and proprietary visualisation toolkit. In addition, there were major issues surrounding information currency and trust. Something had to be done, and this was a sub-project of this thesis. The main purpose of this thesis however was to research and develop a set of mathematical algorithms to infer implicit relationships in Centruflow data sources. Once these implicit relationships were found, we could make them explicit by showing them within Centruflow. To enable this, relationships were to be calculated based on providing users with the ability to 'tag' resources with metadata. We believed that by using this tagging metadata, Centruflow could offer users far more insight into their own data. Implementing this was not a straight-forward task, as it required a considerable amount of research and development to be undertaken to understand and appreciate technologies that could help us in our goal. Our focus was primarily on technologies and approaches common in the semantic web and 'Web 2.0' areas. By pursuing semantic web technologies, we ensured that Centruflow would be considerably more standards-compliant than it was previously. At the conclusion of our development period, Centruflow had been rather substantially 'retrofitted', with all proprietary technologies replaced with equivalent semantic web technologies. The result of this is that Centruflow is now positioned on the forefront of the semantic web wave, allowing for far more comprehensive and rapid visualisation of a far larger set of readily-available data than what was possible previously. Having implemented all necessary functionality, we validated our approach and were pleased to find that our improvements led to a considerably more intelligent and useful Centruflow application than was previously available. This functionality is now available as part of 'Centruflow 3.0', which will be publicly released in March 2008. Finally, we conclude this thesis with a discussion on the future work that should be undertaken to improve on the current release.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">semantic web technologies</field><field name="subject">CentruFlow</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences::280100 Information Systems</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/801</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Proteolytic depilation of lambskins : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of philosophy in Bioprocess Engineering at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Edmonds, Richard</field><field name="description">The processing of lambskins plays an important role in the New Zealand meat industry. The use of enzyme dewooling offers considerable advantages over the conventional depilation method which generates unpleasant working conditions and poses product quality risks when not properly handled. Prior to this work it was unclear from the literature why the practice of enzymatic depilation had not generally been adopted by industry. The aim of this work was to determine the problems associated with enzymatic depilation and provide a mechanistic understanding of the dewooling and damaging processes of enzyme depilation to provide underpinning knowledge for the design of a successful enzymatic depilation system. It was found that variability in depilation between different regions of the skin resulted in either over exposure of the skin to the enzyme regent and subsequent damage or underexposure of the skin to the enzyme reagent and incomplete depilation. Two approaches were taken in the work: Firstly an attempt was made for the first time to understand the variability in enzymatic depilation so that the variability observed in enzymatic depilation could potentially be reduced, thereby allowing a complete depilation process with no overexposure. Secondly an investigation was made for the first time to understand the cause of damage to skins during the process of enzymatic depilation so that the enzyme depilation process could potentially be modified to avoid damage. Experimental work characterising the time course of depilation and damage development was carried out and compared with the variation of physical properties across the skin. Correlations between depilation and physical properties such as thickness, grease content and follicle density were found. Reduction in the variability of these properties would likely improve the evenness of depilation but would not reduce it enough to eliminate damage due to over exposure. A range of techniques including: immunohistology, 2-dimensional electrophoresis, matrix assisted laser desorption ionisation, and atomic force microscopy were used to probe the structural and biochemical mechanism of enzyme depilation and damage. In this way it was found that the removal of minor collagen components were the likely cause of damage observed. In particular the removal of collagen VI was associated with a disruption of the smooth mesh of fine collagen fibres observed at the surface of the leather. The key requirement identified for a successful enzyme depilation system was the use of a broad spectrum protease which has no activity against collagen VI. The means to select a protease with these attributes was also developed by adopting a micro depilation assay incorporating immunohistology. This knowledge will enable the future development of non damaging enzyme depilatory reagents that could revolutionise the industry.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">enzyme depilation</field><field name="subject">collagen</field><field name="subject">immunohistology</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::291400 Materials Engineering::291499 Materials engineering not elsewhere classified</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/892</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Academic Business: Tensions between academic values and corporatisation of Australian higher education in graduate schools fo business</field><field name="creator">Ryan, Suzanne Erina</field><field name="description">Doctor of Philosophy (PhD)</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">higher education</field><field name="subject">organisational change</field><field name="subject">critical theory Habermas</field><field name="subject">business schools</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/5398</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Making of Good Citizens: Participation Policies, the Internet and Youth Political Identities in Australia and the United Kingdom</field><field name="creator">Collin, Philippa J</field><field name="description">Doctor of Philosophy (PhD)</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Youth</field><field name="subject">Political Identity</field><field name="subject">Internet</field><field name="subject">Citizenship</field><field name="subject">Policy</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/5399</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">BUDDHIST DELIVERANCE:  A RE-EVALUATION OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SAMATHA AND VIPASSAN&#256;</field><field name="creator">Saitanaporn, Phramonchai</field><field name="description">Doctor of Philosophy(PhD)</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Buddhism</field><field name="subject">meditation</field><field name="subject">philosophy</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/5400</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The emergence of the Nanyang style and its role in the regionalism of ASEAN countries</field><field name="creator">Chua, Ek Kay</field><field name="description">ASEAN has been carrying out art activities since its formation in 1967. Some of the artists from the region have initiated discussions about their traditional cultures and aesthetic discourses in recent years. One of the main issues during the 93 Symposium at Manilla was to call for an Asean aesthetic identity. It was due to the increasing awareness of the growing consciousness of culture and identity in the region. This paper begins with the history of the Nanyang Style which was established by a group of immigrant artists from China during the 30s and 40s. The Nanyang Style of art was an integration of traditional Chinese ink and wash painting, and was influenced by the School of Paris and local subject matter. By synthesising these three elements, the Nanyang artists were able to imbue a sense of local consciousness within their works. During the 1950s the Nanyang artists had extended their aesthetic explorations to Bali and since then Balinese indigenous art has become a major influence on the Nanyang Style. This was seen as an issue of regionalism in the early art history of Singapore. Nanyang Style became the mainstream in visual arts practice in Singapore until it was replaced by Abstract Expressionism and Pop art in the 1970s. Attempted in this paper however, is a re-examination of the Nanyang Style in order to demonstrate its significant contribution to the art world of Singapore. This paper also suggets that Nanyang Style might be reassessed as a metaphor for Singaporean cultural identity given its synthesised characteristics. This reassessment will further contribute to the broader debate concerning the shaping of an ASEAN aesthetic in the region</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">art</field><field name="subject">artists</field><field name="subject">Singapore</field><field name="subject">Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts</field><field name="subject">aesthetics</field><field name="subject">regionalism</field><field name="subject">Southeast Asia</field><field name="subject">Nanyang style</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/715</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Importance of Non-Anatomical Factors in the Pathogenesis of Obstructive Sleep Apnoea</field><field name="creator">Ratnavadivel, Rajeev</field><field name="description">Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is a common condition characterized by recurrent complete and partial upper airway obstruction. OSA sufferers have been shown to have a significantly smaller upper airway lumen compared to non-OSA sufferers. However, non-anatomical factors of sleep stage, arousability and neuromechanical responses to airway occlusion and chemosensitivity are likely to play a significant part in influencing OSA severity across the night. An exploration of these non-anatomical factors forms the basis for the experiments in this thesis.

In the first experimental chapter presented in this thesis, a detailed retrospective epoch by epoch analysis of nocturnal polysomnography in 253 patients referred to a clinical sleep service was performed to examine differences in sleep apnoea severity and arousal indices across the different stages of sleep, while controlling for posture. Both patients with and without OSA demonstrated significant reductions in respiratory and arousal event frequencies from stage 1 to 4 with intermediate frequencies in REM sleep. Lateral posture was also associated with significant improvements in OSA and arousal frequencies, with an effect size comparable to that of sleep stage. The majority of patients showed significant reductions in OSA severity during slow wave sleep. In non-REM sleep, there was a strong correlation between OSA severity and arousal frequency. These results confirm in a large group of patients, a strong sleep stage dependence of both OSA and arousal frequencies.

The second study in this thesis explores the development of a CO2 stabilising or &#145;clamp&#146; device to enable the provision of positive airway pressure, and by proportional rebreathing, the maintenance of relatively constant end-tidal CO2 despite significant hyperventilation. Healthy volunteers performed brief periods of significant voluntary hyperventilation at 2 levels of CPAP with the rebreathing function off and with active CO2 clamping in randomized order. Compared to CPAP alone, the device substantially attenuated hypocapnia associated with hyperventilation.

The third study of the thesis was designed to investigate if increasing and stabilizing end-tidal CO2 could improve obstructive breathing patterns during sleep. 10 patients with severe OSA underwent rapid CPAP dialdown from therapeutic to a sub-therapeutic level to experimentally induce acute, partial upper airway obstruction over 2 minute periods repeated throughout the night. The CO2 clamp device developed and validated in Study 2 was used to determine whether during periods of partial upper airway obstruction with severe flow limitation, (1) increased end-tidal CO2 resulted in improved airflow and ventilation and (2) clamping end-tidal CO2 lessened post-arousal ventilatory undershoot. Three conditions were studied in random order: no clamping of CO2, clamping of end-tidal CO2 3-4 mmHg above eucapnic levels during the pre-dialdown baseline period only, and clamping of CO2 above eucapnia during both baseline and dialdown periods. Elevated CO2 in the baseline period alone or in the baseline and dialdown periods together resulted in significantly higher peak inspiratory flows and ventilation compared to the no clamp condition. Breath-by-breath analysis immediately pre- and post-arousal showed higher end-tidal CO2 despite hyperventilation immediately post-arousal and attenuation of ventilatory undershoot in CO2 versus non-CO2 clamped conditions. These results support that modulation of ventilatory drive by changes in pre- and post-arousal CO2 are likely to importantly influence upper airway and ventilatory stability in OSA.

The fourth study was designed to explore several possible pathophysiological mechanisms whereby obstructive sleep apnoea is improved in stages 3 &amp; 4 (slow wave) versus stage 2 sleep. 10 patients with severe OSA who demonstrated significant reductions in OSA frequency during slow wave sleep on diagnostic investigation were studied. Patients underwent rapid dialdowns from therapeutic CPAP to 3 different pre-determined sub-therapeutic pressures to induce partial airway obstruction and complete airway occlusions in a randomised sequence during the night in both stage 2 and slow wave sleep. Partial airway obstructions and complete occlusions were maintained until arousal occurred or until 2 minutes had elapsed, whichever came first. After airway occlusions, time to arousal, peak pre-arousal negative epiglottic pressure and the rate of ventilatory drive augmentation were significantly greater, suggesting a higher arousal threshold and ventilatory responsiveness to respiratory stimuli during slow wave compared to stage 2 sleep. Post dialdowns, the likelihood of arousal was lower with less severe dialdowns and in slow wave compared to stage 2 sleep. Respiratory drive measured by epiglottic pressure progressively increased post-dialdown, but did not translate into increases in peak flow or ventilation pre-arousal and was not different between sleep stages. These data suggest that while arousal time and propensity following respiratory challenge are altered by sleep depth, there is little evidence to support that upper airway and ventilatory compensation responses to respiratory load are fundamentally improved in slow wave compared to stage 2 sleep. 

In summary, sleep stage, arousal threshold and chemical drive appear to strongly influence upper airway and ventilatory stability in OSA and are suggestive of important non-anatomical pathogenic mechanisms in OSA.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Obstructive sleep apnoea</field><field name="subject">arousal</field><field name="subject">sleep stage</field><field name="subject">sleep posture</field><field name="subject">hypercapnia</field><field name="identifier">http://catalogue.flinders.edu.au./local/adt/public/adt-SFU20090901.162141</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Enabling Gigabit IP for Embedded Systems</field><field name="creator">Tsakiris, Nicholas</field><field name="description">For any practical implementation of chip design, there needs to be a hardware platform available for the purpose of prototyping and implementation of FPGA-based programs, whether they are written in VHDL or Verilog. Communication between the platform and a computer is a useful feature of many hardware solutions as it allows for the capability of regular data transmission between the two devices. Furthermore, the ability to communicate between the platform and a computer at high-speeds requires a specially constructed interface, one that can be modified by the designer at their choosing.

There are a number of commercial packages which provide a hardware platform to perform this task, however there are drawbacks to many of the available options. Some may require special hardware to connect to a computer using proprietary connectors or boards, which increases the cost and reduces the flexibility of any solution. Other options may have limited access to the internal structure of the interface, limiting the ability of the developer to modify the interface to suit their needs. There may be an extra cost to provide the code to the interface, separate from the board, which can also tax design budgets.

This dissertation provides a solution in the form of a Gigabit Ethernet connection with a custom IP/network layer written in VHDL to facilitate the connection. With an increasing number of IP-enabled devices available such as IPTV and set top boxes, the ability to link hardware using Ethernet is very useful and so the development of a lean and capable network layer was considered a suitable focus for the project. The overall goal has been to provide an interface which is cheap, open, robust and efficient, retaining the flexibility a developer might require to modify the code to their needs.

After covering some basic background information about the project, the dissertation looks at the requirements of the board and interface, as well as the alternative interface solutions which were looked at before deciding on Gigabit Ethernet. The protocols used in Ethernet are then covered, with both an explanation of the structure of each and their relevance to the implementation. The Finite State Machines which control operation of the interface are covered in depth, with an explanation of their inter-connectivity to each other and how they fit in the data-flow between the computer and the board. Error correction and reliability is discussed, as well as any remaining components critical to the operation of the interface.

Pipelining, the method of design which provides the speed required for Gigabit Ethernet, is covered along with the extra speed optimisation techniques used in the design such as RAM swinging buffers. Testing and synthesis are covered which ensure the design is as robust as possible, both in simulations and in real-world applications. The final design was implemented on a Xilinx Spartan 3 FPGA (XC3S5000-5FG900C) and capable of a maximum speed of 128.287 MHz, which is more than enough to satisfy the requirements of Gigabit Ethernet under a variety of network conditions. The interface code occupies 1,166 slices of logic on the FPGA (3% of the total amount of logic available), making it sufficiently compact to run large projects on the same chip. The core was tested on physical hardware and performed correctly at real line Gigabit speeds. Configuration of the computer along with the method of connecting to the board and transferring data is mentioned, with explanation of the code run on the computer to make this possible. Finally, the dissertation provides an example application through the use of JPEG2000 image compression/decompression.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">embedded</field><field name="subject">vhdl</field><field name="subject">fpga</field><field name="subject">jpeg</field><field name="subject">jpeg2000</field><field name="subject">pipelining</field><field name="subject">xilinx</field><field name="identifier">http://catalogue.flinders.edu.au./local/adt/public/adt-SFU20090913.204821</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Technology, Ecology and Spirituality: neopaganism and hybrid ontologies in technoculture</field><field name="creator">drsusangallacher@gmail.com</field><field name="description">This thesis considers three convergent issues pertinent to investigations of identity and agency in contemporary society: the proliferation of digital, network technologies, the rise of interest in secular &#151; &#145;new edge&#146; &#151; spiritualities, and our growing awareness of impending ecological crises. I argue that these three issues necessitate a critical reconsideration of human agency, one that embodies a more sustainable and responsible &#145;being-in-the-world&#146;. With this goal in mind, I apply the insights of ecofeminism, feminist approaches to technology and science, and the philosophy of technology, to provide a critical analysis of the human-technology relation in the broader contexts of gender, ecology and spirituality. In particular, I highlight the strengths of ecofeminism, and then employ several alternative theories in order to attend to limitations I identify within ecofeminism; in particular, its uncompromising stance towards modern technology as wholly patriarchal and damaging to both nature and women. Against this position, I argue that technology is fully embedded in and central to our being-in-the-world, and thus must be accounted for in any consideration of contemporary agency. I then attend to both technophobic and technophilic approaches to technology and technoscience in feminism more generally, suggesting how these oppositional tensions are embodied in the figures of the &#145;cyborg&#146; and the &#145;goddess&#146;. In search of more complex, hybridised ways to understand the human-technology relation, I then turn to three key theorists &#150; Don Ihde, Donna Haraway and Bruno Latour. Synergising their approaches with the neopagan worldview, I propose a metaphorical and material identity which properly attends to and incorporates the treble issues of ecology, technology and spirituality into its worldview: the technopagan. At once nature-worshipper and digital dweller, the technopagan is a dynamic, multi-faceted and adaptable agent that can effectively challenge traditional humanist binaries between nature and technology, science and religion, and human and nonhuman.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20090911.144339</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Children Activity Scanning Tool (CAST): a methodological study of an instrument to measure physical activity engagement levels of children in school playgrounds and similar environments: a study of the instrument&#8217;s development through four health promotion projects in NSW Australia</field><field name="creator">Zask, Avigdor</field><field name="description">Thesis aim: This thesis aims to analyse and critically evaluate the Children Activity Scanning Tool (CAST), which measures children&#8217;s physical activity (PA) engagement levels in school playgrounds and similar environments, focusing on CAST reliability and validity using data from four health promotion projects in the Northern Rivers (Move it Groove it (MIGI) project), Illawarra, Central Coast and Dubbo areas in NSW, Australia.The overall research question is whether physical activity engagement levels of large numbers of children can be validly and reliably measured in school playgrounds and similar environments using CAST.Methodology: CAST was used to scan school playgrounds and similar environments, in which unstructured rest, play and other physical activities take place. Scanning was undertaken by a team of trained observers who concurrently scanned a pre-defined area of the playground and recorded the number of children engaged in assigned physical activity intensity categories.Criterion validity was measured in three projects comparing the total number of children counted in separate physical activity categories to an independent count of the number of children in the playground using Pearson correlation coefficients. Data obtained during instrument development were used to determine criterion validity in two projects when compared to videotapes using Pearson correlation, Cronbach alphas and 95% CI around mean engagement levels.Data obtained during development and training, as well as project field data were used for reliability testing. Cronbach alpha, Pearson correlation, factor analysis and 95% CI around mean engagement levels were used to measure inter-rater reliability.Data from multi-level regression models obtained in three projects were used to calculate intra class correlation (ICC) and composite reliabilities of scan and break level physical activity engagement.Results: Criterion validity measures comparing sums of categories counts to independent counts of all children yielded Pearson correlation coefficients of 0.97, 0.81 and 0.96 in the Illawarra, Central Coast and Dubbo projects respectively. Criterion validity measures comparing field and video scores yielded Pearson correlation coefficients of 0.47, 0.52 and 0.56 respectively in the Move it Groove it (MIGI) project, and in the Illawarra study Cronbach alphas of 0.98 and 0.85, and a Pearson correlation of 0.93. There were no significant differences between the mean numbers of children who were engaged in a physical activity level when 95% CI were used except for one category in the MIGI study.Inter-rater reliability estimates in all projects were high or very high. There were no significant differences between the mean numbers of children engaged in a physical activity level when 95% CI were used. Almost 86% (12/14) of the standardised Cronbach alpha estimates were equal to or greater than 0.93. Principal component analysis values ranged from 76%-98%. ICCs obtained from field data yielded composite reliabilities of 0.77-0.94.Conclusion: It was concluded that CAST was a valid and reliable instrument to measure physical activity engagement levels of children in school playgrounds.Recommendations: The two or three categories versions CAST should be used as they produced the highest quality data when used to observe large groups in well-defined playgrounds. Further research is needed to validate other variables (eg equipment), validate a one observer CAST version, and test the feasibility of using children as observers.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Children</field><field name="subject">school playgrounds</field><field name="subject">physical activity</field><field name="subject">health promotion</field><field name="subject">measurement</field><field name="subject">validity</field><field name="subject">reliability</field><field name="subject">Medicine and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/100</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Doing referring in Murriny Patha conversation</field><field name="creator">Blythe, Joe</field><field name="description">Doctor of Philosophy</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Murriny Patha -  person reference</field><field name="subject">Murriny Patha - conversation analysis</field><field name="subject">Aboriginal Australians -- Northern Territory -- Languages.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/5388</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effectively capturing user sessions on the Web using Web server logs</field><field name="creator">Caldera, Amithalal</field><field name="description">The usage of Web sites has been of interest to Web administrators and researchers ever since the Web started. Analysis of Web site usage data helps to understand the behaviour of its users, which is very important, as many important decisions can be made based on it. The user behaviour may be deduced by knowing all the activities each user does from the time s/he starts a session on the Web site until s/he leaves it, which is collectively called a user session. As Web server logs explicitly record the browsing behaviour of site users and are readily and economically available, this thesis explores the use of Web server logs in capturing user sessions on Web. In order to protect users&#8217; privacy, the standard Web server logs in general do not record the user identities or similar measures to uniquely identify the users. This thesis concentrates on heuristic strategies to infer user sessions. The heuristics exploit the background knowledge of user navigational behaviour recorded in the standard Web server logs without requiring additional information through cookies, logins and session ids. They identify relationships that may exist among the log data and make use of them to assess whether requests registered by the Web server can belong to the same individual and whether these requests were performed during the same visit. Researchers have proposed several heuristics, which were adversely affected by proxy servers, caching and undefined referrers. The thesis proposes new heuristics, which effectively address all the limitations, thus extending the work in this field. It also introduces a set of measures to quantify the performance of the heuristics and uses them to investigate their efficiency based on logs from three Web sites and makes recommendations for the Web sites to devise their own heuristics. The investigation has shown satisfactory results and the new heuristics are applicable to wider range of Web sites.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Web usage mining</field><field name="subject">Internet users</field><field name="subject">statistics</field><field name="subject">Web servers</field><field name="subject">heuristic programming</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/11206</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Multisymplectic integration : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Mathematical Physics at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Ryland, Brett Nicholas</field><field name="description">Multisymplectic integration is a relatively new addition to the field of geometric integration, which is a modern approach to the numerical integration of systems of differential equations. Multisymplectic integration is carried out by numerical integrators known as multisymplectic integrators, which preserve a discrete analogue of a multisymplectic conservation law. In recent years, it has been shown that various discretisations of a multi-Hamiltonian PDE satisfy a discrete analogue of a multisymplectic conservation law. In particular, discretisation in time and space by the popular symplectic Runge&#8211;Kutta methods has been shown to be multisymplectic. However, a multisymplectic integrator not only needs to satisfy a discrete multisymplectic conservation law, but it must also form a well-defined numerical method. One of the main questions considered in this thesis is that of when a multi-Hamiltonian PDE discretised by Runge&#8211;Kutta or partitioned Runge&#8211;Kutta methods gives rise to a well-defined multisymplectic integrator. In particular, multisymplectic integrators that are explicit are sought, since an integrator that is explicit will, in general, be well defined. The first class of discretisation methods that I consider are the popular symplectic Runge&#8211;Kutta methods. These have previously been shown to satisfy a discrete analogue of the multisymplectic conservation law. However, these previous studies typically fail to consider whether or not the system of equations resulting from such a discretisation is well defined. By considering the semi-discretisation and the full discretisation of a multi-Hamiltonian PDE by such methods, I show the following: &#8226; For Runge&#8211;Kutta (and for partitioned Runge&#8211;Kutta methods), the active variables in the spatial discretisation are the stage variables of the method, not the node variables (as is typical in the time integration of ODEs). &#8226; The equations resulting from a semi-discretisation with periodic boundary conditions are only well defined when both the number of stages in the Runge&#8211;Kutta method and the number of cells in the spatial discretisation are odd. For other types of boundary conditions, these equations are not well defined in general. &#8226; For a full discretisation, the numerical method appears to be well defined at first, but for some boundary conditions, the numerical method fails to accurately represent the PDE, while for other boundary conditions, the numerical method is highly implicit, ill-conditioned and impractical for all but the simplest of applications. An exception to this is the Preissman box scheme, whose simplicity avoids the difficulties of higher order methods. &#8226; For a multisymplectic integrator, boundary conditions are treated differently in time and in space. This breaks the symmetry between time and space that is inherent in multisymplectic geometry. The second class of discretisation methods that I consider are partitioned Runge&#8211; Kutta methods. Discretisation of a multi-Hamiltonian PDE by such methods has lead to the following two major results: 1. There is a simple set of conditions on the coefficients of a general partitioned Runge&#8211; Kutta method (which includes Runge&#8211;Kutta methods) such that a general multi- Hamiltonian PDE, discretised (either fully or partially) by such methods, satisfies a natural discrete analogue of the multisymplectic conservation law associated with that multi-Hamiltonian PDE. 2. I have defined a class of multi-Hamiltonian PDEs that, when discretised in space by a member of the Lobatto IIIA&#8211;IIIB class of partitioned Runge&#8211;Kutta methods, give rise to a system of explicit ODEs in time by means of a construction algorithm. These ODEs are well defined (since they are explicit), local, high order, multisymplectic and handle boundary conditions in a simple manner without the need for any extra requirements. Furthermore, by analysing the dispersion relation for these explicit ODEs, it is found that such spatial discretisations are stable. From these explicit ODEs in time, well-defined multisymplectic integrators can be constructed by applying an explicit discretisation in time that satisfies a fully discrete analogue of the semi-discrete multisymplectic conservation law satisfied by the ODEs. Three examples of explicit multisymplectic integrators are given for the nonlinear Schr&#168;odinger equation, whereby the explicit ODEs in time are discretised by the 2-stage Lobatto IIIA&#8211; IIIB, linear&#8211;nonlinear splitting and real&#8211;imaginary&#8211;nonlinear splitting methods. These are all shown to satisfy discrete analogues of the multisymplectic conservation law, however, only the discrete multisymplectic conservation laws satisfied by the first and third multisymplectic integrators are local. Since it is the stage variables that are active in a Runge&#8211;Kutta or partitioned Runge&#8211; Kutta discretisation in space of a multi-Hamiltonian PDE, the order of such a spatial discretisation is limited by the order of the stage variables. Moreover, the spatial discretisation contains an approximation of the spatial derivatives, and thus, the order of the spatial discretisation may be further limited by the order of this approximation. For the explicit ODEs resulting from an r-stage Lobatto IIIA&#8211;IIIB discretisation in space of an appropriate multi-Hamiltonian PDE, the order of this spatial discretisation is r - 1 for r = 10; this is conjectured to hold for higher values of r. For r = 3, I show that a modification to the initial conditions improves the order of this spatial discretisation. It is expected that a similar modification to the initial conditions will improve the order of such spatial discretisations for higher values of r.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">multisymplectic integration</field><field name="subject">symplectic geometry</field><field name="subject">mathematical physics</field><field name="subject">Runge-Kutta formulas</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::240000 Physical Sciences::240500 Classical Physics::240501 Acoustics and acoustical devices; waves</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/809</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Concerted evolution of the rDNA ITS1 in the Anopheles punctulatus group</field><field name="creator">Bower, James E</field><field name="description">Repetitive sequences often display a high level of homogeneity within species and can diverge rapidly from homologous copies found in other species. Neither this concerted evolution of repeated sequences nor the non-Mendelian processes of DNA turnover that spread these within a genome are controversial. What remains unclear is the significance of these genomic changes on the subsequent spread of variation within populations. In this thesis, the first ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS1) was examined in the Anopheles punctulatus group to determine what generates intraindividual variation and to determine the significance of turnover in the divergence of An. farauti s.s. populations. Multiple length variants were detected within individuals by PCR and Southern hybridization. A high level of interspecific variation was found among 84 cloned isolates, yet several internal repeats are shared among these species. Much of the length variation is generated by a multicopy 5'-subrepeat, which was identified as a duplication of a conserved ITS2 region. The variation present in an An. farauti s.s. colony indicated that restrictions to interchromosomal recombination are unlikely. Instead, it is the presence of multiple units of turnover that appear to play a key role in the maintenance of intraindividual variation. A potentially recombinant data set of 36 sequences from an experimental mating between two An. farauti s.s. genotypes was analysed by recombination detection methods. No significant evidence was found for recombination, which suggests that substitutions are more important in generating variation. Bayesian phylogenetic analysis of the ITS1 using a data set of 187 sequences from 70 individuals showed that variation in this spacer is congruent with the geographic origin of the An. farauti s.s. samples. Remarkably, intraspecific concerted evolution occurs despite the level of intraindividual variation, while the interpopulation divergence demonstrates a high rate of spread of variation within populations. A quantitative analysis of intraindividual length variants in 14 of these populations was performed with 125 individuals using densitometry and Southern hybridization. Population-specific banding profiles were seen within individuals and the relative proportions of the different length variants within each population were homogeneous among a majority of the individuals. Two temporal samples from a colony also showed the relative abundance of these can change rapidly after just 150 generations. Thus ITS1 variants are spread rapidly in populations with a low level of interindividual variation, which indicates that a high rate of turnover is a significant factor in generating the allopatric divergence of An. farauti s.s.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/122</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A scintillation dual-detector system featuring active Compton suppression</field><field name="creator">Inwood, Dean</field><field name="description">This thesis focuses on the performance characterisation of two prototype scintillation dual-detector radiation monitors that feature active gamma-ray collimation and the suppression of events caused by Compton scattering. This system is currently under development at the Centre for Medical Radiation Physics (CMRP) for radio-guided surgery and lymphoscintigraphy procedures involving low and high-energy gamma ray emitting isotopes. The two CMRP custom-designed configurations of dual-scintillator CsI(Tl) crystals were optically coupled to custom designed Si photodetectors. One configuration, nicknamed &#8220;CD1,&#8221; consists of an N--type Si base with P+-type circular inner and square outer regions, producing a p-n junction, while the other, &#8220;CD2,&#8221; consists of an N--type base with smaller P+-type circular inner and outer regions. Both CD1- and CD2-type configurations were investigated for their current-voltage characteristics, noise, crosstalk levels and system energy resolution for various radioisotopes. Both types of device were then integrated into a Compton-event suppression system. The devices were found to require a reverse bias voltage of not more than -60V for the CD1 type device and &#8211;30V for the CD2 type. Noise prevents the resolving of low energy peaks below around 150 keV for the CD1 type and below 100 keV for the CD2 type and crosstalk levels were found to be &lt;2% on both types of device. Energy resolution of the CD1-type inner detector was found to be approximately 13% for Cs-137&#8217;s 662 keV peak and 8% for the CD2-type inner detector, while the resolution on the outer detector was found to be 21% for Cs-137&#8217;s 662 keV peak for the CD1 type and 19% for the CD2 type. Both devices were successfully integrated into a Compton event suppression system and achieved significant levels of suppression of Compton events that would otherwise contribute to the Compton continuum. These results indicate that the dual-detector system will be satisfactory for radio-guided surgery and lymphoscintigraphy using both low and highenergy radioisotopes.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/828</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Enhancement of connectivity and flux pinning in MgB2 superconducting bulks and wires</field><field name="creator">Lu, Lin</field><field name="description">The objective of this work is to improve the connectivity and flux pinning and hence to enhance the critical current density of MgB2 superconductor by the development of following processes and techniques: densification and use of excess Mg addition, substitution and inclusion by doping with nano C, nano-SiC or carbon nanotube (CNT) and BN. Firstly, a new, direct Mg-diffusion method to synthesize highly dense pure MgB2 bulks has been developed, in which pressed boron bulks are separately packed in sealed iron tubes that have been filled with magnesium powder and then sintered at high temperature over a long period. The influence of the bulk density on the superconducting properties of MgB2 has been investigated through synthesizing bulks with different densities, using a combination of diffusion and the in-situ method. This method is easily applicable to the fabrication of highly dense MgB2 bulks and tape-shaped samples. It was found that the connectivity was significantly improved as the effective area (AF) varied from 0.2 (conventional in-situ) to 0.42 (diffusion), hence the self-field critical current density, Jc, is significantly improved compared with conventional porous MgB2 bulks made by the in-situ method. A sample reacted at 850 &#176;C for 10 hrs exhibited Jc of 1.2 MA/cm2 at 20 K in self-field. Secondly, a novel artificial pinning centre method has been developed by using thermal strain to induce defects in MgB2 superconductors. Strain engineering has been used previously to modify material properties in ferroelectric, superconducting, and ferromagnetic thin films8. The advantage of strain engineering is that it can achieve unexpected enhancement in certain properties, for example, it can&#172; increase the ferroelectric critical temperature, Tc, by 300 to 500&#61616;C, with a minimum detrimental effect on the intrinsic properties of the material. Strain engineering has been largely applied to materials in thin film form, where the strain is generated as a result of lattice mismatch between the substrate and component film, or between layers in multilayer structures.  The residual thermal stress/strain has been observed in dense SiC-MgB2 superconductor composites prepared by the diffusion method.  The thermal strain caused by the different thermal expansion coefficients (&#945;) between the MgB2 and SiC phases is responsible for the significant improvement in the critical current, Jc,  the irreversibility field, Hirr, and the upper critical field, Hc2, in the SiC-MgB2 composite. In contrast to the common practice of improving the Jc and Hc2 of MgB2 through chemical substitution, SiC-MgB2 composite shows only a small drop in Tc and little increase in resistivity but exhibits a significant improvement over the Jc and Hc2 of conventional MgB2 due to the advantage of residual thermal strains. The present findings open up a new direction for manipulation of material properties through strain engineering in materials in various forms.Another part of the work in this thesis was on MgB2 bulks and wires that were fabricated by in-situ solid state reaction and the powder-in-tube method, respectively. The effects of excess Mg on the structure and physical properties, such as the lattice parameters, the critical temperature (Tc), the critical current (Jc), the irreversibility field (Hirr), and the upper critical field (Hc2), have been detailed. It was found that Jc, Hirr, and Hc2 were significantly enhanced for Mg excess samples. All these properties were highly sensitive to the processing temperature for the Mg excess samples, while there was only a weak dependence on processing temperature for normal ones. For the bulks, the Tc variation for the 10% Mg excess sample was 1.6 K (36.3 K to 37.9 K) when the sintering temperature was changed from 650oC to 850oC, while it only varied by 0.5 K (37.2 K to 37.7 K) for the normal sample. The low field Jc for the 10% Mg excess samples sintered at 750oC increased by a factor of 3, compared to that for the normal MgB2 sample, while the Hc2 for the 10% Mg excess samples sintered at 650oC reached 8.7 T at 25 K, compared to 6.6 T for the normal sample. Rietveld refinement x-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis showed that the MgO content was reduced in 10% excess Mg samples, leading to an increase in the effective cross section of the superconductor. MgB2 / Fe wires with 10 at% excess Mg produced by in-situ powder-in-tube processing were compared with normal stoichiometric MgB2 / Fe wires prepared by the same method. It was found that the critical current (Jc) and the irreversibility field (Hirr) were significantly enhanced for MgB2 / Fe wires with excess Mg. The transport Jc for 10 at% Mg excess samples sintered at 800oC, measured in fields up to 14 T, increased by a factor of 2 compared to that for the normal MgB2 wires. The best Jc results for a 10 at% Mg excess sample were obtained by heating the sample for 1 h at 600 &#9702;C, resulting in Jc for a field of  8 T and a temperature of 10 K that reached 3 &#215; 104 A/cm2. A detailed analysis of the effects of excess Mg on the microstructures, the Jc, and the Hirr of MgB2/Fe wires is presented in this thesis.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/829</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mangrove and saltmarsh surface elevation dynamics in relation to environmental variables in Southeastern Australia|</field><field name="creator">Rogers, Kerrylee</field><field name="description">Research has demonstrated that at many sites in Southeastern Australia, there have been changes in the extent of mangrove and saltmarsh communities over the past five decades. In particular, this has been characterised by encroachment of saltmarsh by mangrove. Changes in the relationship between marsh elevation and water levels, facilitated either by altered tidal regimes, eustatic sea-level rise or marsh subsidence/autocompaction, have been hypothesised as the driver of these community-scale changes. In addition, the evidence for future sea-level rise is compelling and abundant. However, our understanding of marsh sedimentary and elevation dynamics in relation to sea-level and the impacts of sea-level rise on mangrove and saltmarsh in Southeastern Australia is limited. The aim of this study was to examine marsh elevation trajectories in relation to sea-level change, establish the contribution of sedimentation to these changes and determine the vulnerability of mangrove and saltmarsh to submergence from sea-level rise.This research has been carried out over approximately 1 500 km of coastline and at wide range of sites in Southeastern Australia, including the Tweed River, Hunter River, Hawkesbury River, Parramatta River, Minnamurra River, Jervis Bay and Western Port Bay. Photogrammetric mapping of mangrove and saltmarsh extent was compiled for each study site and tidal inundation models were developed to determine the vertical and horizontal change in mangrove and saltmarsh extent since the commencement of aerial photography. A network of Surface Elevation Tables was established to examine marsh elevation trajectories in relation to sea-level changes and determine the environmental variables influencing marsh elevation. Feldspar marker horizons were established in mangrove and saltmarsh to examine contemporary sediment accretion trajectories and determine the contribution of sedimentation to marsh elevation. Sediment cores from saltmarshes in Western Port Bay were 210Pb dated to establish historic sedimentation rates and make comparisons with sea-level changes. To ascertain whether mangrove and saltmarsh distribution changes were related to sea-level rise, sedimentation and/or subsidence, comparisons were made between changes in vegetation extent, sedimentation, marsh elevation changes and sea-level changes.Contemporary rates of sediment accretion varied greatly, but generally agreed with historic rates of sedimentation determined for the past 100 years at Western Port Bay. Inundation frequency, tidal range and geomorphology were all shown to influence sediment accretion at study sites. Surface elevation changes were strongly correlated to El Ni&#241;o intensity (Southern Oscillation Index) and rainfall. Mean sedimentation contributed to approximately 67% of surface elevation change in saltmarsh settings and 51% in mangrove settings. A consistent relationship between sediment accretion and surface elevation changes was not observed.At most study sites sediment accretion exceeded surface elevation changes due to subsurface processes causing subsidence/autocompaction. The bulk of subsidence was attributed to reduced rainfall in association with the 2002 to 2004 El Ni&#241;o related drought, which was shown to cause groundwater reserves to be depleted. Surface elevation exceeded sediment accretion in the saltmarsh at three study sites and this was attributed to ponding of surface water causing sediments to swell due to porewater storage increases, and increased primary productivity and associated belowground root development that displaced the marsh surface. Rates of sediment accretion generally kept pace with or exceeded sea-level changes, However, since subsurface processes of subsidence/autocompaction and uplift influenced marsh elevations, it was more appropriate to determine mangrove and saltmarsh vulnerability to sea-level rise on the basis of an elevation deficit, defined as the difference between rates of marsh elevation change and sea-level change over the same study period. Elevation deficits indicated that the vulnerability of mangrove and saltmarsh in Southeastern Australia to submergence was low.Submergence may not be the only possible impact of sea-level rise on mangrove and saltmarsh communities. No relationship was found between mangrove increase and sedimentation or saltmarsh decline and sedimentation. However, a significant relationship was established between rates of surface elevation change in the saltmarsh and rates of mangrove area increase. By determining the vertical gradient over which mangrove had increased extent and relative sea-level rise, which incorporates mangrove surface elevation changes and eustatic sea-level rise, a significant correlation was found between relative sea-level rise and the vertical component of landward mangrove encroachment. Observed changes to mangrove and saltmarsh extent in Southeastern Australia over the past 50 years were attributed to subsidence and sea-level rise.Several sedimentation and surface elevation trends in Southeastern Australia were typical of marshes within the international SET network. Sedimentation was equivalent to surface elevation change at few sites and marsh elevations were typically influenced by subsidence. Mangrove sediment accretion may also be globally predicted on the basis of tide range and long-term sea-level rise at study sites. However, marsh surface dynamics in Southeastern Australia differ from global trends due to the upper intertidal location of saltmarshes, the strong influence of drought on marsh elevations and generally lower rates of sea-level rise.The results of this study have important implications for current estuary management practices. For example, interference with natural sediment movements within estuaries by trapping sediments and associated nutrients upstream may actually reduce sediment availability to mangrove and saltmarsh communities and increase their vulnerability to the impacts of sea-level rise. Also, the finding that groundwater plays an important role in maintaining marsh surface elevation has implications on the management of groundwater resources and the role of climate change on the longterm survival of mangrove and saltmarsh communities.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/653</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Systematics of the Australasian Lymnaeidae</field><field name="creator">Puslednik, Louise</field><field name="description">The Lymnaeidae Rafinesque, 1815 are one of the most widespread groups of freshwater snails, however, they are characterised by a long and confused systematic history largely due to problems associated with shell plasticity. Recent molecular studies that have utilised DNA sequences have failed to adequately represent the Australasian lymnaeids. The aim of this study was to understand the systematics of the Australasian Lymnaeidae, using 16S and ITS-2 sequences in tandem with a anatomical and shell studies.The native Australian and New Zealand lymnaeids are currently attributed to Austropeplea Cotton, 1942 and Kutikina Ponder and Waterhouse 1997, which are thought to be represented by three and one species, respectively. Results of this study indicate there are 5 distinct species across three genera. Phylogenetic analyses of the A. tomentosa (Pfeiffer, 1855) complex recovered two distinct species, A. tomentosa in New Zealand and A. huonensis (Tenison-Woods, 1876) in southern Australia. There was however incongruence between the anatomical and molecular phylogenies.  Kutikina hispida was suggested to be closely related to the A. tomentosa complex, however, molecular phylogenies genes resolved K. hispida as sister to A. huonensis, with A. tomentosa being resolved as sister to the A. huonensis + Kutikina clade.  Kutikina was therefore synonymised into Austropeplea based on the molecular phylogenies. Based on molecular and anatomical phylogenies, the more northern complex, A. lessoni (Deshayes, 1830) was more appropriately placed in the Peplimnea (Iredale, 1943), and was found to be represented by two distinct taxa, P. lessoni and P. affinis (K&#252;ster, 1862). Phylogenetic analysis of 16S, ITS-2 and anatomical characters recovered A. viridis (Quoy and Gaimard, 1832) as relatively divergent from other members of Austropeplea. Therefore, A. viridis was placed into Viridigalba Kruglov and Starobogatov, 1985. Using 16S sequences and anatomical characters, a phylogeny of the Lymnaeidae was produced. The Australasian lymnaeids represented one of the most derived groups within the family in both the 16S and anatomical phylogenies. The North American and European lymnaeids were resolved at the base of the lymnaeid phylogeny, suggesting that these taxa represent the older groups within the family.Phylogenies based on molecular sequences suggest that the Austropeplea lessoni complex is more closely related to lymnaeids from South East Asia than to other Australian lymnaeids. Furthermore, based on molecular and anatomical phylogenies, A. viridis is suggested as sister to the A. tomentosa complex. Therefore it is highly likely the A. lessoni complex and A. tomentosa complex have separate derivations.  The monophyly of Radix Montfort, 1810 remains however unresolved.Two theories of biogeography of the Australasian Lymnaeidae have been recently proposed and were examined in light of the new phylogeny. While it seems certain that the Austropeplea lessoni complex had a South East Asian origin, the origin of the A. tomentosa complex is still unclear. The close relationship of the A. tomentosa complex with Asian A. viridis plus the derived position of the group in the family, suggest a second invasion of Australia by lymnaeids from South East Asia. However, the basal position of the New Zealand A. tomentosa would suggest the group occurred here first and moved into Australia, thus suggesting a Gondwanan radiation of the A. tomentosa complex. The discovery of a lymnaeid fossil in Antarctica lends further weight to this theory.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/815</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The exact transmission of texts in the first millennium BCE - an examination of the cuneiform evidence from Mesopotamia and the Torah scrolls from the western shore of the Dead Sea</field><field name="creator">Hobson, Russell</field><field name="description">PhD</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Dead Sea scrolls</field><field name="subject">Bible</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/5404</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">"You'll never walk alone" The use of brand equity frameworks to explore the team identification of the 'satellite supporter'.</field><field name="creator">Kerr, Anthony Keith</field><field name="description">Globalisation and advances in communications technology have greatly expanded the potential marketplace for professional teams, especially for internationally popular sports. Lewis (2001) claimed that fans are now more likely to support a team based less on a shared geographic connection than on personal reasons. As Ben-Porat (2000) claimed, for these fans a foreign-based team is like &#8220;an 'overseas sweetheart,' far away but close to the heart&#8221; (p. 344). These 'satellite supporters,' (Kerr 2008, in press), or 'satellite fans' (Kerr &amp; Gladden 2008) represent significant revenue, especially for those team brands that seek international expansion. In addition, an individual's decision to purchase the sports product is largely dependent upon their level of identification with a chosen team. Team identification, or &#8220;the extent to which a fan feels psychologically connected&#8221; (Wann, Melnick, Russell &amp; Pease 2001, p. 3) to a particular team, is critical to the financial viability of a sports organisation. However, despite the increased attention paid to team identification, the reasons why satellite supporters identify with a foreign-based team have been largely unexplored. To address this need this study asks: What are the most important antecedents in the identification of satellite supporters with their chosen sports team? Recent research also suggests that a relationship exists between team identification and brand equity (Carlson, Quazi &amp; Muthaly 2002; Kerr 2008; Underwood, Bond &amp; Baer 2001). Therefore, the study also asks: Can a conceptual brand equity framework predict the determinants of team identification of satellite supporters? The thesis adopts a case study approach using mixed methods; a strategy that can provide &#8220;a fuller understanding of the sports fan&#8221; (Jones 1997b). Online questionnaires and semi-structured interviews were administered to members of fan organisations dedicated to the English Premier League's Liverpool F.C. Liverpool F.C. was an appropriate subject for the case study as it has a global fan base, a rich history, and is arguably one of the world's premier team brands. This thesis proposes a number of important antecedents in the satellite supporter's identification with a foreign-based team. These are: media coverage; style of play; the presence of particular player(s); team success; history of success; participation in the highest division; stadium; history of ethical behaviour; and the broadcast quality of games. Furthermore, a conceptual brand equity framework is shown to shed light on the possible determinants of their team identification. This study also confirms that social identity theory is an appropriate perspective to examine foreign fandom; satellite supporters might derive positive psychological benefits from their fandom; and the existence of a brand community dedicated to a professional sports organisation.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Team identification.</field><field name="subject">Sports teams.</field><field name="subject">Liverpool Football Club.</field><field name="subject">Brand equity.</field><field name="subject">Sports fans.</field><field name="subject">Satellite fans.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/887</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Unpredictable predictables: complexity theory and the construction of order in intensive care.</field><field name="creator">Carroll, Katherine Emily</field><field name="description">The Intensive Care Unit (ICU) is a unit that manages the most critically ill, complex and unstable patients in the hospital. As a result, the ICU is characterised by a high degree of clinical and organisational unpredictability and uncertainty. In Western discourse, uncertainty is often portrayed as problematic, and as something to be controlled and reduced. This research challenges this discourse by examining the productive relationship between certainty and uncertainty in the work practices of ICU clinicians, and subsequently, how intensive care clinicians utilise uncertainty to construct order in a highly unpredictable work environment. To understand how order can coexist with ICU&#8217;s unremitting unpredictability, complexity theory is used to frame this investigation. This research engaged an emergent, interventionist methodology, deploying multiple methods. Using ethnography, video-ethnography, and video-reflexivity, this research relied on clinicians&#8217; participation in the construction and analysis of video data of the ICU clinicians&#8217; work practices. This resulted in clinician-led practice change in the ICU. This research suggests that methods need to be deployed adaptively in order to deal with the complexity of ICU, in addition to the moment-to-moment emergence of events that require the researcher&#8217;s own work plans to be revisited. Moreover, in order to gain traction with, and understand highly complex and changeable environments, the researcher needs to also enter and experience uncertainty herself. Using complexity theory as its analytical tool, this research shows an inseparability of uncertainty and certainty in the ICU which is labeled &#8216;un/certainty&#8217;. Three main conclusions emerge from this research. First, un/certainty predominates in intensive care, and due to this, ordering is a process rather than a final state. Un/certainty is at the heart of the adaptive practices that clinicians enact. These adaptive practices are highly interconnected to the changes that the ICU environment may require, and thus produce a dynamic order in the unit. Second, the researcher herself, in order to come to terms with the complexity and un/certainty of the ICU environment must also enter un/certainty in order to gain traction with the ICU environment: unpredictability and complexity cannot be studied from a neat and disengaged distance. Third, the presence of un/certainty in the ICU can be significant and enabling rather than disabling for clinicians in their ongoing pursuit of dynamically ordering practice. The contribution of un/certainty to frontline practice is as a central driver to managing change and complexity. Therefore it should be positively revalued by health services researchers, policy makers and clinicians alike.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Complexity theory.</field><field name="subject">Intensive care units.</field><field name="subject">Uncertainty.</field><field name="subject">Video ethnography.</field><field name="subject">Video reflexivity.</field><field name="subject">ICU clinicians.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/899</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">ICTs for whose development?  A critical analysis of the discourses surrounding an ICT for Development Initiative for a group of microenterprise entrepreneurs operating in the Jamaican tourism industry: Towards the development of methodologies and analytical tools for understanding and explaining the ICT for Development Phenomenon</field><field name="creator">Waller, Lloyd George</field><field name="description">This is an interdiscliplinary qualitative study which uses an exploratory research design and builds on Fariclough's Critical Discourse Analysis methodology to analyze the discourses surrounding an Information and Communication Technology (ICT) for livelihood development project in Jamaica, introduced by the United Nations Development Programme - the Jamaica Sustainable Development Networking Programme (JSDNP). The primary objective of this project is to provide the poor in Jamaican communities with access to, and training in ICTs.  In this research, I specifically focus on the discourses surrounding the JSDNP Cybercentre Project for a group of microenterprise entrepreneurs in the Jamaican tourism industry to access the epistemological assumptions of this project. From the data collected it was found that at one level, the JSDNP Cybercentre Project encouraged specific ways of acting and organizing congruent with the configurations, processes and structures of corporate firms of industrialized countries, by representing the achievement of livelihood expansion through the use of specific ICTs in a particular way which excluded other discourses. The particular ways of acting and organizing promoted by the Cybercentre encouraged the use of non-indigenous technologies, undervalued indigenous technologies and excluded the indigenization of non-indigenous technologies.  These discourses were incompatible with the operational and structural configurations of trans-temporal poor entrepretrepreneurs interviewed and were more favourable to the non-poor and spatio-temporal ones. One of the wider implications of the discourse therefore was that they play a fundamental role in perpetuating entrenched inequalities through the preservation of social practices, along with their associated systems and structures.  It was also found that these modalities limited the operational processes of all microenterprise entrepreneurs who were exposed to the Cybercentre Project. These entrepreneurs have limited control over the configuration of non-indigenous technologies; their technological and creative capabilities are restricted; their ability to indigenize non-indigenous technologies impaired; and they are highly dependent on non-indigenous technologies (which themselves have a number of limitations).</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Lloyd George Waller</field><field name="subject">Norman Girvan</field><field name="subject">technology</field><field name="subject">digital divide</field><field name="subject">Information and Communication Technology</field><field name="subject">ICT development</field><field name="subject">discourse</field><field name="subject">critical theory</field><field name="subject">discourse analysis</field><field name="subject">critical discourse analysis</field><field name="subject">CDA</field><field name="subject">Fairclough</field><field name="subject">tourism</field><field name="subject">Jamaica Sustainable Development Networking Programme</field><field name="subject">JSCNP</field><field name="subject">United Nations Development Programme</field><field name="subject">UNDP</field><field name="subject">Jamaica</field><field name="subject">microenterprise</field><field name="subject">entrepreneurs</field><field name="subject">methodology</field><field name="subject">ICT</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10289/2628</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Structural condition monitoring and damage identification with artificial neural network</field><field name="creator">Bakhary, Norhisham</field><field name="description">Many methods have been developed and studied to detect damage through the change of dynamic response of a structure. Due to its capability to recognize pattern and to correlate non-linear and non-unique problem, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) have received increasing attention for use in detecting damage in structures based on vibration modal parameters. Most successful works reported in the application of ANN for damage detection are limited to numerical examples and small controlled experimental examples only. This is because of the two main constraints for its practical application in detecting damage in real structures. They are: 1) the inevitable existence of uncertainties in vibration measurement data and finite element modeling of the structure, which may lead to erroneous prediction of structural conditions; and 2) enormous computational effort required to reliably train an ANN model when it involves structures with many degrees of freedom. Therefore, most applications of ANN in damage detection are limited to structure systems with a small number of degrees of freedom and quite significant damage levels. In this thesis, a probabilistic ANN model is proposed to include into consideration the uncertainties in finite element model and measured data. Rossenblueth's point estimate method is used to reduce the calculations in training and testing the probabilistic ANN model. The accuracy of the probabilistic model is verified by Monte Carlo simulations. Using the probabilistic ANN model, the statistics of the stiffness parameters can be predicted which are used to calculate the probability of damage existence (PDE) in each structural member. The reliability and efficiency of this method is demonstrated using both numerical and experimental examples. In addition, a parametric study is carried out to investigate the sensitivity of the proposed method to different damage levels and to different uncertainty levels. As an ANN model requires enormous computational effort in training the ANN model when the number of degrees of freedom is relatively large, a substructuring approach employing multi-stage ANN is proposed to tackle the problem. Through this method, a structure is divided to several substructures and each substructure is assessed separately with independently trained ANN model for the substructure. Once the damaged substructures are identified, second-stage ANN models are trained for these substructures to identify the damage locations and severities of the structural ii element in the substructures. Both the numerical and experimental examples are used to demonstrate the probabilistic multi-stage ANN methods. It is found that this substructuring ANN approach greatly reduces the computational effort while increasing the damage detectability because fine element mesh can be used. It is also found that the probabilistic model gives better damage identification than the deterministic approach. A sensitivity analysis is also conducted to investigate the effect of substructure size, support condition and different uncertainty levels on the damage detectability of the proposed method. The results demonstrated that the detectibility level of the proposed method is independent of the structure type, but dependent on the boundary condition, substructure size and uncertainty level.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Civil engineering -- Data processing</field><field name="subject">Computational intelligence</field><field name="subject">Computer-aided engineering</field><field name="subject">Neural networks (Computer science)</field><field name="subject">Structural analysis (Engineering) -- Data processing</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2009.0102</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Provenance establishment and authentication of South-East Asian ceramics using laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS)</field><field name="creator">Bartle, Emma Kathleen</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] The sale of fraudulent South-East Asian ceramics constitutes a large proportion of the illegal artefact and antique trade and threatens to undermine the legitimate international market. The sophistication and skill of forgers has reached a level where, using traditional appraisal by eye and hand, even the most experienced specialist is often unable to distinguish between a genuine and fraudulent piece. In addition, the current scientific method of authentication used by the international antiques and art industry, thermoluminescence (TL) dating, carries severe limitations. The technique has an error margin of +/-20 % and requires the removal of a significant piece of the sample being tested, which decreases both the monetary and cultural value of the artefact. Of more concern, forgers have developed methods which produce false test results and which appear to corroborate false claims for the age of artefacts. Consequently, the use of TL dating for authentication of ancient ceramics, especially those of South-East Asian origin, has now come into serious question. The most suitable method for authenticating ceramics is through provenance establishment. Studies published in the literature have investigated the application of various analytical techniques to provide this information for ceramic wares and have highlighted their potential to be used for provenance establishment. However, the value of each of these techniques is limited rendering them generally unsuitable for practical use in the international antiques and art world to authenticate high-value South-East Asian artefacts. Consequently, there is a desperate need for the development of a robust, accurate and non-destructive method which can be practically applied in the industry to authenticate South-East Asian ceramics. ... Minor variations between spectral profiles of artefacts produced in the same country have also been used to further provenance artefacts to a specific production region or kiln site.

In modern urban life especially, rational order is presented as destructive of a playful orientation towards life eschewing mystery through coherence, spontaneity through predictability, and contingency through systematic planning. In turn, the postmodern debate often asserts the reinvigoration of free, playful, and contingent individuals whose collective acts are destructive of the rationality of modern order with the present, in contrast to the past, offering a condition of enduring and unremitting uncertainty. This thesis explores the dynamic relation between rational order and play in urban society through an ethnographic account of a public commuter railway in Perth, Western Australia. Notwithstanding this ethnographic setting, the thesis addresses questions of broader significance through an analysis of the railway as an instance of public space and state techno-bureaucratic order. I investigate the creative process through which the state attempts to standardise the various operational components of the railway as well as the reasons underpinning the state's desire to produce what I term a 'clean machine'. In turn, I investigate how differentially positioned actors live within this carefully crafted machine. I do so by following the stories, experiences, and practices of: government administrators charged with building the railway; the managers who oversee the network's operation; the staff members who operate trains, clean stations, and discipline passengers; and the railway's end-users, including passengers and graffiti artists. ...  In examining the two tensions of rational order/play and revelation/ concealment, I attempt to explicate how it is that people experience life as simultaneously coherent and serendipitous. In the thesis, I document the ways in which railway officials, passengers, and graffiti artists express a pervasive ambivalence towards their experience of the railway system. On the one hand, these actors experience the railway as a system of constraint that produces 'robotic' behaviours and automated transactions. On the other, they see the railway as a liberating space that enables autonomous expression and spontaneous interaction. By examining these contending experiences and associated sentiments, I highlight the railway as a stimulating site within which to explore the meaning and significance of urban modernity. Lastly, this thesis contributes to debate on the challenges posed by the character of contemporary social processes to anthropological research methodology. I illustrate the utility of such methods as written and photographic diaries as well as mental-mapping exercises, but primarily advocate the documentary and analytical advantages of participant observation in a mobile field-site. I assert that while participant observation poses a number of personal and professional challenges in this setting, these challenges uncover the stimulating complexity of contemporary urban life. To this end, I contest emergent academic commentary that propounds the destabilisation of anthropological techniques in what is frequently described as an equally destabilised world.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Flaneurs -- Social aspects</field><field name="subject">Geographical perception -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Railroads -- Social aspects -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Railroads -- Western Australia -- Social life and customs</field><field name="subject">Sociology, Urban -- Western Australia -- Perth</field><field name="subject">Modernity</field><field name="subject">Rational order</field><field name="subject">Bureaucracy</field><field name="subject">Graffiti</field><field name="subject">Simmel</field><field name="subject">Anonymity</field><field name="subject">Anthropology/Sociology</field><field name="subject">Ethnography</field><field name="subject">Fl&#226;neur</field><field name="subject">Social interaction</field><field name="subject">Public space</field><field name="subject">Play</field><field name="subject">Railway</field><field name="subject">Urban relations/City</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2009.0106</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Challenges in international business communication : a study of language, culture and inter-cultural issues in Malaysian-Australian business discourse</field><field name="creator">Ismail, Jumiati</field><field name="description">This study aims to explore communication deviances and strategies in the negotiation discourse of Malaysian-Australian business encounters, from both a linguistic and nonlinguistic perspective. Specifically, it sees miscommunications/deviances as factors that may hinder the business communication process and prevent the negotiators from achieving their objectives. The study also focuses on strategies, or those discourse skills which promote successful business negotiation. The research method is based on the analysis of discourse generated from initial 'perception' interviews, business meetings, and post-meeting 'follow-up' interviews. The research involved a cross-section of Malaysian and Australian business people from various industries; such as tourism, information technology, hospitality and financial services. The initial 'perception' interviews were intended to gather data on the prior experiences of Malaysian and Australian businesspeople, both in terms of the reported difficulties and strengths in their business interactions and dealings in Western Australia. In the second stage of the analysis, the deviances which signalled miscommunication in the negotiation were identified in the recorded meeting data. Also identified were the strategies which were used by the negotiators to increase the likelihood that their goals will be achieved. The objective of the research was then to interpret why these strategies were being used, and their influence on the negotiation process. From the data a pattern emerged in the way that deviance occurred, and the way that strategies were being performed. This has made it possible to group deviance and strategies and present the findings thematically. Altogether, five themes identified, these were: Management of topics, Building rapport; Ethical business conduct; Building recognition; Styles in business practice. The study has shown that business communication discourse reflects the embedded culture of its speakers. Topic management was also found to play an important role in the business meetings as it enabled the participants to more effectively lead their discussion towards its intended goal. Both the deviance and strategies have been managed by the business negotiators in the way they select the appropriate topic categories in order to effectively maintain the discussion throughout the meeting.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Business communication</field><field name="subject">Business etiquette -- Australia</field><field name="subject">Business etiquette -- Malaysia</field><field name="subject">Corporate culture</field><field name="subject">Intercultural communication</field><field name="subject">National characteristics</field><field name="subject">Negotiation in business</field><field name="subject">Malaysian-Australian business discourse</field><field name="subject">International business communication</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2009.0107</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Students diagnosed with AD/HD and their first year at university : a theory of developing empowerment</field><field name="creator">Toner, Michele Eva</field><field name="description">The past decade has witnessed students with disabilities attending university in everincreasing numbers. In particular, many countries, including Australia, now report that students with so-called 'invisible disabilities' comprise the vast majority of those seeking support from Student Disability Services at university. Despite this increase, relatively few researchers have investigated the processes involved in the university education of students with disabilities, particularly during their crucial first year, when the highest rate of student attrition occurs across the board. The substantial body of research which has investigated the 'first year experience' for university students in Australia and the United States of America has ignored the issues unique to students with disabilities during this critical period. At the same time, some researchers, predominantly in the United States of America and the United Kingdom, have studied the tertiary education of students with disabilities. However, the subject has received less attention in Australia. Also, certain categories of university students with disabilities have been overlooked. In particular, university students diagnosed with Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (AD/HD) appear to be one of the groups that have attracted little attention worldwide, despite the vast body of research that exists on children and, increasingly, on adults with the diagnosis. These students constituted the focus of the study reported in this thesis. The aim of this study was to develop substantive theory about how university students who are diagnosed with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (AD/HD) deal with their first year. The study is conceptualised within the social theory of symbolic interactionism. A central research question and a series of related guiding questions were used as the starting point for data collection. Data collection was conducted largely through in-depth, individual, face-to-face semistructured interviews, and participant observation consistent with the interpretivist qualitative research tradition. In addition, informal interviews, telephone interviews and documents provided supplementary data for the study. Data analysis, which occurred concurrently with data collection, employed the open coding method consistent with the grounded theory model and the development and testing of propositions. The central proposition of the substantive theory generated from this study is that students diagnosed with AD/HD experience a sense of developing empowerment as they progress through three stages in their first year at university. The first stage in the theory of developing empowerment is entitled the development of empowerment through realising a dream. The second stage is entitled the development of empowerment through becoming proactive. The final stage is entitled the development of empowerment through the feeling of belonging. The theory of developing empowerment provides a new perspective on how university students with a diagnosis of AD/HD deal with their first year of study. A number of implications for further theory development, policy and practice are drawn from it. There are also several recommendations for further research.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Attention-deficit disorder in adults</field><field name="subject">Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder</field><field name="subject">College students</field><field name="subject">Power (Social sciences)</field><field name="subject">Self-actualization (Psychology)</field><field name="subject">Symbolic interactionism</field><field name="subject">Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity disorder</field><field name="subject">ADHD</field><field name="subject">University students</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2009.0108</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Family law dispute resolution : procedural justice and the lawyer-client interaction</field><field name="creator">Howieson, Jillian Alice</field><field name="description">While several Australian and international studies have explored the family lawyer-client interaction, these studies have been limited to investigations of discrete areas of the lawyerclient relationship and have been necessarily limited in their methodologies. The present study employed a quantitative empirical methodology in an Australian wide field study of 230 family lawyers and 94 clients that investigated the family lawyer-client interaction from a procedural justice framework. Using multivariate analyses, the study establishes that the Tyler and Blader two-component model of procedural justice applies in the lawyer-client dyad and is influenced by the approach of the lawyer, the emotional response of the client, and the level of co-party conflict that the client is experiencing. Further, the study gives meaning to the terms 'conciliatory and constructive' and 'adversarial' as they apply to family law dispute resolution. The study establishes a construct to measure the conciliatory and adversarial approach of family lawyers and identifies that lawyers tend to incorporate a mixture of the two into their work. The results also identify four distinct behavioural factors that characterise the two approaches: the client-centred and interest-based factors characterise the conciliatory approach; and the lawyer-directed and court-focused factors characterise the adversarial. The study found that in terms of perceptions of fairness, and feelings of satisfaction, the clients preferred the lawyers who took a client-centred and interest-based approach, but in circumstances where the clients were experiencing high-levels of conflict, or fear for the safety of their children, they also appreciated the lawyer who was lawyer-directed and court-focused. Overall, the study shows that in order to create a fair and satisfying dispute resolution service for their clients, family lawyers need to maintain a fine balance of family lawyering behaviour. On a general level, the study provides a profile of Australian family lawyers in terms of their approach to dispute resolution, their attitude towards ADR processes and their favoured negotiation styles. It also profiles family law clients in terms of their emotional adjustment to the divorce and their perceptions of the family lawyers assisting them to resolve their disputes. The study substantially expands the procedural justice theory base and has significant implications for practical family law education, government policy, family lawyering, and the ADR and collaborative law movements. The study indicates where future research could benefit these communities.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Attorney and client -- Australia</field><field name="subject">Confidential communications -- Lawyers -- Australia</field><field name="subject">Dispute resolution (Law) -- Australia</field><field name="subject">Domestic relations -- Australia</field><field name="subject">Family law -- Australia</field><field name="subject">Parent and child (Law) -- Australia</field><field name="subject">Procedure (Law) -- Australia</field><field name="subject">Family lawyers</field><field name="subject">Procedural justice</field><field name="subject">Alternative dispute resolution</field><field name="subject">Negotiation styles</field><field name="subject">Family law clients</field><field name="subject">Lawyer-client interaction</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2009.0109</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Spectroscopic identification of complex species containing water and ammonia and their importance to icy outer solar system bodies</field><field name="creator">Ennis, Courtney</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] This thesis examines the bonding interactions and chemical processes associated with irradiated water (H2O) and ammonia (NH3) molecules. The experiments conducted in the present study are designed to replicate the surface chemistry of outer Solar System bodies, particularly the icy surfaces of Saturn's inner moons. Infrared (IR) spectroscopy is used to identify the H2ONH3 complex isolated in an argon (Ar) matrix. An electric discharge is then applied to the H2O and NH3 species to produce the hydroxyl-ammonia (OHNH3) complex and the water-amidogen (H2ONH2) complex. Finally, the ammonia-oxygen (NH3O2) complex is formed in an Ar matrix, complementing previous studies performed by the Quickenden research group, which investigated the conversion of OH radicals into molecular O2 on icy planetary surfaces. ... An electric discharge is applied to the NH3 in Ar mixture, producing the NH2 radical subunit of the complex. Two absorption bands are assigned to the H2O subunit vibrational frequencies of the complex; at 1616.1 cm-1 for the &#191;2 HOH bending fundamental and at 3532.1 cm-1 for the &#191;1 OH bonded stretching fundamental. Two absorption bands are also assigned to the NH2 radical subunit vibrational frequencies of the complex; at 1498.5 cm-1 for the &#191;2 HNH bending fundamental and at 3260.8 cm-1 for the &#191;3 NH asymmetric stretching fundamental. These assignments are verified by the isotope substitution method, involving the formation of the deuterated D2OND2 complex analogue in an Ar matrix and the measurement of the isotope induced shifts in peak position in the IR region. The isotopic shifts displayed by the IR absorption bands are in good agreement with the theoretically calculated shifts in vibration frequency when going from the H2ONH2 complex fundamentals to the D2OND2 complex fundamentals. The theoretical calculations also derived an interaction energy of 5.2 kcal mol-1 for the HOHNH2 structure of the H2ONH2 complex. This HOHNH2 structure is also confirmed as the preferred structure of the H2ONH2 complex in the IR experiments, by the observation of a large shift in position of the absorption band associated with the H2O subunit &#191;1 OH stretching fundamental, away from the position of the H2O monomer &#191;1 OH stretching fundamental. This indicates that the H2O subunit donates a hydrogen for the complex bond in the HOHNH2 complex. The NH3O2 complex is identified in solid Ar matrices at 10.5 K by IR analysis. The NH3O2 complex is formed by the co-deposition of gaseous NH3 in Ar mixtures with O2 in Ar gas mixtures. An absorption band is assigned to the &#191;1 OO stretching fundamental for the O2 subunit of the NH3O2 complex at 1552.0 cm-1. This assignment is verified by the isotope substitution method, involving the formation of the deuterated ND3O2 complex analogue in an Ar matrix and the measurement of the isotope induced shift in peak position in the IR region. The isotopic shift displayed by the IR absorption band is in good agreement with the theoretically calculated shift in vibration frequency when going from the NH3O2 complex fundamental to the ND3O2 complex fundamental. The theoretical calculations also derived an interaction energy of 0.28 kcal mol-1 for the NH3O2 complex.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Ammonia</field><field name="subject">Atmospheric chemistry</field><field name="subject">Infrared spectroscopy</field><field name="subject">Matrix isolation spectroscopy</field><field name="subject">Solar system</field><field name="subject">Saturn (Planet) -- Ring system</field><field name="subject">Spectroscopy</field><field name="subject">Matrix isolation</field><field name="subject">Water-Amidogen radical complex</field><field name="subject">Planetary ices</field><field name="subject">Saturn and the Saturnian satellites</field><field name="subject">Ammonia-hydroxy radical complex</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2009.0110</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigation of blood dynamics : surface flow and droplet stain morphology on fabrics</field><field name="creator">Nik Mohamed, Nik Elena</field><field name="description">This thesis is divided into two parts, each of which examines aspects of bloodstain analysis where gravity is the main force applied to blood. Part I is a preliminary study on the dynamics of blood flow on various inclined surfaces and examines the use of blood analogs for easy test replication. The flow of uncoagulated human blood at different volumes and temperatures was examined on wood at a set angle of 1.5&#176;, and on glass at varying incline angles. Glycerol solutions of 59% and 42% were used to represent blood at 23&#176;C and 37&#176;C respectively. Glycerol flow trials of similar volumes were conducted on wood, PVC and glass. Fluid flow plots of distance versus time exhibited double exponential curve behaviour, although a power-law relationship derived by H. E. Huppert's (1982) flow expression was obtained for blood flowing on inclined wood. Blood flow exhibited several observable characteristics; a decreasing width of the leading edge over time, and streaking and component separation of the leading region at very low speeds. On a glass surface, the width of the initial flow region decreased and initial speed increased with increasing angles. The glycerol analogs used in this study did not represent their blood counterparts well due to differences in physical properties of the fluids. Part II of this study focuses on the forensic value of passive bloodstains on three fabrics; 100% cotton drill, 65/35 polyester cotton, and 100% Shantung silk. 26 &#181;L drops of 37&#176;C human blood were deposited onto the three fabrics and paper from a height of 14 cm at various impact angles. The stains were photographed and analysed qualitatively and quantitatively using computational methods. 100% cotton drill, 65/35 polyester cotton and ironed 100% Shantung silk provided useful forensic values such as direction of travel and angle of impact.

Intermittent, dryland streams are highly dynamic environments subject to unpredictable and sporadic flow. Natural disturbance from lengthy drought periods and sudden floods are typical for these systems. Without adequate baselines for natural disturbances, it is difficult to quantify other effects from anthropogenic disturbance such as dewatering, land clearing, and urbanisation, or climate change. This thesis presents work from a four-year study examining the biogeochemistry of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and carbon (C) in soils and sediments of two intermittent streams (Barnett Creek and Pirraburdoo Creek) in the Pilbara region of north-west Australia. The Pilbara is an area of ancient geology and highly weathered environments that is undergoing rapid development yet is poorly understood from an ecological perspective. The principal objectives of this thesis were to determine: i) how flooding affects the spatiotemporal patterns of nutrients in intermittent stream landscapes; ii) the role of flooding in N and C mineralisation and microbial dynamics; and iii) the connections between benthic algae, microbes and nutrient availability in channel sediments. To address these objectives, three field studies and two incubation experiments were conducted. Field studies at Barnett Creek indicated that flooding reduced the spatial heterogeneity of available soil nutrients and microbes in the stream landscape, and that topography (relative elevation) in the stream landscape was of less importance in influencing nutrient and microbial patterns than flooding or landscape position.  ... Field studies at Pirraburdoo Creek indicated that microbial biomass and activity increased in benthic algal mats during mat senescent stages, and decreased after flooding when mat biomass peaked. Benthic algae grew rapidly in gravel run environments after flooding, while declining in pools, and demonstrated moderate N limitation and strong P limitation. Pools had two to eight times greater NO3-N, three to five times more total N, and two to three times more labile P, OC and total C than either pools after flooding, or runs before or after flooding. Hence, the pools at Pirraburdoo Creek represented a local, interflood store of nutrients in otherwise nutrient-poor landscape, when connectivity to upstream reaches or upland environments was weak or non-existent. This thesis provides the first detailed analysis of soil and sediment biogeochemical responses to flooding for intermittent streams in the Pilbara region and for semi-arid Australia. Further pressing questions raised by this work include: What is the key pulse size and frequency for maintaining Pilbara riparian communities as well as soil microbial function? How do the spatio-temporal nutrient and microbial patterns observed persist over (i) multi-decadal scales, (ii) mega-spatial (larger landscape to regional) scales, (iii) different flood frequency-magnitude regimes, and (iv) different stream sizes? Stream biogeochemistry is a burgeoning field, and it is therefore reasonable to expect such existing gaps in knowledge may be addressed in the near future.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Arid regions -- Western Australia -- Pilbara</field><field name="subject">Biogeochemistry</field><field name="subject">Sediment transport</field><field name="subject">Soil biochemistry</field><field name="subject">Soils -- Western Australia -- Pilbara</field><field name="subject">Pilbara (W.A.)</field><field name="subject">Pilbara</field><field name="subject">Biogeochemistry</field><field name="subject">Nutrients</field><field name="subject">Rivers</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2009.0115</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Young children's fast food brand knowledge, preference and equity</field><field name="creator">Lambert, Claire</field><field name="description">Today's children are a multi-billion dollar consumer market that not only has the power to spend their own money but directly influences the spending for household consumer purchases. They present an extremely healthy and potentially long term wealthy consumer market for marketers to target and reap the benefits from their loyalty. However, the area of young children's consumer behaviour is significantly under researched. Very little is known about how young children develop preferences, make brand choices, and develop equity towards a brand. This study investigates the brand knowledge elements associated with brand preference and brand equity for young children. An experimental procedure was employed utilising personal interviews and collecting data from five Australian Day Care facilities and four Australian Community Pre-school Centres. The respondents were three and four year old children, who performed a game involving questions about fast food brands. The hypotheses explored various aspects of brand knowledge (e.g., brand awareness) and, their influence on the child's initial preference between fast food choices (brand preference), and their loyalty when tempted by a toy and their second choice (brand equity). The study's analysis was divided into two parts. The first part determined whether there were any significant differences evident between three and four year old children in relation to the effect of brand awareness, affect toward, and brand image in brand preference and brand equity using chi-square analyses. The second part of the analysis employed binary logistic regression analyses to determine which elements of brand knowledge influenced a child's brand preference and brand equity regarding fast foods. 2 The study found there were no major differences between a three year old and a four year old in relation to the influences of brand awareness, affect toward, and brand image in brand preference or brand equity. The binary logistic regression analysis found that brand images provided the greatest effect in explaining and predicting brand preference and provided a contributing influence in brand equity. Brand awareness was found to provide the second greatest effect on brand preference and the greatest effect on brand equity, and affect towards the brand or main menu item provided the least amount of effect in explaining and predicting brand preference and brand equity for 3 and 4 year old children. The research also comments on the use of a toy as a marketing tool to lure children to a brand and provides suggestions for future research.

While calculation of the fatal component of this measure, Years of Life Lost, is relatively straight-forward, the non-fatal component, Years Lived with Disability, is based on parameters that are challenging to estimate. This thesis pioneers the use of the Western Australian Data Linkage System to enhance epidemiological parameters underpinning Years Lived with Disability, providing, by way of illustration, a robust quantitative profile of burden of stroke in the state of Western Australia at the turn of the 21st century. The principal methodological objective was to utilise data linkage analytic methods for the specific requirements of burden of disease estimation. The principal stroke-related objectives were: 1. To estimate the parameters underpinning the non-fatal burden of stroke (Years Lived with Disability) in Western Australia in 2000. 2. To estimate the total burden of stroke (Disability-Adjusted Life Years) in Western Australia in 2000. 3. To investigate differentials in stroke burden between different sub-populations in Western Australia. 4. To calculate projections of stroke burden for Western Australia in 2016. Years Lived with Disability from stroke were calculated for Western Australia from nonfatal stroke incidence, expected duration and disability (severity) weights. Non-fatal incidence was estimated using linked hospital and death records of first-ever hospitalised stroke 28-day survivors in 2000. This was then adjusted for out-of-hospital cases determined from the population-based Perth Community Stroke Study. iv Analysis of mortality in hospitalised 28-day survivors using linked data revealed that the excess mortality in prevalent, rather than incident cases was the main disease-specific parameter required for modelling stroke duration using DisMod II specialised software. ... Access to data linkage and population-based stroke studies in Western Australia allowed more accurate estimation of non-fatal stroke burden, with previous reports most likely underestimating disability as a contributor to total burden. Although predominantly affecting the growing aged population, stroke also affects a sizable number under the age of 65 years, the age group where differentials in stroke burden are the greatest. The findings highlight the continued need for primary prevention efforts for all ages, targeting especially younger people in disadvantaged groups. The shift to greater disability burden in the future and the needs of disadvantaged groups must be considered when planning stroke services. The multiple studies undertaken for this thesis contribute to ongoing improvement of data quality and methodological refinements underpinning estimates of Years Lived with Disability, specifically for stroke, but applicable also to other diseases. Similar linked data approaches can be used in other Australian states in the future once infrastructure is developed, thereby improving estimates of disease burden for health policy and planning in the future.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cerebrovascular disease -- Epidemiology</field><field name="subject">Diseases -- Economic aspects -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Health status indicators -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Western Australia -- Statistics, Medical</field><field name="subject">Stroke</field><field name="subject">Burden of disease</field><field name="subject">Disability-adjusted life year</field><field name="subject">Epidermiology</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2009.0117</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An ecophysiological approach to determine problems associated with mine-site rehabilitation : a case study in the Great Sandy Desert, north-western Australia</field><field name="creator">Grigg, Alasdair M</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Establishment of vegetation and ecosystem functioning is central to the mitigation of environmental impacts associated with mining operations. This study investigated the ecophysiological functioning of mature plants in natural vegetation and applied this knowledge to diagnose problems affecting plant health and causes of poor plant cover at a mine-rehabilitation site. Ecophysiological parameters, including plant water relations and mineral nutrition, were studied in conjunction with soil physical, hydraulic and chemical properties. The natural ecosystem at the study location in the Great Sandy Desert is characterised by sand dunes and interdunes with distinct plant communities on each. One of the most notable features of the vegetation is the presence of large Corymbia chippendalei trees high on the dunes and relatively small scattered shrubs in the interdunes. Triodia grasses (spinifex), dominate the vegetation in both habitats but different species occur in each; T. schinzii is restricted entirely to the dunes, and T. basedowii occurs only in the interdunes. It was hypothesised that the deep sandy dunes afford greater water availability but lower nutrient supply to plants in this habitat compared with those occurring in the lower landscape position of the interdunes. Water-relations parameters (leaf water potentials, stomatal conductance, d13C) revealed that dune plants, particularly woody species, displayed higher water status and water use than closely related and often congeneric plants in the interdunes. Nutrient concentrations in soils were significantly higher in the interdunes, but concentrations in foliage were similar for related species between habitats. It is concluded that the dunes provide a greater store of accessible water than the soil profile in the interdunes. ... Following an experimental wetting pulse equivalent to a summer cyclone event, A. ancistrocarpa plants displayed significant increases in stomatal conductance, leaf water potential and sap velocity in lateral roots within three days of irrigation at the natural site and two days at the rehabilitation site. Secondary sinker roots originating from distal sections of lateral roots were evidently supplying water to maintain hydraulic function in laterals, thus enabling a fast pulse response. This was accentuated at the rehabilitation site where roots were confined closer to the surface. These results indicate that plants at the rehabilitation site are more dependent on small pulses of water and have less access to deep reserves than plants at the natural site. It is concluded that high runoff losses and insufficient soil depth are major factors contributing to plant water stress, and combined with the direct impacts of erosion, are largely responsible for plant death and ultimately poor plant cover. These issues can be alleviated if cover soil depth is increased to more than 0.5 m and slope angles are reduced to &lt;12o. This study demonstrates the value of an ecophysiological approach for diagnosing problems affecting plant establishment at mine-rehabilitation sites. Furthermore, it has provided recommendations that will improve the rehabilitation strategy and lead to the development of a well vegetated, resilient ecosystem on a stable and non-polluting land form.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mines and mining -- Environmental aspects -- Western Australia -- Great Sandy Desert</field><field name="subject">Plant ecophysiology -- Western Australia -- Great Sandy Desert</field><field name="subject">Plants, Effect of soil moisture on -- Western Australia -- Great Sandy Desert</field><field name="subject">Plants, Water requirements -- Western Australia -- Great Sandy Desert</field><field name="subject">Reclamation of land -- Western Australia -- Great Sandy Desert</field><field name="subject">Restoration ecology -- Western zAustralia -- Great Sandy Desert</field><field name="subject">Great Sandy Desert (W.A.)</field><field name="subject">Desert</field><field name="subject">Mine-site rehabilitation</field><field name="subject">Ecophysiology</field><field name="subject">Water relations</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2009.0118</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Comparison of Middle Eastern Bedouin genotypes with previously studies populations using polymorphic Alu insertions</field><field name="creator">Pitt, Alison Patricia</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Polymorphic Alu insertions (POALINs) are known to contribute to the variation and genetic diversity of the human genome. In this report specific POALINs of the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) were studied. Previous population studies on the MHC POALINs have focused on individuals of African, European and Asian descent. In this study, we expand the research by studying a new and previously uncharacterised population, focusing on the Bedouin from the Middle East. Specifically we report on the individual insertion frequencies of four POALINs within the MHC class I region of this population. POALINs are members of a young Alu subfamily that have only recently been inserted into the human genome. POALINs are either present or absent at particular sites. Individuals that share the inserted (or deleted) polymorphism inherited the insertion (or deletion) from a common ancestor, making Alu alleles identical by decent. In population genetics a comparison of the resulting products from each population can then be done by comparing the lengths of the PCR products in a series of unrelated individuals and may also detect polymorphisms with regard to the presence or absence of the Alu repeats. As a direct result of their abundance and sequence identity, they promote genetic recombination events that are responsible for large-scale deletions, duplication and translocations. The deletions occur mostly in the A-T rich regions and have found to be unlikely to have been created independently of the insertions of the Alu elements (Callinan et al, 2005) The easy genotyping of the POALINs has proven to be very valuable as lineage markers for the study of human population genetics, pedigree and forensics as well as genomic diversity and evolution. POALINs have been used in a range of applications, primarily focusing on anthropological analysis of human populations. As a result of its ease of use and its utility as a marker in human evolutions studies, combining the POALINs along with other markers used in forensics could lead to improved identity testing in forensic science. More specifically, in combination with more traditional markers, race specific genotypes and haplotypes could be used for profiling crime scene samples.  ... This is supported by previously reported molecular data using various types of genetic markers. In a study using six separate Alu genes, Antunez-de-Mayolo et al were able to generate a phylogenetic tree, in which the biogeographical groups followed a pattern. The biogeographical groups started with African populations that were found to relate closely to the hypothetical ancestral African population.

Promoted as Western Australia's Salinity Investment Framework (or the SIF), it offered a set of principles for prioritising investment decisions that were generally grounded in economic theory. This represented a significant landmark in terms of the government's appreciation of the scale of salinity problem and its acknowledgement that a full turnaround in the situation was beyond the reach of both volunteers and the public purse. The evolution of the SIF policy, including an initial trial in the Avon Basin, provided an opportunity to evaluate pre-policy processes; observe policy on the run; and test stakeholder reactions to the investment principles embodied in the the SIF, as well as their reaction to its implied outcomes. The intention of the study was to highlight any barriers standing in the way of effectively implementing a policy to prioritise investments in salinity management and identify any novel approaches developed in an attempt to overcome them. The evaluation was multifaceted to incorporate retrospective and prospective modes of inquiry. The retrospective investigation involved the construction of a series of policy narratives using evidence from notes and minutes taken at SIF meetings, as well as other formal and informal documents. It systematically captured the influence of key people, events and decisions on the SIF up until June 2008. This evaluation highlighted the impact of (1) policy entrepreneurs; (2) time lags; (3) vertical silos, and (4) priority setting hierarchies. The prospective investigation involved the execution of a community survey featuring attitudinal questions, paired comparisons and a choice modelling experiment. The survey involved 269 personal interviews with rural landholders, townspeople and landcare officers across the Avon Catchment. It captured perceptions towards past funding strategies and proposals for future allocations and explored the nature of priority setting decisions in relation to trade-offs between: (1) the mix of assets protected; (2) the degree of risk; (3) the level of community involvement in the decision, and (4) the distribution of benefits. This evaluation highlighted the importance of (1) incentives and disincentives for change; (2) awareness of priority setting concepts; (3) the capacity of regional bodies; and (4) elements perceived to be crucial in priority setting.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Salinity -- Government policy -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Salinity -- Management -- Economic aspects -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Soils, Salts in -- Management -- Economic aspects -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Salinity</field><field name="subject">Policy</field><field name="subject">Priority setting</field><field name="subject">Choice modelling</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2009.0120</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Molecular characterization of insulin-regulated aminopeptidase (IRAP)</field><field name="creator">Ye, Siying</field><field name="description">Central infusion of the hexapeptide angiotensin IV (Ang IV) and its analogs have been demonstrated to markedly enhance memory retention and retrieval in rats using a range of learning and memory paradigms. This effect is mediated by the binding of the peptide to the specific binding site previously described as the AT4 receptor. The AT4 receptor has been isolated and identified as insulin-regulated aminopeptidase (IRAP), a type II transmembrane protein belonging to the M1 family of zinc-dependent aminopeptidases. Subsequently, AT4 receptor ligands, including Ang IV and its analogues and the unrelated peptide LVV-hemorphin-7, were demonstrated to be peptide inhibitors of IRAP. These findings suggest that AT4 ligands may exert their cognitive effects by inhibiting the catalytic activity of IRAP in the brain. Therefore, IRAP is an important target for the development of a new class of therapeutic agents for the treatment of memory loss.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">IRAP, insulin-regulated aminopeptidase, AT4, Ang IV, memory and learning, virtual screening, structure-based drug design, molecular modelling</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.infodiv.unimelb.edu.au/00001651/01/Thesis_Full_Version_Revision_15_April_2006.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/53</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A conceptual framework for  situated task analysis  within the context of  Computer-Assisted Language Learning  system design</field><field name="creator">Farmer, Rod</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the role of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) task  analysis within the context of Computer-Assisted Language Learning (CALL)  system design.

Clinical and experimental evidence suggest that NMDA-type glutamate receptors are implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia.

I focus on the way the socioeconomic position of patients is a factor in that experience as my underlying interest is in exploring how health inequalities are understood, approached and handled in general practice. The study is thus a practical and grounded exploration of a widely debated theoretical issue in the study of social life, namely the relationship between the micro day-to-day interactions and events in the lives of individuals and the broad macro structure of society and the position of the individual within that.  There is now wide acceptance and evidence that people&#8217;s social and economic circumstances impact on their health status and their experiences in the health system. However, there is considerable debate about the role played by primary medical care. Nevertheless, better theoretical understanding of the importance of psychosocial processes in generating social inequalities in health suggests medical care may well be important, as such processes are crucial in the care of chronic illnesses such as diabetes which are now such a large part of general practice work.  I approach this study through an exploration of patient centred clinical practice. Patient centredness is a pragmatic, idealised prescriptive framework for clinical practice, particularly general practice. Patient centredness developed in part in response to critiques of biomedicine, and is premised on a notion of a more equal relationship between GP and patient, and one that places importance on the context of patients&#8217; lives.

Antonio</field><field name="description">In this thesis two different problems in distributed sensor networks are considered. Part I involves optimal quantiser design for decentralised estimation of a two-state hidden Markov model with dual sensors. The notion of optimality for quantiser design is based on minimising the probability of error in estimating the hidden Markov state. Equations for the filter error are derived for the continuous (unquantised) sensor outputs (signals), which are used to benchmark the performance of the quantisers. Minimising the probability of filter error to obtain the quantiser breakpoints is a difficult problem therefore an alternative method is employed. The quantiser breakpoints are obtained by maximising the mutual information between the quantised signals and the hidden Markov state. This method is known to work well for the single sensor case. Cases with independent and correlated noise across the signals are considered. The method is then applied to Markov processes with Gaussian signal noise, and further investigated through simulation studies. Simulations involving both independent and correlated noise across the sensors are performed and a number of interesting new theoretical results are obtained, particularly in the case of correlated noise.  In Part II, the focus shifts to the detection of faults in helicopter transmission systems. The aim of the investigation is to determine whether the acoustic signature can be used for fault detection and diagnosis. To investigate this, statistical change detection algorithms are applied to acoustic vibration data obtained from the main rotor gearbox of a Bell 206 helicopter, which is run at high load under test conditions.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">hidden Markov model, machine fault detection, machine fault diagnosis, non-linear filtering, mutual information, auto-regressive moving average, ARMA, generalised likelihood ratio, GLR</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.infodiv.unimelb.edu.au/00000943/01/ThesisFinal.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/78</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A morphology of pattern for kinetic facades</field><field name="creator">Moloney, Jules</field><field name="description">This research examines the zone between environment and interior, the architectural fa&#231;ade, for the potential to develop a new form of composition based on kinetic pattern.

The principal aims of this thesis were to evaluate the cognitive, behavioural, and neuroanatomical profile of WS individuals and to explore the relationships between aspects of the cognitive and behavioural profile and the neuroanatomical changes that are evident in WS. Three general hypotheses, and 10 specific hypotheses, were postulated as a means of exploring these aims.  The first general hypothesis predicted that WS individuals would demonstrate distinct features within their cognitive and behavioural profile.  Specifically, it was predicted that WS individuals would show relative strengths on verbal tasks and significant deficits on visuospatial and mathematical tasks, in contrast to control participants who were predicted to show a more even profile.

It is clear that the Electronic Attack (EA), or jamming, of such radar systems is expected to become a more difficult task. The reason for this research was to address the issue of jamming adaptive radar systems. This required consideration of adaptive jamming systems and the development of a methodology for outlining the features of such a system is proposed as the key contribution of this thesis. For the first time, game-based optimization methods have been applied to a maritime counter-surveillance/counter-targeting scenario involving conventional, as well as so-called &#8216;smart&#8217; noise jamming.Conventional noise jamming methods feature prominently in the origins of radar electronic warfare, and are still widely implemented. They have been well studied, and are important for comparisons with coherent jamming techniques.Moreover, noise jamming is more readily applied with limited information support and is therefore germane to the problem of jamming adaptive radars; during theearly stages when the jammer tries to learn about the radar&#8217;s parameters and its own optimal actions.A radar and a jammer were considered as informed opponents &#8216;playing&#8217; in a non-cooperative two-player, zero-sum game. The effects of jamming on the target detection performance of a radar using Constant False Alarm Rate (CFAR)processing were analyzed using a game theoretic approach for three cases: (1) Ungated Range Noise (URN), (2) Range-Gated Noise (RGN) and (3) False-Target (FT) jamming.Assuming a Swerling type II target in the presence of Rayleigh-distributed clutter, utility functions were described for Cell-Averaging (CA) and Order Statistic (OS) CFAR processors and the three cases of jamming. The analyses included optimizations of these utility functions, subject to certain constraints, with respectto control variables (strategies) in the jammer, such as jammer power and spatial extent of jamming, and control variables in the radar, such as threshold parameter and reference window size. The utility functions were evaluated over the players&#8217; strategy sets and the resulting matrix-form games were solved for the optimal or &#8216;best response&#8217; strategies of both the jammer and the radar.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">non-cooperative games, zero sum games, Nash equilibrium, saddle points, minimax, target detection, Rayleigh clutter, constant false alarm rate, incoherent noise jamming, CFAR, Cell Averaging CFAR, Order Statistic CFAR, ungated range noise, range gated noise, false target jamming</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.infodiv.unimelb.edu.au/00002983/01/Thesis.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/293</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The antecedents of appropriate audit support system use</field><field name="creator">Dowling, Carlin</field><field name="description">This study investigates the factors that influence appropriate use of audit support systems.  Appropriate use is use of an audit support system in a manner consistent with how the audit firm expects the system to be used.  Investigating appropriate use of audit support systems is important because the extent to which these systems can assist auditors achieve efficient and high quality audits depends on how auditors use them.  Adaptive Structuration Theory (AST) (DeSanctis and Poole, 1994) and the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) (Ajzen, 1991) are combined to model the relationship between constructs hypothesised to increase the probability that audit support systems are used appropriately.  The theoretical model decomposes two TPB antecedents, perceived normative pressure (or subjective norms) and perceived behavioural control, into the exogenous constructs hypothesised to influence whether audit support systems are used appropriately.  Perceived normative pressure is decomposed into two socio-ideological control mechanisms, team and firm consensus on appropriation.  Perceived behavioural control is decomposed into self-efficacy and two technocratic control mechanisms, perceived system restrictiveness and perceived audit review effectiveness.

Using dance as window through which to analyse Australian culture, this thesis explores notions of the dancing &#8216;body&#8217; in Australia. For this research, the term dancing &#8216;body&#8217; is used to indicate a kind of artistic identity that incorporates various elements of the mind, the physical being, the conscious and unconscious idea of &#8216;self,&#8217; and the external perceptions and stereotypes about dancers. Importantly, perceptions and understandings about the dancing &#8216;body&#8217; were not static during the Interwar period. They changed physically, emotionally, environmentally, socially, politically, and dynamically, depending on the genre of dance being analysed. This thesis identifies four main types of dance that became popular in Australia during the Interwar period&#8212;ballroom, physical culture, modern dance and classical ballet &#8212;recognising that each type presented a slightly different dancing &#8216;body&#8217; to the world and was perceived accordingly. These types were differentiated by their dynamic, environment, relationships between dancers, level of professionalism, accompanying music, and societal or political purpose, yet all share an emphasis on the corporeal form, an element of performance or spectacle, and an association with femininity.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">dance, Australian culture, modernity, identity, ballroom, modern dance, ballet, physical culture</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/4887</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/4887</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mande popular music and cultural policies in West Africa</field><field name="creator">Counsel, G.</field><field name="description">During the independence era in West Africa (1958&#8211;1980) many nations embarked on ambitious programmes aimed at rejuvenating their traditional art forms. These programmes were realised through new cultural policies, with music the prime target of the governments&#8217; campaigns. I contend that in the search for an appropriate voice West African governments focussed on one group of musicians, the Mande griots. It was through their musical compositions that the State communicated ideology and doctrine to the public. I assert that to focus on a specific ethnic group and promote them as cultural ambassadors was a policy that conflicted with the core principles of West Africa&#8217;s governments, who upheld a doctrine that promoted nationalism over ethnocentrism. It was a neo-colonialist strategy designed to consolidate the rule of the governing party, a contention which I support through an analysis of the role of griots in West African society and an appraisal of the careers of musicians, musical recordings, and musical styles. This thesis represents a historical account of Mande griots in West Africa with respect to their influence on local and national politics.

The main immunological barrier to xenografting from pig-to-primate is the antigen, Galactose-&#945;1,3-Galactose (Gal) which is found in all species except humans and other higher primates.  Even with the major advancement of deleting Gal from the potential pig donor species with the aid of cloning technology, complete elimination may be elusive as alternative genes yet to be fully characterised, may still produce Gal at low levels.  Thus, the human immune response against Gal may continue to be a barrier to successful xenotransplantation. The aim of this project was to develop small animal models of the important components of xenograft rejection that largely relate to the anti-Gal immune response.  These include models of hyperacute, acute vascular and chronic xenograft-like rejection that in turn, provide new insights in the immune mechanisms of the rejection processes.  The role of antibody and both innate and cognate cellular immunity are explored.  Both vascularised heart grafts and non-vascularised skin graft models are examined as rejection of solid organs may differ from cellular transplantation.

Efficient scheduling is a vital tool in successful decision-making. To date, an enormous amount of research has been done on scheduling problems arising from various disciplines. Major attention has so far been dedicated to off-line (usually deterministic) scheduling problems. Off-line deterministic scheduling deals with perfect information. That is, all information with regard to a problem is known prior to any decision. However, this perfect information assumption violates the nature of many realistic issues with uncertainties, for example, a situation where the knowledge of problem instances is revealed over time, or a scenario in which processing tasks are temporarily disrupted or cancelled. To better formulate this sort of problem with high uncertainties, a new concept of on-line scheduling was introduced. On-line approaches have become increasingly important and are frequently encountered when only partial knowledge is available but instant or very fast solution methods are required and should nevertheless result in good outcomes. In on-line scheduling, a decision maker allocates resources between tasks as the information is gradually released. Obviously, given the same scheduling environment and problem instance, the result produced by an on-line scheduler cannot be better than that by the optimal off-line scheduler; but the on-line scheduling technique immunizes schedules from future disruptions and uncertainties.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">on-line scheduling, on-line algorithms, scheduling problems</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/3538</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/3538</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Topics in resource allocation in wireless sensor networks</field><field name="creator">Li, Chaofeng (James)</field><field name="description">The focus of this thesis is on the resource allocation problems in wireless sensor and cooperative networks.

Keys to future generations of mobile communication are multimedia communications capability, wireless access to broadband fixed and mobile networks, and seamless roaming among different systems. Increasing demand for currently used bands at lower frequency spectrum has reduced the ability to allocate the large spectrum bandwidths required for broadband radio applications. Current trend in cellular networks, both in mobile and fixed, are to reduce cell size to accommodate more users and to operate in the microwave and millimetre wave frequency bands to avoid spectral congestion. Moreover, larger radio frequency (RF) propagation losses at mm-wave bands reduce the cell size covered by a single base station (BS) and allow an increased frequency reuse factor to improve spectrum utilization efficiency. These factors demand cellular networks to have a larger number of simple, compact and low-cost BSs connecting to a central office to cover a service area. Furthermore, analog optical link nonlinearity, line-of sight constraint, spectral inefficiency, inefficient remote node (RN) architectures and inefficiency in RF power conversion have become major obstacles in achieving high performance fibre-radio systems for the provision of wireless services.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/3426</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/3426</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Late Neogene stratigraphy and sedimentation across the Murray Basin, southeastern Australia</field><field name="creator">Miranda, J.

Social democratic politics is thus in a state of critical self-reflection.  More precisely, in Australia, pragmatic social democracy has faced profound challenges with the emergence both of neo-liberal models of society and policy, and with the development of third way social democracy which seeks to combine the social justice concerns of pragmatic social democracy with the market based economics of neo-liberalism. To explore the dynamic contests between these different approaches, this thesis provides a critical exploration of the actual and potential contributions that policies modeled on pragmatic and third way social democracy, and on neo-liberalism, make to the lives of people with disabilities.

First and foremost the crisis saw the collapse of the main political parties, the Christian Democracy and the Socialist Party. In a different manner and only one year prior to this crisis, the former Communist Party, also underwent major changes and evolved into a social democratic party, the Democratic Party of the Left.  Though this crisis was sparked by a corruption revelation, it became a catalyst for a change in the deformities of a political system, of the partitocracy, which was itself the product of Cold War conditions faced by Italy in the post-war period. The focus of this study has been to re-evaluate the causes of this crisis with particular attention to the role of the Cold War as the over-arching influence which directly and indirectly influenced many of the internal dynamics of the Italian political process. The hypothesis of this research was that the end of the Cold War in 1991 as a factor which provoked this political crisis, was far more important as a cause than has hitherto been acknowledged. The study examines the other indicated possible causes including the impact of the corruption revelations, the role of the magistrates in uncovering corruption, the economic crisis, the role of the new protest movement of the Lega Nord and finally the especially brutal equilibrium with Italian political forces re-established by the Mafia after 1992.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Italian politics, corruption, Cold War, partitocracy, Italian political parties</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.infodiv.unimelb.edu.au/00001490/01/Dissertation_complete.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/69</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Designing for better pedagogy:  a case study of professional development of teachers of adults in Pakistan</field><field name="creator">Chaudary, Imran Anjum</field><field name="description">This qualitative, ethnographic case study explores the professional development opportunities for teachers of adults in Pakistan in order to understand how these are currently experienced and what changes can be made to make them more effective.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">professional development, design, adult education, tertiary education, case study, ethnography, Pakistan</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/4885</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/4885</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Text and context of malediction: a study of antisemitic and heterosexist hate violence in New South Wales 1995-2000</field><field name="creator">Asquith, Nicole</field><field name="description">This dissertation investigates the broad area of social hate discourse.

Using the case study of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY), the thesis evaluates whether international criminal justice can contribute positively to victim vindication and restoration. While the historical war crimes tribunals at Nuremberg and Tokyo have been widely criticised for exercising a &#8220;victor&#8217;s justice&#8221;, this thesis illustrates a discernible shift towards a form of &#8220;victim&#8217;s justice&#8221; that extends beyond the parameters of punishment and proportionality for serious violations of international humanitarian law (IHL). Restorative principles of justice have thus been increasingly incorporated within current international criminal jurisdictions, reflected in victim-friendly legislation at the ICTY and the recently established International Criminal Court (ICC). These developments recognise the significance of justice for victims in the aftermath of armed conflict.

One important reason for monitoring high rise buildings (and other engineering structures) is their safety assessment in events of extreme loading, such as earthquakes and storms. Decisions must be made as soon as possible, whether to allow re-occupation of such buildings, or to assess them for further damage. The time required to reach such decisions is cost-critical, both for the building owner or manager and for the agency doing the assessment. Peak inter-storey drift ratio and detection of permanent damage are some of the damage assessment parameters recommended by assessment agencies. Traditionally, accelerometers have been used to monitor these parameters. Accelerometers measure accelerations which are double-integrated to get displacements. These double integrated displacements are then used for computing the inter-storey drift ratios and locating permanent damage. Displacements obtained by double-integration and inter-storey drift ratios by subtraction of these displacements, are often erroneous and unreliable and direct measurement of displacement is preferred. Direct measurement of displacement is required at a number of points along the height of the building. For example, for computing inter-storey drift ratios, measurements of displacement at both the floor level and roof level are required. Such points on buildings and other engineering structures of vertical profile are termed as mid-height points in this thesis. While GPS has been used for deformation monitoring of engineering structures and to assist in damage assessment during and after extreme loading events, its use has been limited to roof top installations.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">GPS, structural deformation monitoring, engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/3340</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/3340</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Language maintenance shift of a three generation Italian family in three migration countries : an international comparative study</field><field name="creator">Finocchiaro, Dr Carla M.</field><field name="description">This thesis is a comparative investigation into the use of Italian of an extended Italian family in language contact situation in three countries: the United States, Australia and France.

In particular, this work focuses on regional integration in Eastern and Southern Africa.  The aim of the thesis is to assess the effectiveness of the relevant legal regimes and determine ways in which they can be made more effective, both in terms of their impact on state conduct and in terms of their impact on the economic welfare of the states concerned. The thesis argues that, with regard to the WTO legal regime, the exemption from the application of Article XXIV, GATT 1994 given to developing countries by the Enabling Clause has contributed to the lack of effectiveness of the WTO regime.  For developing countries, on the other hand, the Enabling Clause has deprived them of the legal discipline required to establish effective free trade areas and customs unions.  This latter argument is examined through a case study of the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA).  The thesis contends that for COMESA countries to engage in meaningful trade liberalisation, and to participate fully in the WTO, acceptance of greater legal discipline is critical.  Such legal discipline can be obtained through compliance with Article XXIV.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">international trade law, regional trade agreements, Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa, regional integration</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.infodiv.unimelb.edu.au/00001628/01/wholeMutai_.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/529</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Transportable literacies and transformative pedagogies: an investigation of the tensions and choices in the provision of education for bilingualism and biliteracy</field><field name="creator">Molyneux, Paul David</field><field name="description">English and a Mandarin-English bilingual program for its students in the first two to three years of their school education.

Many of those concerns were products of the nationalistic endeavours arising from political upheavals and redefinitions in nineteenth-century Europe, the imperialism which reached its zenith by the First World War, and the racialist beliefs, hierarchies and anxieties accompanying that imperialism. In particular, Grainger&#8217;s lifelong concern with racial identity manifested in hierarchical and evolutionary museum interpretations typical of his earlier years.

Kuuk Thaayorre possesses features of typological interest at each of these levels.  At the phonological level, Kuuk Thaayorre possesses a particularly rich vowel inventory from an Australian perspective, with five distinct vowel qualities and two contrastive lengths producing ten vowel phonemes.  It is in the phonotactic combination of sounds that Kuuk Thaayorre phonology is particularly noteworthy, however.  Kuuk Thaayorre&#8217;s tendency towards closed syllables (with codas containing up to three consonants) frequently leads to consonant clusters of as many as four segments.  Kuuk Thaayorre is also cross-linguistically unusual in allowing sequences of its two rhotics (an alveolar tap/trill and retroflex continuant) within the syllable &#8211; either as a complex coda or as onset plus syllabic rhotic.

The loads, concentrations and forms of P in surface and subsurface hydrological flow pathways were estimated or measured directly on high and low P fertility hill slope plots in south-west Victoria to assess how this practice change could affect the P status of runoff and drainage water. Small plot rainfall simulator studies were also conducted to investigate pasture management treatment effects. The spatial and temporal distribution of P loss from hillslope pastures, and the processes of P mobilisation in runoff identified in this study were used to identify appropriate management practises to help minimise P losses in runoff. Runoff P concentrations were then related to properties of pasture soils and runoff at a range of locations across Victoria to identify whether simple models and/or soil P tests could be used to predict P concentrations in runoff.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">runoff, drainage, grazing systems, fertiliser, nitrogen</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.infodiv.unimelb.edu.au/00002204/01/ARMellandPhD.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/735</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">From affliction to empathy: melodrama and mental illness in recent films from Australia and New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Hopgood, Fincina Elizabeth</field><field name="description">The subject matter of mental illness has fascinated artists and writers for centuries. Filmmakers have responded in diverse and innovative ways to the artistic challenge of portraying mental illness. In this thesis, I focus on the representations of mental illness in six recent films from Australia and New Zealand: Sweetie (Jane Campion, 1989), An Angel at My Table (Campion, 1990), Bad Boy Bubby (Rolf de Heer, 1993), Heavenly Creatures (Peter Jackson, 1994), Angel Baby (Michael Rymer, 1995) and Shine (Scott Hicks, 1996). In each film, the protagonist is diagnosed, or treated by others, as mentally ill. Mental illness is portrayed as an affliction which the protagonist struggles to overcome. I argue that these films cultivate a relationship of empathy between the mentally ill character and the spectator. Whereas the related emotion of sympathy involves feeling sorry for someone, empathy involves feeling with that person; in other words, rather than feel for these mentally ill characters, we are invited to feel like they do.

Since the 1890s progressive development of the irrigation infrastructure of the Tragowel Plains has been accompanied by the development of irrigation induced soil salinity. In 1988 the State Government of Victoria supported the development of a community managed salinity management plan. At the same time, the water supply industry was significantly deregulated. Full cost recovery principles were applied to irrigation water pricing. Water entitlements were transformed into tradable commodities.The Tragowel Plains Salinity Plan was subsequently promoted by the Victorian government and the Loddon irrigation community as a model for encouraging structural change in a Commonwealth government facilitated regional development plan for the whole of the Loddon-Murray irrigation region. The process of developing this regional development plan revealed  difference in the objectives of the various actors in this new planning process. The objective of community planners was the survival of the irrigation district. One of the objectives of Commonwealth was the transfer of water from low value use to high value use. These higher value uses were potentially elsewhere in the Murray Darling Basin. Further, these actors in the planning process used differing implicit models of the process of structural change in irrigation areas. The Commonwealth representatives had an implicit model of structural change in which farm consolidation was driven by the rate of exit from farming. They were also sceptical of the capacity of the Tragowel Plains salinity plan model to facilitate significant change in water use.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">salinity, salinity control, water reform, Tragowel Plains Irrigation District, Loddon catchment, Victoria, Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.infodiv.unimelb.edu.au/00000230/01/Barr.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/835</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Travel time budgets in an urban area</field><field name="creator">Hodges,  Fiona</field><field name="description">It is important to the future of Melbourne that its development should take the direction of the most benefit to those who live in the city and those who may live here in the future.

Policymakers are seeking positive economic models however policies are not based upon an explicit detailed understanding of the nature of the industry nor an explicit model of firm and industry performance. The positive economic model accepts that the industry is specialised and heterogenous with varied structural and behavioural characteristics across individual markets.

Temperate grassy woodlands have been extensively modified since European settlement of Victoria and consequently the native biodiversity associated with them has undergone a dramatic decline.  Paramount to this decline has been the landscape-scale reduction in tree cover associated with agricultural clearing, which in some regions approaches 95% or pre-European extent.

This study presents close analysis of selected incidents that occurred mainly in Java in the years prior to this and in its aftermath. It tests explanations of anti-Chinese violence based on economic resentment, religious difference or state-sponsorship. By highlighting ethnicity as the single constant, as well as the importance of locating agency and responsibility, and the sources of representations of events of mass violence, the study challenges existing understandings of &#8220;anti-Chinese&#8221; violence. The approach taken recognises that violence against ethnic Chinese Indonesians must be viewed within the context of Indonesian nationalism and alongside other violence in Indonesia. It cannot be separated from the national political, social and economic turmoil of that time. In addition, it emphasises the competing representations of &#8220;Chineseness&#8221; and anti-Chinese violence for what they reveal about the motives behind certain explanations of violence and the events themselves. Of central significance is the way in which anti-Chinese violence is represented and perceived in Indonesian society as normal, natural and everyday. This study stresses the importance of listening to the voices of victims of violence and seeks to recognise the moral concerns related to scholarly and &#8220;official&#8221; generalisations about violence and suffering in particular.

The southern emu-wren is threatened in several parts of its range, and yet information on the species&#8217; breeding biology, habitat use and mating system is lacking. These data are fundamental to effective conservation management. My research investigated the breeding behaviour and habitat ecology of a population of southern emu-wrens in Portland, Victoria, Australia, over three breeding seasons (2000/01, 2001/02 and 2002/03). also collected data pertaining to habitat use from populations located in Anglesea and Lower Glenelg National Park (Victoria, Australia). Southern emu-wrens commonly formed socially monogamous pair bonds, although cooperative breeding was observed for the first time in this species, where male offspring within several families delayed breeding to help raise younger siblings. Successful nests produced 1.8 fledglings on average, however, a nest had only a 56% chance of success during incubation and nestling phases. Nest failure was mainly attributed to depredation and snakes were identified as major nest predators. The slow breeding rate of the southern emu-wren is typical of a small passerine in the Southern Hemisphere. Nevertheless, adult mortality was unusually high. In one breeding season the adult population was reduced by 50%. The population recovered when individuals dispersed from the adjacent coastal heathland to fill territory vacancies. This highlights the vulnerability of populations to local catastrophe, and potential extinction if spatial separation of populations exceeds the species&#8217; dispersal capacity.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">southern emu-wren, ornithology, bird conservation, Maluridae, habitat use, territory quality, parental care</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.infodiv.unimelb.edu.au/00001481/01/Thesis_grainne_maguire_final.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/1057</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The genetic control of neural crest development in early craniofacial morphogenesis</field><field name="creator">McKeown, Sonja Jane</field><field name="description">Craniofacial development requires orchestrated and complex interactions between multiple tissues of different origins.

The timing and mechanism by which cranial neural crest cells progressively differentiate from multipotent stem cells into lineage restricted and terminally differentiating cell types has previously not been investigated. In addition, there are many deficits in our knowledge of the molecular controls regulating early development of neural crest cells within the branchial arches. Spatial and temporal changes in migratory and lineage potential in neural crest populations contributing to the developing first branchial arch and trigeminal ganglia were examined by back-transplanting cells from quail into chick embryos.  Neural crest cells that had barely entered the first branchial arch had largely lost both the ability to localise to the trigeminal ganglia and neurogenic differentiation capacity but were still capable of long-distance migration.

The 1970s were thus a time of fluidity and experimentation, as right-to-lifers contemplated different approaches and argued over how best to end legalized abortion. Activists engaged in legislative efforts, political lobbying, and education initiatives, all the while teasing out what exactly it meant to be opposed to abortion. The movement at this time rejected the ideas of absolutists and instead aimed to be as broadly representative of American society as possible.

In examining these policies, this thesis argues that the association of environmentalism with the politics of policy-making reflected the primary role played by the Australian Labor Party as the major political party in Government at that time. It reflected the Labor Government&#8217;s primary role in determining the nature and direction of the debate between 1983 and 1996. Of particular importance was a period in which the Labor Government sought to undertake institutional innovation in order to contain the environmental debate within the institutionalised policy-making process - a period described here as the &#8216;Accordist&#8217;; phase of Labor&#8217;s management of the environmental debate.  The thesis challenges theoretical approaches that argue that relations between social democratic trade union based parties and the environmental movement have the potential to tend toward mutual antagonism. It also challenges the argument that environmentalism, as a manifestation of the &#8216;new politics&#8217;, necessarily involves a qualitative transformation of politics associated with new social movements. Rather, the thesis argues that the debate in Australia went beyond simply addressing controversial specific issues when they arose, to instead become an examination of the capacity for agencies and departments to incorporate environmental values into their decision-making, and about ways in which competing interest group demands could be reconciled through newly created government-led forums.

The professional development of teachers is often seen by teachers to be a purely private matter serving self-improvement and/or career advancement. Equally often it is assumed to be essentially collegial concerned with improved school responses to redefined social expectations. Little is known about how, at the intersection of personal interactions and social necessities, truth is constructed by teachers about the significance of professional development exercises. This ontological research investigated the influence of the community of practice in signifying professional development of teachers' professional identity formation. It is a proximal influence that has been largely neglected in the literature on professional development. The case studies conducted here of science teachers in a rural secondary school initially assumed that certain types of autonomy and collegiality, together with differing workplace conditions have a more positive influence on teachers' professional development than others. The use of teacher portfolios in professional development reporting was investigated as institutional scaffolding for facilitating the sharing of insights from often remote professional development experiences, and as a means of improving communication within the science department.Positioning theory, as a tool in discursive psychology, was used to analyse professional development experiences as narrated by four colleagues in conversations with the author.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">In-service training of teachers, In-service training of science teachers in Victoria</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.infodiv.unimelb.edu.au/00000832/01/Allan.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/1114</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Defining a marine cadastre: legal and institutional aspects</field><field name="creator">Binns, Andrew</field><field name="description">This thesis aims to define the concept of a marine cadastre through an analysis of institutional and legal aspects of Australia&#8217;s current marine based management system.

Optimization of the design parameters for sublevel caving has ensued with the objective of maximizing ore recovery while minimizing waste dilution. Past studies have been confined by two simplifying assumptions: that the region of flow be approximated by a simple mathematical function, and that the flow analysis is static, ie extraction is calculated by employing an idealized ore-waste boundary position for each ring. Further investigation into models of ore flow has been stimulated on two counts.1. full scale tests have indicated that a more complex description is required;2. as a design tool, a dynamic analysis that monitors the displacement of the broken rock mass during extraction would yield more realistic recovery predictions under operating conditions, and enable variations on the method to be evaluated.This study reviews the various formulations currently available, or being developed to describe the flow of granular material. A viable solution in a mining context would be three dimensional, time dependent, and incorporate stress conditions. Although workers in diverse fields have analyzed the problem no solution exists at present. The majority of studies are either empirical in nature, or deficient in one or other of the above criteria. Two approaches are developed and implemented on a digital computer:(i) stochastic flow model(ii) empirical flow model based on the results of modelling studies, and full scale test. Although a number of concepts introduced in these models remain to be verified, the validity of these models would be measured by their success or failure as a simulation tool in a mining environment.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">mathematical models of the design of mine shafts, mining engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.infodiv.unimelb.edu.au/00000380/01/Alford.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/1159</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies of balance in older people</field><field name="creator">Hill,  Keith David</field><field name="description">Balance dysfunction and the resultant falls and injuries, loss of confidence, alternations lifestyle and the overall costs are a major problem to older people in Australia.

Drying systems, such as kilns, control the external environment in order to manipulate moisture diffusion and transport mechanisms; however they are powerless to manipulate wood density or permeability. Controlled application of microwave energy has been shown to selectively rupture the wood structure creating radial pathways in the wood through which moisture may readily move. New analytical equations that describe simultaneous heat and moisture transport during microwave heating have been derived and validated. These new equations assume that the microwave fields decay exponentially with distance inside the irradiated material and  enforce a boundary condition, which allows convective heat transfer at the inter-facial boundary between the moist dielectric material and the air. They demonstrate the importance of applying the theory of simultaneous heat and moisture movement to microwave heating. In this theory a set of synchronised heat and moisture waves propagate through the material with velocities that are vastly different from those predicted by the constant vapour concentration thermal diffusivity of the material. They also correctly predict the &#8220;S&#8221; shaped temperature versus electric field strength curves discussed by other authors.(For complete abstract open document)</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">microwave, microwave radiation, modeling, lumber, wood, solar, drying</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.infodiv.unimelb.edu.au/00000971/01/GBThesis.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/1217</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Suspension dewatering: characterisation and optimisation</field><field name="creator">Usher, Shane Patrick</field><field name="description">The alumina industry produces a significant quantity of bauxite residue suspension (red mud) that must be washed and dewatered in trains of thickeners and residue disposal areas to recover valuable alumina and sodium hydroxide.

Facies analysis of the Bacchus Marsh Formation, based on a critical review of literature on glacial sedimentary processes and environments, identifies the following major facies groups: 1. Subglacial tillites deposited beneath wet-based ice. Some of these tillites exhibit structures indicative of a number of subglacial processes such as frictional lodgement of large clasts, subglacial bed deformation, subglacial meltwater flow and subglacial size sorting of clasts. Other subglacial tillites are essentially structureless. 2. Bedded diamictites to sandstones deposited predominantly by ice-rafting of debris into standing water. 3. Fluvial outwash sandstone and conglomorate facies that are finer-grained than typical proglacial outwash facies. 4. Deltas and subaqueous outwash fans vary from sandy sediments deposited by proglacial and subglacial streams to coarse, poorly sorted complexes deposited as debris aprons close to the ice front. Abundant underflow deposits suggest that less than normal marine salinities prevailed in these water bodies, even if they were arms of the sea. 5.

Chiang Mai is the second largest city following Bangkok (Thailand capital). Growth and development of Chiang Mai is rapid in terms of social and economic changes. Many women work outside the home as well as perform housework, and thus dual roles are common. Labour force participation for women in the childbearing years has increased rapidly, particularly in the non-agricultural sector. The demands of the formal labour market in the urban setting mean that most mothers must leave their children when they are working. These circumstances make combining reproductive and productive roles difficult, with possible implications for the breastfeeding relationship.

Wheeler was very popular with the buying public over many decades, but success with his nudes was fundamentally a critical one. The positive response to Wheeler&#8217;s nudes, paintings which combined elements of the academic tradition and more fashionable conventions, presents an intriguing reflection on the nature of art criticism in Australia. The style of Wheeler&#8217;s discourse is indebted not only to late nineteenth century British models, as it was represented in the writings of critics such as R.A.M. Stevenson, who was primarily concerned with technique, but also to current debates about art and morality. One of the determining characteristics of this discourse was an interest in defining the limits between naked and nude. Critics were particularly concerned to protect the nude as a genre against moral attack by refusing to engage in a discussion of its sensual aspects. While the public was keen to debate the moral problems associated with the nude, the critics were anxious to avoid these issues. They felt that questions of morality were not central to artistic merit, and sensed that by engaging in discussion of this kind, the nude was on danger of being brought into disrepute.</field><field name="date">1991</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Criticism and interpretation of Charles Wheeler, 1880-1977, Nude in art</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.infodiv.unimelb.edu.au/00000570/01/Pennings.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/1432</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of digital video media in second language listening comprehension</field><field name="creator">Gruba,  Paul Andrew</field><field name="description">The aim of this investigation was to examine the role of visual elements in second language listening comprehension when digital video was used as a mode of presentation.

With the aim of investigating the relationship between heteronormative schooling cultures and queer teachers, six same-sex attracted teachers were interviewed.  The interviews were analysed, using discourse analysis, in order to examine teachers&#8217; understanding of their school culture and its intersection with their sexual identity.  The analysis and discussion showed a divide between teachers who chose to be out to students and those who did not.  Most of the participants felt that their level of openness about their sexuality linked closely to their personality and that this dictated how much of their identity they wished to be on display at school.  This often had a flow-on effect to how they managed other issues, such as addressing homophobia in their school. Participants were concerned about being labeled a pedophile or being seen as trying to recruit students to homosexuality and were therefore conscious of not looking or acting too stereotypically gay.  This suggests that lesbian and gay teachers expend more energy and are more conscious of their demeanor than straight teachers in the heteronormative school cultures in which they operate.

Other studies have suggested that aging increases the frequency of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutation and leads to the accumulation of mutant mtDNA species, mainly those with large deletions and point mutations. Although the mitochondrial theory of aging may be more applicable to post mitotic tissues, abnormalities of mtDNA have also been reported in tissues which retain a mitotic capacity. Fresh tissues from elderly patients are difficult to obtain and only a limited number of studies on biochemical examination of respiratory chain enzyme complex activities have been carried out. Prostate tissue is readily available in elderly male subjects because of the high prevalence of benign prostatic hypertrophy in this sub-group of the population, and endoscopic surgery is routinely performed for excision of the diseased prostate. In this study, mitochondrial respiratory function and the mtDNA mutations in prostate tissues of elderly patients (aged from 56 to 92) were studied in 24 subjects. This included the measurement of the activities of the respiratory chain enzyme complexes and screening for mitochondrial point mutations and deletions at sites commonly affected in neurodegenerative diseases.

The present work is important and necessary because current models are unable to properly describe recent experimental results obtained using the Atomic Force Microscope (AFM) and Surface Force Apparatus (SFA).  We revisit and improve on theories involving interacting deformable droplets.  A detailed theoretical model of the experiments, which accounts for surface forces, hydrodynamic interactions, droplet deformation and AFM cantilever detection, has been developed.  The new feature of the model is the use of matched asymptotic expansions to derive a new boundary condition at constant volume to obtain results that are independent of the size of the computational domain.  The AFM experiments provide measurements of dynamical forces between two interacting droplets as well as between a drop and a colloidal particle of micrometre radii in solution when they are driven together and then are retracted from each other.  The SFA experiments measure (time dependent) surface profiles of a millimetre size mercury drop interacting with a mica surface. Different configurations have been studied including mechanical and electrical perturbations to a thin film stabilized by double layer repulsion.  Interesting experimental features were observed when approaching or retracting the mica from the mercury drop.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">mathematics, hydrodynamic interactions</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.infodiv.unimelb.edu.au/00003700/01/Manica_phdthesis[1].pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/1573</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/1573</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Migration, work and community: Italian speakers in the Walhalla gold mining district 1865-1915</field><field name="creator">Davine, Annamaria</field><field name="description">This thesis studies migration, work and community among Italian speakers in the Walhalla (situated in Victoria, Australia) gold mining district between 1865 and 1915, and analyzes the outcomes for those who either lived here for a time (as &#8216;sojourners&#8217; in conventional historical parlance) or settled permanently in the district.

The thesis offers a reconstructed history of Walhalla&#8217;s Italian community that challenges the prevailing emphasis of the district&#8217;s Anglo-centric history by using seemingly small and &#8216;insignificant&#8217; events in order to develop broader themes which test and re-define &#8216;big picture&#8217; history.

Collective case study was employed, with each case progressively informing the analysis of subsequent cases. The classrooms of teachers who were seen by their school communities to display 'good teaching practice' were selected for study. It was anticipated that such classrooms would provide more opportunity to study creative thinking than classrooms chosen at random. During the research period, each student participated individually in post-lesson interviews that were stimulated by lesson video material. To generate data to study student thinking, and the social and personal influences upon it, students were asked to identify parts of the lesson that were important to them, and discuss what was happening, and what they were thinking and feeling.

In this investigation, issues of identity, nationalism and memory have been central to an exploratory study of the contested memories of Eureka. The records of the Victorian goldfields in 1854 were examined to discover to what extent contemporaries thought they were establishing a new social order. The immediate political gains won by the Stockade had ramifications for the whole of Australia. Later interpretations of 1854 are also examined, to understand how later generations, in different times and places, interpreted the actions of the Stockaders of 1854. These interpretations are epitomized in literature, music, art, museums, public celebrations and commemorations, in Ballarat and elsewhere. Central to this thesis has been the role of the Eureka flag as a symbol of identity and a symbol of protest. The contests surrounding its creation, ownership, authenticity, and exhibition are examined. In spite of these concerns, the flag became a powerful symbol, flexible enough to be used by extreme Right and Left wing political movements. Using the Nietzschean analysis of the uses and abuses of history, the thesis examines the role of public history through the memorialisation and commemoration of an historic event, and examines the process of constructing a Eureka interpretation centre in Ballarat.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">riots in Ballarat (Victoria), history of the Eureka Stockade</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/2358</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/2358</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Improving the efficiency and capabilities of document structuring</field><field name="creator">Marshall, Robert</field><field name="description">Natural language generation (NLG), the problem of creating human-readable documents by computer, is one of the major fields of research in computational linguistics The task of creating a document is extremely common in many fields of activity. Accordingly, there are many potential applications for NLG - almost any document creation task could potentially be automated by an NLG system. Advanced forms of NLG could also be used to generate a document in multiple languages, or as an output interface for other programs, which might ordinarily produce a less-manageable collection of data. They may also be able to create documents tailored to the needs of individual users. This thesis deals with document structure, a recent theory which describes those aspects of a document&#8217;s layout which affect its meaning. As well as its theoretical interest, it is a useful intermediate representation in the process of NLG. There is a well-defined process for generating a document structure using constraint programming. We show how this process can be made considerably more efficient. This in turn allows us to extend the document structuring task to allow for summarisation and finer control of the document layout. This thesis is organised as follows. Firstly, we review the necessary background material in both natural language processing and constraint programming.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">natural language generation, NLG, natural language processing, computational linguistics, document structuresummarization, document layout, constraint programming</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.infodiv.unimelb.edu.au/00003798/01/thesis.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/1700</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Look wide - searching for health in the borderlands: experiences of disease prevention and health promotion in a Central Australian indigenous settlement</field><field name="creator">Mann,  Rosemary Helen</field><field name="description">Until recently, place has been of little interest to health research.  While fundamental to anthropological accounts, place has been largely relegated to the bounded and inert ground on which human agency is exercised.  In this dissertation the relationship between people and the places in which they live is brought to the foreground. I am interested in bridging the gap between human agency and the social structures that underpin health by examining the subjective experiences and narrative accounts of individuals linked to the social organisation of places and their histories.  The social theory of Pierre Bourdieu and his concepts of habitus, field and capital, brings analysis of these health encounters closer to the experience of everyday practice.  The broader interest that runs in the background of the thesis is the interplay between the social determinants of health, the capacity to act and health inequality.  Based in the Warlpiri settlement of Yuendumu in Central Australia, the ethnography critically examines the engagement between Indigenous understandings of health, well-being and being ill, and the dominant biomedical discourse that shapes disease prevention and health promotion interventions.  Against a landscape of a rapidly changing Warlpiri social world, the search for Indigenous health extends beyond the biomedical life world and into the tensions of a wider social context.  These sites of engagement  are imagined as borderlands - emergent intra-cultural meeting places between yapa and kardiya.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Aboriginal Australians, health and hygiene, Northern Territory - Yuendumu</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.infodiv.unimelb.edu.au/00003610/01/Mann._R.H..pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/1806</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sleep disordered breathing in stable methadone maintenance treatment patients</field><field name="creator">Wang, David</field><field name="description">Methadone is a long acting mu-opioid and is the most effective treatment for heroin addiction.

Welfare agencies seeking long term home based care for children of parents with mental illness (among other groups of children) report that potential caregivers are concerned about  the child&#8217;s genetic risk, and the requirement that they facilitate access visits with the birth parent.   Consequently it is more difficult to recruit caregivers to care for children of parents with mental illness.   Previous studies found that families who adopt children with special needs had family systems that were flexible and able to adapt to changing needs, and in which family members felt close to one another. It was not known if the functioning of families who care for children of parents with mental illness would differ from other family groups.

The term &#8220;crouch gait&#8221; in the literature has been defined by many authors to mean a flexed knee coupled with many different combinations of posture at the ankle.  Consequently it was necessary to provide a robust definition of crouch gait before the outcome study could proceed.  Crouch gait was defined in the context of a classification of sagittal gait patterns in spastic diplegia.  In the cross-sectional study on the classification of sagittal gait patterns, 187 children with spastic diplegia were categorised according to visual recognition of their gait pattern and sagittal plane kinematic data.  Six gait patterns in spastic diplegia were identified, one of which was crouch gait.  A pattern of increasing age, severity and biomechanical incompetency in maintaining an extended posture was seen across the gait patterns and crouch gait appeared to be the &#8220;end&#8221; gait pattern.  A longitudinal study documented how the identified gait patterns evolved over time.  Thirty-four children were followed for more than one year and the results indicated that the stability of the gait pattern was variable.  The reliability of the classification was found to be acceptable.

For women, it is often considered in terms of menopause and the end of fecundity and fertility. I propose that women&#8217;s experience of midlife is much broader than this; instead, it is characterised by transformation in multiple domains and health status is important. I suggest that the continuity theory of ageing is useful when conceptualising the life course. The concept of habitus enables exploration of how identity is re/constructed during the ageing process in response to changing bodily circumstances, such as health problems.

Results of interviews with students in junior, middle and senior secondary-schools in Australia are presented alongside those from students studying IT at two universities. This research provides relevant and current insight into reasons why females are not choosing IT courses to the same extent as males, that is not captured in the existing literature. The study found that many young women and men, while being almost equal in IT use and computer literacy, do not consider IT as a valid and independent discipline for future study or as a career. It found that IT rarely entered students&#8217; schematic repertoire of possible future careers, a schematic repertoire strongly influenced by parental opinion at all stages of education.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">gender, IT, career choice</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.infodiv.unimelb.edu.au/00004306/01/FinalFeb08.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/1772</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The doctor as moral agent, with reference to the distinction between killing and "letting die"</field><field name="creator">Cooper, Denise Anne</field><field name="description">In the bioethics literature, arguments about the nature of the distinction between killing and &#8220;letting die&#8221; seem irresolvable.

Consequently, there is an increasing need to breed eucalypts with improved wood properties. Since many high value wood traits are under strong genetic control, identification of DNA markers linked to these traits will have application in breeding programs. In recent years there has been a shift in marker strategy away from QTL mapping in pedigrees to association studies in unrelated populations. In the latter approach, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in candidate genes are screened to identify SNPs that significantly associate with wood traits. Significant SNPs could be used for marker-assisted selection (MAS) in breeding programs. The objectives of this study were to identify candidate genes that may influence pulp yield in eucalypts and to identify SNP variants in those genes that associate with superior wood and pulp traits.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Eucalyptus nitens, Eucalyptus grandis, tree farms in Australia, pulping, paper</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/3637</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/3637</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A case study of gifted education in an Australian primary school: teacher attitudes, professional discourses and gender</field><field name="creator">Galitis, Ingrid</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates the professional knowledge and views about gifted education held by teachers working in a suburban primary school in Melbourne, Australia. Examining discourses of giftedness and intelligence, it adopts a case study approach to explore teachers&#8217; gendered understanding of these concepts four years after they undertook a program of professional development in gifted education during the late 1990s. The analysis of the case study is located in relation to historical as well as current policy and professional debates regarding the education of gifted children, and the context of broader contemporary educational reforms. During the 1990s, much educational reform in Australia, as elsewhere, was characterised by neo-liberal practices of devolution, and a greater emphasis on individual accountability that altered school management structures and directed curriculum practices towards a focus on outcomes-based education. The increasing scrutiny of teaching and learning became normalised as both teachers and students were regularly monitored and measured.

Among commercial fishermen of the Gippsland Lakes in Victoria (Australia), I show that social facts are generated by agents-acting-in-settings, and that aspects of fishermen&#8217;s collective practice and representation are informed by such local contingencies as &#8216;who you are, what you are up to, and with whom&#8217;. The neighbourhood, I argue, is realised in performance, during everyday encounters in occupational contexts such as &#8216;on the lake&#8217; or &#8216;down at the Co-op&#8217;. But fishermen also imagine togetherness, in different contexts, through the construction of conceptual boundaries, by identifying themselves as, for instance, &#8216;a fourth generation lake fisherman&#8217;. These two modes of conceiving how one belongs to a community &#8211; through performance or via recourse to structural ideals, produce remarkably different ways of viewing the world, relating to other people, and relating to one&#8217;s surrounds. On the one hand, a community constituted by social interaction relies on action in the present and a view towards ongoing future interactions between community members. This mode of belonging is dynamic and is characterised by movement, towards others and towards the future.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">anthropology, ethnography, fisheries, fishing community, belonging, place, social relationships, Gippsland Lakes</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/2425</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The weather and climate of Australia at the Last Glacial Maximum</field><field name="creator">Hope, Pandora</field><field name="description">The global climate has experienced four glacial cycles in the last 420,000 years, with each cycle characterised by a prolonged period of cooling culminating in maximal glaciation followed by a brief warm period.

High-frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) has been advocated as a lung protective mode of ventilation. But, even when HFOV is applied with a high lung volume strategy, the reductions in chronic lung disease are modest at best. In general, this is because standard high lung volume strategies do not account for the complex relationship between pressure and lung volume.

These events highlight the competing demands for limited marine resources.  Recent emphasis for the ecologically sustainable management of commercial fisheries has stimulated attempts to manage fisheries by incorporating knowledge of trophic interactions and ecosystem functioning, known as ecosystem-based fisheries management.  Seabirds are often highly visible, wide-ranging upper trophic level consumers that aggregate in areas of increased ocean productivity and therefore be used as natural monitors of marine environmental conditions.  Further, many seabirds commonly fed on commercially-exploited fish stocks (often targeting prey of similar size).  In this study, the population dynamics of Australasian gannets (Morus serrator) breeding in Port Phillip Bay, Victoria, is investigated and competition between gannets and commercial fisheries is determined.  In addition, the potential use of seabird reproductive and population parameters as indicators of the abundance of commercially exploited fish stocks, and pelagic conditions generally, is assessed.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australasian gannets, Morus serrator, breeding, fisheries, seabirds, marine resources, Port Phillip Bay</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/2843</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/2843</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">In what ways are year one students able to represent their mathematical understanding?</field><field name="creator">Deagan, Bronwyn</field><field name="description">The early years of schooling are a crucial part of a student&#8217;s education.  Recent years have seen the implementation of new literacy and numeracy programs in primary school classrooms.  The key area of mathematics (numeracy) has been closely monitored and funded by political and educational bodies (Clarke, Cheeseman, Gervasoni, Gronn, Horne, McDonough, Montgomery, Roche, Sullivan, Clarke, &amp; Rowley, 2002; Association of Independent Schools of South Australia, 2004).  The new numeracy programs have been introduced into the school curriculum to ensure that all students&#8217; needs are catered for in the classroom program.  However, standardised testing using pencil and paper is still being used as the accepted form of assessment.  The Victorian State Government uses the Achievement Improvement Monitor (AIM) to assess students&#8217; mathematical achievement levels.  This pencil and paper test is conducted for students in years three, five, seven and nine and is used to sort the students into a percentile group.  Other than the &#8216;Early Numeracy in the Classroom&#8217; program (2002) used by Victorian schools as a prep. to three program, where a one-on-one interview is used as a form of assessment, there is currently no program that offers students the opportunity to choose how best to represent their own mathematical understanding.

I begin by arguing that reasons are open; what gives them direction is how they feature in my life and weigh with me. Of course, this does not tell us what reasons are available to a person when they act. In this connection I argue against Bernard Williams&#8217; internal reasons thesis, showing that there are occasions when we will want to say someone has a reason to act even though they are unable to see it. Continuing with Williams, I explore moral necessity, drawing also on the works of Winch, Rhees and Cordner, arguing that Williams too readily conflates psychological with ethical limits. In particular, the possibility of recanting what we took to be necessary should inform our view of moral necessity, since it can show that I had misconstrued the nature of the limits I took myself to have reached. Following this use of recantation, I explore narrative in detail, arguing that my narrative is partly constitutive of who I am. My agency is therefore interpretive. This has ramifications for thinkers such as Christine Korsgaard and Jonathan Dancy, whose work I explore in two excursuses.

The concept of evidence-based health practice has provided a structure on which the clinically-relevant questions in this debate can be dealt with systematically. When clinicians are faced with choices of which treatment regimen should be offered to patients, the central issues that should be considered are effectiveness, complications, patient/operator preference/satisfaction, and cost. Systematic review and meta-analysis techniques were used to reach definitive conclusions where high quality primary studies are available. The issue of satisfaction was studied using a quality of life concept, while the issue of cost was addressed by an economic evaluation (cost-minimization analysis). Treatment effectiveness and complications of single- and multiple-visit approach were similar. Patients overwhelmingly preferred single- over multiple-visit treatment with high satisfaction scores for both regimens. Australian endodontists were reluctant to embrace single-visit root canal treatment. Single-visit root canal treatment costs society less than multiple-visit treatment.

Real-space Rietveld analysis of geopolymers crystallised at high temperature is used to back-calculate and analyse the original geopolymer structure, and the primary change in very short-range structure from the as-synthesised geopolymer to the high-temperature crystalline product is observed to be a shift in the location of the extraframework charge-balancing cation.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">geopolymer, alkali-activated, aluminosilicate, reaction kinetics, nanostructure</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.infodiv.unimelb.edu.au/00001945/01/John_Provis_Thesis_final.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/342</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">High resolution phase contrast x-ray radiography</field><field name="creator">Arhatari, Benedicta Dewi</field><field name="description">The conventional approach for x-ray radiography is absorption contrast. In recent years a new approach that eliminates the usual requirement for absorption and allows the visualization of phase based on refractive index features in a material has been demonstrated. This so-called &#8220;phase contrast imaging&#8221; has now been applied using a wide range of radiation and samples. In this work we are motivated by the need to find optimal conditions for achieving high quality phase contrast images. We consider image formation using the free space propagation of x-rays from a point source passing through a sample. This imaging model is a lens-less configuration and, as such, is very useful for x-ray wavelengths where lenses are difficult to fabricate. Although no lenses are used, image magnification is still achieved due to the expansion of the wavefront as it propagates from the point source illumination. The short wavelength and penetrating power of x-rays make them ideal for non-destructive studies of microscopic samples. However, these techniques are also important for investigating larger, non-microscopic samples.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">x-ray, radiography phase, contrast visibility phase</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.infodiv.unimelb.edu.au/00001937/01/bene_thesis_rev_jun06.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/338</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Transition from secondary school to university</field><field name="creator">Hillman,  Robert P.</field><field name="description">Transition between secondary school and university can be a time of stress and anxiety.

The study was conducted in three stages, the survey, in-depth interviews and radio talk-back. The survey was conducted with schoolgirls in all four public senior secondary schools in Gaborone, Botswana. The survey was completed first before proceeding to the other two stages. However, the last two stages were done concurrently. A quantitative survey was conducted with 600 schoolgirls (18-22-year-olds) in order to establish their sexual practices, find out the prevalence of intergenerational sexual relationships among them and find out their perceptions regarding intergenerational sexual relationships. More than three-quarters of the participants had boyfriends in their age group and about one-quarter of those who were approached by older men had older boyfriends. The results revealed the practice of multiple sexual partners both in intragenerational and intergenerational sexual relationships. The issue of multiple sexual partners has been identified to be one of the factors that fuel STI/HIV infections. Girls who were in intergenerational sexual relationships have positive perceptions and attitudes towards them. However, the majority of the girls did not perceive such relationships as good. They associated them with the danger of engaging in unprotected sex and thus a greater risk of contracting STI/HIV.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">intergenerational sex-Botswana</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.infodiv.unimelb.edu.au/00002295/01/IGSR_in_urban_Botswana_MS_Word.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/705</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Unadjudicated claims to equitable interests under a constructive trust: their assessment as property under the pension assets test</field><field name="creator">O'Connor, Pamela Anne</field><field name="description">The Social Security Act 1991 incorporates the general legal meaning of property in its definition of an asset, for the purpose of the pension means test.  This creates the opportunity for pension applicants to argue that assessable assets held by them should be reduced by the amount of any equitable proprietry rights held by others in the assets.  The Federal Court has held in Kintominas v Secretary, DSS and in Kidner v Secretary, DSS that equitable proprietry claims under remedial doctrines, such as under the constructive trust doctrine discussed in Baumgartner v Baumgartner are to be regarded as property even though there has been no judicial declaration of their existence, no dispute between the legal owner and the person claiming an equitabe interest, an no unconscionable abuse of title rights by the legal owner. This thesis argues that the Federal Court&#8217;s approach is not the preferable one, for three main reasons. The first relates to the changing nature of the constructive trust to a necessary element. The second is that, at a time when the constructive trust in Australia is in transition from the traditional institutional conception to a remedial paradigm along North American lines, the beneficial interest should no longer be viewed as existing independently of a judicial decree.  The third argument is that, even if an equitable interest under a remedial constructive trust is accepted as existing independently of a curial declaration, it cannot be valued for the purposes of the assets test.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">constructive trusts in Australia, equitable remedies, Federal Court of Australia, Social Security Act 1991</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.infodiv.unimelb.edu.au/00002233/01/O'Connor.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/587</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The structure and thermal evolution of metakaolin geopolymers</field><field name="creator">Duxson, Peter</field><field name="description">Geopolymers are a relatively new class of material that has many broad applications, including use as a substitute for Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC), use in soil stabilisation, fire resistant panels, refractory cements, and inorganic adhesives.

However, despite uncertainty estimates of order 1%, differences of 2-10% between x-ray mass attenuation measurements render comparison with the various theoretical tabulations meaningless.  Moreover, such uncertainties impose limits on the accuracy of various quantitative investigations. We determine the imaginary component of the atomic form-factor from measurements of the x-ray mass attenuation coefficient.  With the exception of the measurements of Tran et.al. [Phys. Rev. A 64, (062506); 67, (042716); J. Phys. B 38, (89)] with a 0.3% accuracy, previous work has been unable to achieve accuracies below 1%, and differences between results claiming this accuracy often exceed 6%.We have developed a full-foil mapping technique which has improved the measurement accuracy by an order of magnitude.  This technique overcomes limitations arising from absorber thickness variations, using the average integrated column density and attenuation measurements across the entire surface of the absorber.  We have examined measurements obtained over a wide range of parameter space for systematic deviations indicative of experimental error.  Among others, this has led to the identification and correction of a 1% discrepancy arising from the x-ray bandwidth.  Resulting measurement accuracies for molybdenum are 0.02-0.15%.  Preliminary results for tin suggest a final accuracy of 0.1-1%.

The notion that a person as an autonomous being has a right to decide whether or not to consent to medical treatment from an  informed basis has its origins in both law and ethical theory. In this research I investigate the issue of informed consent from two overall perspectives. The first concerns its basis in ethical theories of autonomy and its interpretation by the law and by health professional guidelines. The second involves an empirical examination of its occurrence within the communicative interaction between a physiotherapist and their patient, and its interpretation by the physiotherapist. I use qualitative research methods involving analysis of individual audio-taped treatment encounters in private physiotherapy practice and interviews with the treating physiotherapist. A central tenet of this study is that the translation of both legal and ethical criteria into the context of the clinical encounter requires a process of negotiation and communicative interaction between the patient and health professional. This research seeks to understand this process, and the factors that influence it in the specific context of physiotherapists and the private practice clinical encounter.

In this thesis I interrogate the treatment (including bullying, harassment and lack of acknowledgment of the gay experience), in schools, of boys who express gender unorthodoxy/non-hegemonic masculinities. In order to understand this behaviour I look at the means of control of such expressions as exercised by other students and teachers and explore the motivation behind this control.

Knowledge of the spectral nature of the Floquet operator gives us information on the dynamics of such systems. The work presented here on the spectrum of the Floquet operator gives further insight into the nature of chaos in quantum mechanics. After discussing the links between the spectrum, dynamics and chaos and pointing out an ambiguity in the physics literature, I present a number of new mathematical results on the existence of different types of spectra of the Floquet operator. I characterise the conditions for which the spectrum remains pure point and then, on relaxing these conditions, show the emergence of a continuous spectral component. The nature of the continuous spectrum is further analysed, and shown to be singularly continuous. Thus, the dynamics of these systems are a candidate for classification as chaotic.  A conjecture on the emergence of a continuous spectral component is linked to a long standing number-theoretic conjecture on the estimation of finite exponential sums.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">spectral analysis, quantum chaos, Floquet operator, number theory</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.infodiv.unimelb.edu.au/00000848/01/JMcCaw_Phd_Thesis_2005.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/1026</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The politics of educational disadvantage: the impact of central government policies on secondary schools' capacities to improve educational outcomes for their socially disadvantaged students</field><field name="creator">Morrow,  Ann</field><field name="description">This thesis uses the Advocacy Coalition Framework (ACF) developed by Sabatier and Jenkins-Smith (1993) to analyse the politics of educational disadvantage in Australia. The historical influence of two competing coalitions at Commonwealth and at State level in New South Wales and Victoria is traced. For most of the 20th century there has been a dominant conservative coalition and a minority coalition that has favoured reforms to assist socially disadvantaged groups in each of the three jurisdictions. However, the composition of these contending coalitions and their relative strengths have varied substantially from State to State. The theoretical model provided by the ACF was supplemented by explorations of Halligan and Power&#8217;s (1992) &#8216;regime dynamics&#8217; framework which helps explain these differences in terms of the differing politico-administrative cultures of Victoria and New South Wales.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">higher education in Australia, politics and education in Australia, higher education of people with social disabilities in Australia, educational equalization in Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.infodiv.unimelb.edu.au/00000841/01/morrow.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/1023</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Survival and regeneration in the deaf ear: the potential of neurotrophic factors</field><field name="creator">Gillespie, Lisa N.</field><field name="description">Spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) within the cochlea degenerate following the loss of the auditory sensory epithelium, the auditory hair cells.  Since these neurons are the target cells of the cochlear implant, which bypasses damaged or lost hair cells to stimulate the SGNs directly, enhanced SGN number and integrity may provide enhanced outcomes for cochlear implant patients.  Improved contact between the cochlear implant electrode array and the auditory nerve fibres is also likely to enhance the benefits received by cochlear implant patients.  Therefore, the identification of molecules with the capacity to support SGN survival and stimulate axonal growth has significant clinical implications.  Based on their roles in the development and maintenance of the auditory system, some neurotrophic factors are expected to play an important role in enhancing the survival of auditory elements following deafening. This thesis investigates various molecules for their capacity to stimulate and guide the growth of SGN axons, and also investigates the survival-promoting effects of specific neurotrophic factors on SGN survival in clinically relevant animal models of deafness. Two neurotrophic factors were identified specifically to stimulate axonal growth from SGNs in an in vitro model of deafness.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">auditory, neurotrophic factor, neuron survival</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.infodiv.unimelb.edu.au/00001472/01/THESIS-LNGillespie.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/1054</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Factors influencing the vocational decision making of high-ability adolescent girls</field><field name="creator">Lea-Wood,  Sandra S.</field><field name="description">The current study is the first of its kind in Australia.

This thesis develops methods for assessing the quality and variability of data from such experiments and for incorporating these assessments into algorithms for discovering differential expression.  The variability of microarray data depends not only on the quality of the arrays, but also on how they are processed and normalised. The intimate relationship between variability of expression log-ratios and the method used for background correcting the expression values is specifically explored. The performance of different estimators of the background level and various model-based processing methods, including a novel normal-exponential convolution model are compared in search of a &#8216;best&#8217; alternative.  The results indicate that the choice of method should be guided by the specific question of interest; the model-based methods give gene expression measures with low bias, and do very well at choosing differentially expressed genes, while subtracting low background estimates, or not background correcting the data produces low variance estimates which are the most biased, however perform best at choosing DE genes.  All of these alternatives give better results than those obtained by the standard approach of subtracting high local background estimates from the foreground signal, which is not recommended.

Much of this energy, particularly in Australia, is derived from fossil fuels and its consumption results in the emission of greenhouse gases that contribute to an enhanced greenhouse effect causing global warming. The need to reduce the energy consumed by residential and commercial buildings is now widely recognised. This has been acknowledged by state and federal governments within Australia and has resulted in strategies intended to increase the efficiency of building construction and operation. The focus of this research has been the place where most Australians live - suburban residential buildings.Residential buildings consume energy in their operation, for space heating and cooling, water heating, refrigeration, cooking, lighting, appliance, and equipment use. However, energy, known as embodied energy, is also expended in the production of basic building materials, the manufacture of building components, the construction of buildings and their maintenance. Described as life cycle energy, the operational energy and the embodied energy accumulating throughout the lifetime of buildings, account for the total energy attributable to them. Previous studies have indicated that the embodied energy of buildings may be a significant component of their lifetime energy. Therefore, a focus solely on their operational energy efficiency may not necessarily result in lifetime energy reductions.The aim of this research, therefore, was to identify and rank the critical factors influencing the lifetime energy of typical low and medium density suburban residential buildings within temperate regions of Australia. To achieve this, several buildings, representative of the dwelling types currently constructed in the suburbs of Melbourne, were selected for study. Factors influencing operational energy and embodied energy were identified. Thermal simulations were conducted for all dwellings to determine their space heating and cooling requirements as each of the factors was varied from base case values. Residential non space heating and cooling energy was determined from Australian statistics.  The embodied energy of the dwellings was calculated using methods adapted from the work of other researchers. As for space conditioning energy simulations, the embodied energy was determined for the base case and then for versions in which factors previously identified were varied. Finally, the life cycle energy requirements of the dwellings were determined for a number of low, base case and high energy scenarios. Statistical analyses of operational energy, embodied energy and life cycle energy results were used to determine and then rank the critical factors influencing each. It has been demonstrated that both user behaviour and building design and construction factors critically influence the life cycle energy requirements of the selected residential dwellings in Melbourne, Australia. As an indicator of the importance of building lifetime, factors found to be critical at one stage of the life cycle of a dwelling have been shown to become less critical at another stage. The results also demonstrate that the life cycle energy requirements of dwellings can be reduced  significantly through the synergistic operation of a number of the factors identified.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">domestic architecture, energy conservation in buildings, architecture and energy conservation, Australian architecture</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.infodiv.unimelb.edu.au/00000382/01/faythesis.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/1161</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The educational theory of Dmitri Kabalevsky in relation to his piano music for children</field><field name="creator">Forrest,  David Lawrence</field><field name="description">This study investigates the educational theories and beliefs of the Russian composer and educator Dmitri Borisovich Kabalevsky as they relate to his piano music for children.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Kabalevsky, Dmitry Borisovich, piano music for children, music instruction and study</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.infodiv.unimelb.edu.au/00000385/01/forrestthesis.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/1164</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Optical crosstalk in WDM fibre-radio networks</field><field name="creator">Castleford, David</field><field name="description">The predicted growth in mobile phone traffic and the move towards enhanced mobility will lead to a need for a wireless infrastructure that provides increasing bandwidth per user.

The framework emphasises the importance of teachers using cooperative learning as a structure to enable students to think together. Therefore, analysis focuses on cooperative learning in a classroom context and the teachers&#8217; units of work guiding the tasks they create.

Like the films themselves, this protagonist has largely been understood as an allegorical embodiment of a bleak post-World War Two mood of anxiety and disillusionment. Theorists have consistently attributed his pessimism, alienation, paranoia and fatalism to the concurrent American cultural climate. With its themes of murder, illicit desire, betrayal, obsession and moral dissolution, the noir canon also proves conducive to psychoanalytic interpretation. By oedipalising the noir hero and the cinematic text in which he is embedded, this approach at best has produced exemplary noir criticism, but at worst a tendency to universalise his trajectory. This thesis proposes a complementary and newly historicised critical paradigm with which to interpret the noir hero. Such an exegesis encompasses a number of social, aesthetic, demographic and political forces reaching back to the nineteenth century. This will reveal the centrality of modernity in shaping the noir heros ontology. The noir hero will also be connected to the flaneur, a figure who embodied the changes of modernity and who emerged in the mid-nineteenth century as both an historical entity and a critical metaphor for the new subject.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">film noir, men in motion pictures, hardboiled hero, film history and criticism, noir hero, modernity, femme fatale</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.infodiv.unimelb.edu.au/00000122/01/latestall_Nolan.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/1338</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Deaf children's understanding of the roles of speakers and listeners in face-to-face interaction</field><field name="creator">Jeanes,  Raymond Christian</field><field name="description">The ability to communicate effectively requires individuals to possess knowledge in a number of areas as well as the skill to apply this knowledge in a wide range of practical communication contexts.

Three-quarters of the Basin lies offshore and the rest onshore. The basin was initiated as a rift valley, caused by the separation of the Australian continent from the Antarctic followed by a number of tectonic events throughout the basin history. Early Cretaceous sedimentary rocks form the basement, which is in turn covered with Late Cretaceous to Recent sediment of sand, clay, limestone, and brown coal seams. The total thickness of the in-filling sediments offshore attains up to 6000 m, but onshore is up to 1200 m. There are three main acquifer systems, the Hydrostratigraphic Units 2, 4, and 7, all of which are confined. The two lower aquifer systems, Units 4 and 7, contain high temperature groundwater. It is generally agreed that the hydrocarbons offshore have been derived from terrestrial matters including brown coal and ligneous clay offshore. In the present study, the author has developed a case that hydrocarbons offshore being derived not only from the offshore source but also from onshore brown coals and coaly matter and in this hydrocarbon forming processes, groundwater has played a significant role. The Central Deep, in particular, provides favourable conditions for hydrocarbon maturation. Throughout the basin history, the Central Deep has experienced the oil window temperatures. In supporting this hypothesis, geochemical studies on groundwater, brown coal, and hydrocarbons as well as hydrodynamics are presented.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">hydrogeology in the Gippsland Basin, Victoria,  petroleum geology in the Gippsland Basin, Victoria</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.infodiv.unimelb.edu.au/00003682/01/Nahm_G[1].Y._Dr..pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/1565</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The coordination of nickel in hyperaccumulating plants</field><field name="creator">Callahan, Damien L.</field><field name="description">The co-ordination of Ni in hyperaccumulator plants was investigated using a number of mass spectrometry (MS)-based analytical techniques.  Initial field studies on nickeliferous (lateritic) soils in Western Australia failed to identify plants containing elevated metal concentrations.  For this reason, Ni-hyperaccumulators were collected from known ultramafic sites in New Caledonia, as well as grown under controlled conditions.  Using electrospray ionization MS a Ni-nicotianamine (Ni-NA) complex [NiII(C12H20N3O6)]+ was identified in the South African Ni-hyperaccumulator Berkheya coddii.  The association between Ni and NA was examined further in a range of Thlaspi species which accumulate different concentrations of Ni and Zn in their foliar tissues.  In order to quantitate the concentration of NA a new liquid chromatography-MS (LC-MS) based analytical protocol was developed which allowed the quantification of NA and free amino acids.  From the analysis of the leaf tissue in Thlaspi a strong correlation emerged between Ni and NA but not Zn.  This suggested that NA plays a role in the transport of Ni in Ni-hyperaccumulating Thlaspi plants.  An inverse proportionality was found between Fe and Ni.  Higher NA production could be related to maintenance of Fe homeostasis.  A correlation was also found between Zn and asparagine.  These results are consistent with the operation of separate transport mechanisms for Ni and Zn. Further extreme examples of Ni-hyperaccumulation were also examined using LC-MS and metabolite profiling based on gas chromatography-MS (GC-MS).

This rise is due to increases in electrode impedance which in turn is suggested to be a result of tissue growth around the electrode array.  The foreign body response initiated by the immune system encapsulates the array in a matrix of fibrous tissue, separating the electrode array from the rest of the body.  A second change in electrode impedance occurs with the onset of electrical stimulation.  A transitory reduction in impedance has been recorded in animals and humans after stimulation of electrodes.  Impedance returns to pre-stimulation levels following the cessation of stimulation.  It was suggested that these changes in impedance with stimulation were also related to the tissue growth around the electrode array.

The high public profile of these species places socio-political constraints on the management options available. The use of fertility control techniques appears to offer an alternative.  However, before a contraceptive system can be developed a detailed knowledge of the reproductive processes for that species must be generated.  In this thesis, sexual maturity, seasonal reproduction, aspects of the endocrinology of reproduction and fertility control were investigated in the eastern grey kangaroo.  In Victoria the eastern grey kangaroo is capable of breeding at all times of the year, although breeding is more synchronous than in northern populations, with 41% of the females breeding between December and January. In Victorian populations the onset of sexual maturity is delayed in both sexes, with females reaching maturity at 22 &#177; 1.2months and some males not reaching sexual maturity by 32 months of age.   Male kangaroos showed seasonal changes that closely tracked the reproductive activity of the female kangaroos. Plasma testosterone concentrations were significantly elevated during the peak breeding period compared to all other times of the year.  Both prostate and testis weights were low during winter when the reproductive activity of the females is low, although the difference was not significant.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">fertility of the Eastern grey kangaroo in Victoria, control of the eastern grey kangaroo in Victoria</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.infodiv.unimelb.edu.au/00003587/01/Nave_C.D..pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/1728</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Continental tectonics and landscape evolution in south-central Australia and southern Tibet</field><field name="creator">Quigley, Mark Cameron</field><field name="description">The Indo-Australian Plate is actively deforming at its margins and within its interior. In south-central Australia, more than 3000 km from the closest active plate boundary, a geomorphically rugged and apparently youthful mountain range has developed, rising up to 1.1km above the adjacent flat-lying outback plains. These &#8216;Flinders&#8217; and &#8216;Barrier&#8217; Ranges are seismically active and bound by major reverse fault scarps with clear evidence for Plio-Quaternary displacements, implying that young and active intraplate tectonism has played a fundamental role in their development. Palaeoseismic investigations and optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) chronology indicate faulting occurred in response to a series of large magnitude (~M6.6 to M7.3) palaeo-earthquakes with recurrence intervals of ~1:20,000 to~1:80,000 yrs and long-term fault slip rates of ~50 m Myr-1. Geomorphic observations and 10Becosmogenic nuclide dating indicate surprisingly high and spatially variable rates of bedrock erosion from fault-affected catchments in the Flinders Ranges. Slowly eroding bedrock summit surfaces have been uplifted up to 12 m in the last 60,000-100,000 years relative to more rapidly eroding valley floors and bounding piedmonts, indicating Late Quaternary increases in elevation and relief in response to intraplate tectonism and erosion. However, both facies changes and sediment aggradation-dissection cycles in alluvial fan sequences are out-of-synch within dividual tectonic events, indicating that an aspect of climate (aridification, changing flood frequency-magnitude distributions) has governed the spatial-temporal distribution of range front sedimentation.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">active tectonics, erosion, cosmogenic nuclide, optically stimulated luminescence, argon, Australia, Tibet</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.infodiv.unimelb.edu.au/00002963/01/Thesis_archival.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/1695</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Damage identification and condition assessment of civil engineering structures through response measurement</field><field name="creator">Bayissa, Wirtu</field><field name="description">This research study presents a new vibration-based non-destructive global structural damage identification and condition monitoring technique that can be used for detection, localization and quantification of damage.

In the first stage, performance assessment of various response parameters obtained from the time-domain, frequency-domain and spectral-domain analysis is conducted using a non model-based damage detection and localization approach. In addition, vibration response parameters that are sensitive to local and global damage and that possess strong physical relationships with key structural dynamic properties are identified. Moreover, in order to overcome the difficulties associated with damage identification in the presence of structural nonlinearity and response nonstationarity, a wavelet transform based damage-sensitive parameter is presented for detection and localization of damage in the space domain. The level of sensitivity and effectiveness of these parameters for detection and localization of damage are demonstrated using various numerical experimental data determined from one-dimensional and two-dimensional plate-like structures.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">two-stage damage identification, structural health monitoring, non model-based, model-based, vibration test, spectral density, statistical moments, wavelets, adaptive simulated annealing, modal analysis, broadband frequency, damage-sensitve parameter, random vibration</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.infodiv.unimelb.edu.au/00003631/01/Master_document_final_copy_after_examination.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/1847</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">High-Performance Visual Closed-Loop Robot Control</field><field name="creator">Corke, Peter Ian</field><field name="description">This thesis addresses the use of monocular eye-in-hand machine vision to control the position of a robot manipulator for dynamically challenging tasks.

The relationship between mission schools and social, political and religious change has been reviewed in case studies of African, Asian and Pacific nations. The New Hebrides provides a unique opportunity to study the development of mission education policies in a territory in which government assistance and control over education was completely absent. On most of the islands of the New Hebrides group, the history of education from 1848 to 1948 is the history of Presbyterian Mission education.The New Hebrides Presbyterian Mission possessed neither the resources nor the policies necessary for the task of providing a broadly based national education system. Yet for more than a century, civil administrations left the entire responsibility for the provision of education in the hands of the Christian missions. The Presbyterian Mission willingly accepted this responsibility.

The conventional approach to testing structural models has involved the use of observable data to proxy the latent capital structure process, which may introduce additional specification error. This study extends Jones, Mason &amp; Rosenfeld (1983) and Eom, Helwege &amp; Huang (2004) by using implicit estimation of key model parameters resulting in an improved level of model fit. Unlike prior studies, the models are fitted from the observed dynamic term structure of firm-specific credit spreads, thereby providing a pure test of model specification. The models are implemented by adapting the method of Duffee (1999) to structural credit models, thereby treating the capital structure process is truly latent, and simultaneously enforcing cross-sectional and time-series model constraints. Quasi-maximum likelihood parameter estimates of the capital structure process are obtained via the extended Kalman filter applied to actual market trade prices on 32 firms and 200 bonds for the period 1994 to 2000.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">credit risk, credit spreads, bond pricing, structural models, Merton, Kalman filter</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.infodiv.unimelb.edu.au/00003878/01/maclachl_thesis_final.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/2043</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analysis and optimization of MAC protocols for wireless networks</field><field name="creator">Shu, Feng</field><field name="description">Medium access control (MAC) plays a vital role in satisfying the varied quality of service (QoS) requirements in wireless networks.

Today the country has a total population of four million people (NSO 1991). Before colonisation, Papua New Guinea&#8217;s indigenous settlement patterns and social organisation reflected the fragmented nature of the country&#8217;s environment, its isolation from the eastern and western centres of civilisation, and the needs of small-scale subsistence economies. Over thousands of years, Melanesian societies have been too diverse for any particular area or group to typify the country&#8217;s culture or to maintain a dominant role within government. Deviance, regulatory mechanisms and methods used by each tribe or cultural group to resolve disputes, varied according to the community&#8217;s culture and customs. At the time of colonisation the indigenous people were artificially united in one nation-state. With the introduction of Western social, political, economic and judicial systems, they were forced to live under alien dispute resolution procedures and to accept an imposed Western system of sanctions, which overlaid or supplemented the customary dispute resolution procedures. Since colonisation, a Western legal system of sanctions has been imposed on Papua New Guineans in which the colonialists have overlooked traditional, unwritten customary systems.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">corrections, Papua New Guinea, deviant behavior, colonisation and legal systems</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.infodiv.unimelb.edu.au/00003903/01/Sikani_R..pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/2050</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Optical modelling of visual performance</field><field name="creator">Liou,  Hwey-Lan</field><field name="description">The aim of this thesis is to develop a method of optical modelling that can be used to predict visual performance of the eye.

In pursuit of this goal, the UN General Assembly has adopted numerous human rights treaties covering a vast array of rights.  Because it has the highest number of ratifications, the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CROC), is often lauded as the most successful of all the human rights treaties. Although the breadth and depth of human rights treaties is impressive, the amount of research into their effectiveness is not. Very little scholarship has been undertaken to evaluate the extent to which human rights treaties are being complied with by countries that have ratified them and whether ratification of a human rights treaty has a positive impact on the human rights situation within a State Party&#8217;s jurisdiction.  The research that has been undertaken has been largely quantitative and limited to studies of compliance with civil and political rights. This thesis builds on this limited scholarship by qualitatively analysing the &#8216;compliance&#8217; levels of two States, Australia and the United States, with the norm in Article 29(1) of CROC relating to human rights education (HRE). Although the United States has not ratified CROC, it was selected as one of the case studies for this research in order to enable comparison to be made between HRE in a State that has ratified CROC, and a State that has not, thereby shedding light on whether ratification of a human rights treaty makes a difference.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">human rights education, convention on the rights of the child, compliance with international human rights treaties</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.infodiv.unimelb.edu.au/00003989/01/Thesis_in_PDF_format.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/2173</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Generation Y: re-writing the rules on sex, love and consent</field><field name="creator">Powell, Anastasia</field><field name="description">This thesis explores the love/sex relationships of 117 young people (aged 14 to 24) of diverse sexualities from rural and urban Victoria.

For the young people participating in this research, the negotiation of safe and consensual sex means navigating these multiple and sometimes contradictory meanings. Young people are simultaneously positioned within social structures and in relation to gendered discourse, resulting in varying opportunity for active reflection and communication of what they and a partner might want from a sexual encounter.

This is generally due to lack of adequate comprehension of the concepts of agent technology. This thesis is based on the premise that the comprehension of the concepts of and the adoption of agent technology can be improved. Two approaches are explored: the first approach is the analysis and structuring of the interactions in multiagent systems; the second approach is sharing of experiences of what works and what does not in agent-oriented software engineering using software patterns. While analysis of interactions in multiagent systems improves the understanding of the behaviour of multiagent systems, sharing multiagent system development experience improves the understanding of the concepts of agent technology as well as the challenges that face the engineering of multiagent systems. It is therefore believed that interaction analysis and experience sharing can enhance the comprehension of agent technology and hence, the adoption of the technology by the wider community of software practitioners. This thesis addresses the challenges facing agent-oriented software engineering by presenting a dedicated approach for developing agent interaction protocols to guide the interactions in a multiagent system; and a comprehensive framework for classifying, analyzing and describing agent-oriented patterns for the purpose of sharing multiagent systems development experiences.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">agent-oriented software engineering, agent-oriented patterns, agent interaction protocols, classification scheme, description template</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.infodiv.unimelb.edu.au/00002780/01/PattsProtsAOSD-Thesis_200611.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/2273</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The tectonic history of the Ruker Province, southern Prince Charles Mountains, East Antarctica: implications for Gondwana and Rodinia</field><field name="creator">Phillips, Glen</field><field name="description">Within the Ruker Province of East Antarctica, there is evidence for several key geological events that have occurred coincidently with periods of dynamic earth evolution. A detailed evaluation of the tectonic history of the region is therefore required. This research focuses on the tectonic development of the Ruker Province. The main aspects of this research can be summarised as follows: (1) an evaluation of the gross crustal architecture of the region through the development of a new stratigraphic and structural framework; (2) new U-Th-Pb (LA-ICPMS) age data from detrital zircon grains extracted from thick metasedimentary units that comprise a major component of the Ruker Province; (3) new 40Ar/39Ar data from metamorphic minerals to determine the cooling history of the province; (4) mineral equilibria modelling of metamorphic mineral assemblages to constrain pressure-temperature (P-T) conditions during key orogenic events; (5) a kinematic analysis of brittle/ductile deformation features. Ideas developed from these new data provide inferences on the assembly and dispersion of the late Proterozoic super-continents Rodinia (c. 1000 Ma) and Gondwana (c. 500 Ma).</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">East Antarctica, Gondwana, tectonics, Rodinia,</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.infodiv.unimelb.edu.au/00003263/01/PhD_thesis_G.Phillips.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/2017</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The enactment and operation of the 1950 amendment to the Victorian Education Act</field><field name="creator">Newell, Phillip K.</field><field name="description">Prior to the passing of the Education (Religious Instruction) Act 1950, religious instruction was permitted in State schools in Victoria, but had to be given outside the hours prescribed for secular instruction.  Within these limitations, representatives of the non-Roman Catholic Churches provided basically non-sectarian teaching under the auspices of the Joint Council for Religious Instruction in State Schools. The 1940's, however, saw a growing dissatisfaction in the Churches with the secular nature of the Education Act and a desire for statutory recognition of the place of religion in the education of children.  Through the Joint Council and its successor, the Council for Christian Education in Schools, and through a series of conferences of the Heads of Churches begun in 1943, negotiations were initiated in order to seek common ground for an approach to the Government.  The Anglican desire for segregation and the unstable political situation were the biggest obstacles to progress. By 1950, after protracted negotiations and many disappointments, the member-Churches of the Council for Christian Education in Schools had reached agreement, and with Roman Catholic support, secured the 1950 Amendment.</field><field name="date">1968</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">church and state in Victoria, history of education in Victoria</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.infodiv.unimelb.edu.au/00004235/01/Newell._P.K..pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/2266</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Assimilation of satellite observations into coastal biogeochemical models</field><field name="creator">Turner, Matthew Robert John</field><field name="description">This thesis has investigated the improvement of forecasting temperature in a coastal embayment through the assimilation of sea surface temperature (SST) observations. The research was prompted by the increasing pressures on the coastal marine environment. To better manage the environment, an improved understanding of its future state is necessary. Improving the forecasting of temperature advances our knowledge in this direction. Whilst assimilation of SST is routinely carried out for oceans, its use has been minimal in coastal regions, which is more complicated because of anisotropic covariances and a breakdown of geostrophy in the coastal region. Improvements in computing power, and the introduction of ensemble-based assimilation techniques have made the approach followed in this thesis possible.

This is achieved by separable expansions of these potentials with a finite number of optimal form factors known as sturmians. The MCAS method has been applied previously in analyses of low-energy nucleon-nucleus scattering data for cases in which the nuclear target has low mass number, though in principle it can be used to analyse any discrete-body quantum scattering problem.

A particularly challenging problem is the engineering of various forms of interaction among agents. Interaction may be aimed at enabling agents to coordinate their activities, cooperate to reach common objectives, or exchange resources to better achieve their individual objectives. This thesis is concerned with negotiation: a process through which multiple self-interested agents can reach agreement over the exchange of scarce resources. In particular, I focus on settings where agents have limited or uncertain information, precluding them from making optimal individual decisions. I demonstrate that this form of bounded-rationality may lead agents to sub-optimal negotiation agreements. I argue that rational dialogue based on the exchange of arguments can enable agents to overcome this problem. Since agents make decisions based on particular underlying reasons, namely their interests, beliefs and planning knowledge, then rational dialogue over these reasons can enable agents to refine their individual decisions and consequently reach better agreements. I refer to this form of interaction as &#8220;interested-based negotiation.&#8221; (For complete abstract open document)</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">artificial intelligence, intelligent agents, multi-agent systems, automated negotiation, argumentation</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.infodiv.unimelb.edu.au/00001475/01/thesis.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/2885</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modelling the seasonal variation of groundwater recharge and yield of the Barwon Downs aquifer, south-western Victoria</field><field name="creator">Teng, Mee Lok</field><field name="description">The Barwon Downs Aquifer in south western Victoria has long been recognized to have extensive groundwater resources.

MWEs are arguably one of the biggest roadblocks in computational linguistics due to the bewildering range of syntactic, semantic, pragmatic and statistical idiomaticity they are associated with, and their high productivity. In addition, the large numbers in which they occur demand specialized handling.

Structural restrictiveness is determined by the rules embedded within computerized decision aids that restrict how users interact with the decision aid.  For example, a structurally-restrictive decision aids might force users to consider information and answer specific questions in a prescribed sequence.  In contrast, a less structurally-restrictive decision aid would be designed so that users are free to consider information in whatever sequence they desire.  The more structurally-restrictive design imposes more limits on users&#8217; decision-making process because they are forced to adapt their decision-making process to match the decision aid.  However, it is unclear whether restricting how users interact with decision aids affects their decision-making outcomes.  The results indicate that the more structurally-restrictive decision aid did not assist participants to identify more prompted items compared with the less structurally-restrictive decision aid.  However, it increased the decision-making bias in recalling non-prompted items.

The role of neural 5-HT has been difficult to isolate with current techniques. This thesis aimed to elucidate the role of 5-HT neurons in motility using anatomical and functional methods. In Chapter 2, confocal microscopy was used to examine over 95% of myenteric neurons in guinea pig jejunum, categorized neurochemically, to identify neurons that received anatomically-defined input from 5-HT interneurons. The data showed that cholinergic secretomotor neurons were strongly targeted by 5-HT interneurons. In another key finding, excitatory motor neurons were surrounded by 5-HT terminals; this could provide an anatomical substrate for the descending excitation reflex. Subgroups of ascending interneurons and neurons with immunoreactivity for NOS, were also targeted by 5-HT interneurons. Thus, subtypes of these neurons might act in separate reflex pathways. Despite strong physiological evidence for 5-HT inputs to AH/Dogiel type II neurons, few contacts were identified. In Chapter 3, the confocal microscopy survey was extended to the three other interneuron classes (VIP/NOS and SOM descending interneurons; calretinin ascending interneurons) of guinea pig small intestine.

The dissertation&#8217;s central, interlocking, themes are authenticity and different worlds. Its conceptual foundation is Martin Heidegger&#8217;s account of being human. It explores the ironic possibility that innovation as it is don&#8217;t today (as integrated craft work) can encourage "authentic" human existence. The dissertation synthesises original research on innovators working in a commercial innovation consultancy with Heidegger&#8217;s thinking on authenticity, science and technology, and with contemporary innovation scholarship and social studies of science and technology. It uses a Heideggerian phenomenological method and includes two chapters written in an unusual fragmentary style to signify the momentary nature of understanding. Original aspects of the dissertation include (1) an interpretation of Heidegger&#8217;s concept of fore-structure as self-understanding in the sense of understanding ones role in how the world is understood and (2) the ironic suggestion that pressure for commercial success has transformed innovation from a scientific process to a techne process and has encouraged authenticity. I suggest the self-understanding of scientists is different from the self-understanding of innovators. I suggest innovators, at least some of the time (in their magic moments), understand themselves as "partners with Being," as modest but important witnesses to what being grants rather than as masters of the "reality" with which they work.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Heidegger, innovation, philosophy, technology</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/2386</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Masculinities in local contexts: structural, individual and cultural interdependencies</field><field name="creator">Lusher,  Dean Stewart</field><field name="description">Knowledge of the terms sex and gender has important political, health and equity considerations. This thesis investigates the macrostructural assertions of Connell&#8217;s social theory of gender which is fundamentally concerned with demonstrating the relational and hierarchical nature of gender. A major criticism of the theory has been its lack of account of the individual and the ways in which gender is performed in local settings. Therefore, investigation primarily concerns whether Connell&#8217;s macrostructural theory is explicable in local social contexts. A theoretical critique and reframing of the theory lead to articulating the interdependency between structural, cultural and individual factors. By explicitly stating Connell&#8217;s implicit assertions, what becomes evident is that people&#8217;s gendered relations are interrelated with beliefs which are held personally and shared culturally. Specifically, a major theoretical impasse is overcome when recognising that the &#8220;ideology of supremacy&#8221; of a dominative masculinity is necessarily interdependent with the structural relations of power.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">masculinity, hegemonic masculinity, social network analysis, exponential random graph (p*) models</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.infodiv.unimelb.edu.au/00002448/01/Dean_Lusher_PhD.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/214</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The colonization of time: ritual, routine and resistance in the 19th-century Cape Colony and Victoria</field><field name="creator">Nanni, Giordano</field><field name="description">By the beginning of the nineteenth century a wide cross-section of British society had strongly correlated the notions of &#8216;civilization&#8217; and &#8216;true religion&#8217; with the accurate measurement and profitable use of time.

Consequently, in the British colonies, the portrayal of indigenous societies as being &#8216;time-less&#8217; (i.e.: culturally lacking regularity, order and uniformity) came to operate as a means of constructing an inferior, &#8216;irregular other&#8217;.

H. Nasution established the Armed Forces History Centre in 1964 for the purpose of countering a communist history of the 1945-49 revolution. After the coup attempt of 1965 and the ensuing military takeover of government the History Centre assumed a far more assertive and prominent role in history making. The fact that Nugroho Notosusanto, as Head of the Centre, took over the planning of Sukarno&#8217;s half-completed National Monument History Museum project in 1969 provides evidence of the extent to which national history making became military business in the early New Order period. The study considers how history was represented in the projects of the Centre from its inception in 1964 to its last museum project in 1993. It traces how the military used history from the early years of the New Order to legitimize the overthrow of the Sukmo regime, to justify the killing of perhaps 500,000 alleged communists, to strengthen military unity and to legitimize the military&#8217;s political role and the suppression of regime dissent. Where possible this study compares military representations of the Indonesian past with earlier representations of the past, especially Sukamoist interpretations of the past made in the leftist Guided Democracy period. In doing so the thesis examines how the national myth and related constructions of national identity were transformed by the military-dominated New Order regime.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">military museums - Indonesia, Indonesia - history</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.infodiv.unimelb.edu.au/00002460/01/McGregor_full.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/355</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ecology and conservation biology of the Baw Baw frog Philoria frosti (Anura: Myobatrachidae): distribution, abundance, autoecology and demography</field><field name="creator">Hollis, Gregory  J.</field><field name="description">The decline of amphibian populations around the world is a well documented phenomenon.

Commencing with an analysis of continuing racialisation in health research, it is shown that there is no consistent evidence that oppressed ethnoracial groups, who suffer disproportionately from type 2 diabetes, are especially genetically susceptible to this disease. Continued attribution of ethnoracial differences in health to genetics highlights the need to be attentive to both environmental and genetic risk factors operating within and between ethnoracial groups. This exploration of racialisation is followed by a theoretical examination of racism as a health risk factor. This includes a comprehensive definition of racism, a diagrammaticrepresentation of the aetiological relationship between racism and health and an examination of the dimensions across which perceived racism can be operationalised.An empirical review of 138 quantitative population-based studies of self-reported racism as a determinant of health reveals that self-reported racism is related to ill-health(particularly mental health) for oppressed ethnoracial groups after adjustment for a range of confounders. This review also highlights a number of limitations in thisnascent field of research. This thesis then attempts to clarify the plethora of conceptual approaches used in thestudy of stress and health as a first step towards comprehending how stress interacts with both racism and health. A review of the empirical association between stress and chronic disease for fourth world indigenous populations and African Americans was also conducted. This review, which located 65 studies, found that a range of chronic diseases (especially chronic mental conditions) were associated with psychosocial stress. Utilising the conceptual work on operationalising racism discussed above, an instrument was developed to measure racism and its correlates as experienced by Indigenous Australians. This instrument demonstrated good face, content, psychometric andconvergent validity in a pilot study involving 312 Indigenous Australians. The majority of participants in this study (70%) reported some experience of inter-personal racism, with this exposure most commonly reported in employment and public settings, from service providers and from other Indigenous people. Strong and consistent associations were found between racism and chronic stress as well as between racism and depression (CES-D), poor/fair self-assessed health status/poor general mental health (SF-12) and a marker of CVD risk (homocysteine), respectively. There was also evidence that the association between inter-personal racism and poor mental health outcomes was ediated by somatic and inner-directed disempowered reactions to racism as well as by chronic stress and a range of psychosocial characteristics. To conclude this thesis, an examination of approaches to addressing racism forIndigenous Australians is undertaken. The theoretical issues pertinent to the study of anti-racism are discussed along with empirical findings from social psychology oneffective approaches to anti-racism. Recommendations for implementing these approaches through institutional and legal policies are also presented.

A single cylinder, high compression ratio (16.5:1), open chamber diesel engine has been converted to operate on homogenously charged compressed natural gas (CNG) with the aim of minimising pollutant emissions such as oxides of nitrogen, particulate matter and carbon dioxide.  Three ignition systems were tested to examine how effectively they could ignite lean mixtures of CNG with the ultimate aim of achieving simultaneously high thermal efficiency and low oxides of nitrogen emissions.  The ignition systems examined were spark ignition (SI), diesel pilot ignition (DPI) and hydrogen assisted jet ignition (HAJI). Irrespective of ignition system used, the efficiency of the engine operating on CNG was significantly reduced at part load compared to diesel.  This was predominantly due to a greater amount of unburnt hydrocarbons, higher cycle-by-cycle variability, slow and partial burns and increased heat transfer to the walls. DPI and HAJI systems were able to extend the lean limit to lambda 2.7 and 3.3 respectively, however this did not result in efficiency gains over SI systems. HAJI proved to be superior to DPI with higher peak efficiency, lower carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and particulates, and significantly lower oxides of nitrogen in the absence of a locally rich ignition source.

A questionnaire survey was conducted that explored general and specific issues concerning rotary NiTi instruments and techniques. An assessment of response rate and non-response bias was made by analysing responses to a question requiring a simple yes/no answer. Secondly, intraoperative defects, specifically fracture, of rotary NiTi instruments were assessed by collecting and examining over 7,000 rotary NiTi instruments used in patients by 14 endodontists from four countries and subsequently discarded. Thirdly, an assessment was made of whether rotary NiTi instruments can be predictably cleaned in the busy private practice setting.Analysis of the response rate and non-response bias in the questionnaire survey indicated the existence of differences between early and late responders despite no apparent demographic differences. Respondents to the questionnaire indicated many different reasons for adoption or non-adoption of the new technology, which could be interpreted as demonstrating behavioural differencesbetween adopters and non-adopters. Analysis of the discarded instruments indicated that the differences in technical ability between the endodontists was a more important clinical consideration in defect and fracture rates of rotary NiTi instruments than the perceived fragility of the instruments themselves. Also, a simple and effective protocol was developed for the predictable cleaning of rotary NiTi instruments. Therefore, overall, the results of the three parts of this thesis &#8211; the questionnaire survey, the instrument defects and the instrument cleaning &#8211; indicated the existence of personality and behavioural factors, which could potentially influence the adoption of new technology. The perceived technical concerns preventing adoption of the new technology were not necessarily valid, and there were other issues affecting these decisions.This thesis has shown that the diffusion of innovation in dentistry involves a complex interplay of factors. Those factors included perceived benefits and advantages, and psychosocial and behavioural factors in decision-making. This work has also highlighted the usefulness of questionnaire survey research in elucidating reasons for adoption and non-adoption of new technology. The finding of significant differences in clinical experiences between individual dentists brings into question the role of the factors of clinical competency and error in the diffusion of innovation. The importance of continuing education in dentistry has been highlighted but also that such courses must be authoritative.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.infodiv.unimelb.edu.au/00001609/01/Peter's_thesis.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/723</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Envelope protein domains of duck hepatitis B virus: role in assembly and infectivity</field><field name="creator">Chojnacki, Jakub</field><field name="description">Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a global public health problem with an estimated number of 350 million carriers world wide who are at risk of development of severe liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma.

Knowledge of the hydrology of Australia&#8217;s arid zone is poor, yet is critical in understanding the ecology of the region. The research presented in this thesis seeks to address some shortcomings in our understanding of the hydrology of the Australian arid zone. In particular, the research examines the requirements for modelling the flow regime of arid zone rivers, concentrating on the rivers of the Lake Eyre Basin (LEB). The LEB has exceptionally low annual runoff of 3.5 mm, its major rivers develop over extremely low gradients and are characterised by very wide floodplains and complex anastomosing flow paths in their mid to lower reaches. This research was driven by both a practical and theoretical impetus. Practically, hydrological data were required at the water body scale for a large number of sites across three river systems of the LEB, for use in a study, known as ARIDFLO, of the ecological responses to hydrological conditions. Because of the remoteness of these sites and the paucity of gauging stations on these rivers, modelling of the rivers was the only method for delivering the required discharge data. Theoretically, the challenge was set for creating hydrological models for some extraordinarily complex river systems, in terms of their size, catchment characteristics and flow regime variability.

It is found that no theory yet exists which can predict the form drag of a bluff body without some recourse to experimental data, even for the simple case of an isolated bluff-plate in an unsheared stream. In the present state of knowledge, and considering the complexity of turbulent shear flows, a theory for the form drag of bluff-plates immersed in turbulent boundary-layers seems remote. A correlation scheme is proposed to relate the form drag of a bluff-plate which is attached to a smooth-wall with the mean-flow characteristics of the naturally-developed, turbulent boundary-layer in which it is immersed. The investigation is limited to smooth-wall flows of the type described by Coles (1956). It is suggested that, for bluff-plates which are small compared with the boundary-layer thickness, the drag might depend only on the &#8220;wall variables&#8221;: wall shear-stress, fluid density and viscosity, and the plate height.</field><field name="date">1965</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">shear flow, drag (aerodynamics)</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.infodiv.unimelb.edu.au/00001318/01/Good.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/966</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Indelible: a movement based practice-led inquiry into memory, remembering and representation</field><field name="creator">Ellis, Simon K.</field><field name="description">Indelible is a performance and dance research project. It has three outcomes or pathways, presented on DVD-ROM, via which the user-reader can experience multi-modal perspectives on remembering, memory, and representing performative ideas, events and actions. These pathways are video, writing and interactive and together they form a series of hypermedia framings by which the corporeal and philosophical underpinnings of the project are witnessed. The research is considered to be practice-led, in which my practice consists of choreographic strategies, physical actions, media-based processes, and writing. Within these core representations I have sought to confront the methodological and theoretical paradox affecting performance makers electing to recontextualise their work beyond live processes. How might the absence or disappearance of a so-called live work contribute to the overall design and representational practices underlying the outcomes? In this sense the three pathways that comprise Indelible generate a complex network of artistic, scholarly, poetic, and methodological layerings or enfoldings in which the user-reader is presented with possibilities for experiencing the vital subjectivity and inherent fallibility of memory and remembering.

The drift of population into the urban centres after the goldrush marked the beginning of a rapid and continual urban expansion in Melbourne as the city&#8217;s industrial and commercial sectors grew and diversified. Throughout the 1870s and 1880s, the increasing population provided a larger workforce which also represented a growing consumer market. The rise of the Victorian manufacturing industries in this period also saw the introduction of the modern factory system. With the increasing demand for unskilled labour in factories, it was not only men who entered this new factory workforce. Young women and older children were, for the first time, drawn in appreciable numbers into the industrial workforce as employers keenly sought their services as unskilled and cheap workers. Women were concentrated in specific areas of the labour market, such as the clothing, boot, food and drink industries, which became strictly areas of  &#8220;women&#8217;s work&#8221;. In the early twentieth century, the rigid sexual demarcation of work was represented by gender-differentiated wages and employment provisions within industrial awards.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australian Labor Party, Victoria, Victorian branch, history, working class, women, Australia, employment, Labour Union members</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.infodiv.unimelb.edu.au/00000326/01/Raymond.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/996</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Selected problems in lattice statistical mechanics</field><field name="creator">Chan, Yao-ban</field><field name="description">This thesis consists of an introduction and four chapters, with each chapter covering a different topic.

This is based on the work of Baxter, whose CTM equations we re-derive in detail. We then propose two methods that utilise these CTM equations to derive series expansions. The first one is based on iterating through the equations sequentially. We ran this algorithm on the hard squares model and produced 48 series terms. The second method, based on the corner transfer matrix renormalization group method of Nishino and Okunishi, is much faster (though still exponential in time), but only currently works for numerical calculations.

Rather, I distinguish such hegemonic practice from the presence of ideological causality in cinema in order to emphasize the hidden, because subliminal, nature of ideology.

Treatment with chemical insecticides has been a weapon of choice, but the inevitable evolution of resistance has followed in many insect species. Resistance represents a major challenge, not only for agricultural production, but also for environmental preservation and human health. Two major options for resistance have been identified, and these are target-site based and metabolic-based resistance. Much insecticide resistance research focuses on identifying these mechanisms through genetic and molecular analysis. The insecticide lufenuron is the focus of this study. It belongs to a novel insecticidal group called the insect growth regulators, which were introduced in 1970s as highly selective insecticides with low vertebrate toxicity. Resistance to lufenuron in the non-pest species Drosophila melanogaster has been observed in field populations, despite the lack of field usage of lufenuron (Wilson &amp; Cain, 1997; O&#8217;Keefe, 1997). This study has taken advantage of this phenomenon to investigate resistance mechanisms in natural populations. At least two detoxification mechanisms were identified.

The modern era, it is often alleged, has been dominated by the sense of sight, and from its inception, photography was explicitly understood in relation to this prestigious notion of modern vision. The camera and its associated technologies offered a &#8220;new&#8221; and modern way of seeing that was central to the overall project of modernity. This thesis is a study of the role of photography in the increasing visualisation of Australian culture during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Drawing on debates around modernism, it explores the cultural and social expressions of photography. Each chapter of this thesis considers an aspect of photography or its use, and traces the emerging popularisation and commodification of the photographic image. The social impact of photography is explored in a selection of specific contexts that include early camera clubs and societies of the 1890s, and the growing amateur movement that followed the new &#8220;point and shoot&#8221; technology so ably depicted by the Kodak Girl. Other contexts include the professional applications of photography, official and private uses of photography during World War I, and finally the journalistic and cinematic uses of the photographic image in the 1920s. Together these contexts show how the romance and optimism of technology ignited enthusiasm for the visual medium across class and gender divides, moving from initial popularity amongst a local scientific elite, spreading to amateurs, professionals, and eventually being put to political and social uses, throughout the world.

In the dramatic process, the creation and the environment from which it emerges are inevitably transformed in the process of enactment. These transformations manifest in the context of power relations - in the context of the receptors ability to make decisions and to engage in actions, and the communicators ability to influence the receptors opinions and behaviour.

Despite the long history of design and developments of hole making tools, the modern twist drill, which undertakes most of the hole making tasks, is largely based on Morse&#8217;s geometrical design patented in 1863. however, considerable improvements in the technological performance of drilling operations as assessed by the forces, power, drill-life and hole quality have been achieved through the use of stronger and more wear resistant tool materials, better selection of the salient drill point features and improvements in drill manufacturing methods involving increased automation and geometrical control of drill variability. A variety of drill point modifications and designs have also been proposed and made commercially available although the modern conventional general purpose twist drill design still remains the standard product of drill manufacturers commonly available in stock. The improvement of the technological performance of twist drills has traditionally been the domain of the drill manufacturers who provide technical information and advice often in the form of machining feed and speed recommendations for use in practice. Such machining recommendations or data may also be found in special handbooks which sometimes include drilling performance data such as thrust, torque and power requirements or the expected drill-life in the form of tables, monographs or empirical equations which include the obvious process variables such as the feed and speed.

The relatively recent development of validated and reliable criteria for identifying young people at high-risk (UHR) of developing psychosis has enabled the process of onset of psychotic illnesses to be studied more closely than was previously possible.  It has also opened the way to the development and evaluation of preventive interventions.  This longitudinal study aimed to compare the experiences of stress and coping between a UHR cohort (N = 143) and a group of young people without mental health concerns (HC group, N = 32).

However the long-term results of CABG using the saphenous vein graft have not been satisfactory. Surgeons have therefore been seeking a better conduit. The radial artery (RA) is a potentially suitable alternative conduit and has to date provided good early results. This thesis investigates the utility of the RA as a coronary artery bypass graft from a number of perspectives. It demonstrates the safety of RA harvesting by examining hand collateral circulation using anatomical dissection, physical examination using the modified Allen test, measuring digital blood pressure, and examining the flow velocity in the digital artery using Doppler ultrasound. Anatomical examinations revealed consistent continuity between the RA and ulnar artery in the hand through either superficial or deep palmar arches. The modified Allen test was found to be useful as a screening test compared with the Doppler dynamic test and digital blood pressure index. A histological comparison was made between pre-existing intimal disease in the RA compared with that in the standard conduit the internal thoracic artery (ITA). The RA showed a higher prevalence and degree of intimal disease than ITA. Risk factors for intimal hyperplasia in the RA were age, diabetes, smoking and peripheral vascular disease. The only predictor for medial calcification was age.

This research investigates new ways of storing and retrieving spatial data quality information in databases. Given the importance of features and sub-feature variation, three different data quality models of spatial variation in quality have been identified and defined: per-feature, feature-independent and feature-hybrid. Quality information is stored against each feature in the per-feature model. In the feature-independent model, quality information is independent of the feature. The feature-hybrid is derived from a combination of the other two models. In general, each model of spatial variation is different in its representational and querying capabilities. However, no model is entirely superior in storing and retrieving spatially varying quality. Hence, an integrated data model called as RDBMS for Spatial Variation in Quality (RSVQ) was developed by integrating per-feature, feature-independent and feature-hybrid data quality models. The RSVQ data model provides flexible representation of SDQ, which can be stored alongside individual features or parts of features in the database, or as an independent spatial data layer.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">quality, spatial variation, metadata, sub-feature variation, per-feature, feature-independent, feature-hybrid</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/3544</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/3544</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A quantitative analysis of B cell responses to specific antigen</field><field name="creator">Turner, M. L.</field><field name="description">Humoral immune responses arise when B lymphocytes respond to activation signals, enter mitosis and proliferate rapidly. Concurrent differentiation to antibody secreting and isotype switched effector cells is tightly linked to cell division, such that the degree of proliferation strongly influences the nature of the response that is mounted. Previous versions of a quantitative model of lymphocyte proliferation based on inherent variation in the time cells take to divide or die were able to accurately describe the entry of na&#239;ve, resting cells into division and subsequent population expansion. In the work described here, the model was tested and extended by investigating the proliferation cessation and population contraction phases of in vitro B cell responses. Experiments designed to assess the distribution of times to die of cells that had ceased proliferating revealed that the number of divisions achieved by individual cells is stochastically distributed in the population and varied in response to different stimuli. Both the concentration and duration of stimulation regulate the number of divisions undergone. A cell that stops dividing is described as having reached its division destiny. Further investigation revealed that cells reach a maximum division destiny even during repeated high-dose stimulation. This limit is dictated by cellular progression through divisions, and is not dependent on the survival capacity of the cells or time. Incorporation of division destiny in the quantitative model allows proliferation cessation to be described and the distribution of times to die after this point to be assessed. This extended model can describe the full course of in vitro lymphocyte proliferative responses to various different stimuli.

It examines public memorial sites in Cambodia dedicated to the victims of the genocide of 1975 to 1979. Scant attention has been paid to the geographies of Cambodia&#8217;s post-1979 reconstruction period. Where commentators have noted the existence of Cambodia&#8217;s dedicated spaces of memory they have characterised these sites as culturally and politically inauthentic or marginal (as ersatz religious monuments, or as political &#8216;propaganda&#8217;). Against these accounts, I contend that Cambodia&#8217; s memorials are central to, and productive of, cultural, national and transnational politics of the past and present. Like many other late twentieth-century contexts, the Cambodian case demonstrates the link between the texts and practices of geopolitics and discourses of traumatic memory. The dissertation examines how various tropes of memory enact an imaginative topography of Cambodia, both locally and transnationally. I do this by analysing four memorial sites and practices: the development of the Choeung Ek &#8216;killing field&#8217; site (Phnom Penh); tourism to Cambodia&#8217;s genocide sites as a popular geopolitical practice; and the global circulation and reception of photographs of Khmer Rouge victims. It is argued that these sites and practices of memory have been central to Cambodia&#8217;s redevelopment as well as constitutive of the geopolitics of Cambodia&#8217;s e-entry into an international state system.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">genocide, Cambodia, polital atrocities, geopolitics, memory, Political aspects, Cambodian history, killing fields</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.infodiv.unimelb.edu.au/00003819/01/Hughes_R.B.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/1605</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of Customary Marine Tenure and local knowledge in fishery management at West Nggela, Solomon Islands</field><field name="creator">Foale,  Simon</field><field name="description">A proper understanding of the management of small-scale subsistence and artisanal fisheries requires not only detailed sociocultural study, but comprehensive analysis of the state of the fished population(s) using rigorous stock assessment and other fisheries biology tools.

Genes have essentially been synonymous with proteins, with RNA viewed primarily as an intermediate template for protein translation. Intriguingly, only ~2% of the human genome encodes proteins, and the number of protein-coding genes (~20,000) is similar between humans and the simple nematode worm.I have been involved with the analysis of a large-scale transcriptome study, intiated by the RIKEN Genomic Sciences Centre in Japan. As part of this work, it was discovered that the genome carries instructions for tens of thousands of &#8220;non protein-coding RNAs&#8221; (ncRNAs)(please refer to Appendix A to view the original articles that appeared in Science). The significance of these ncRNAs remains a matter of intense interest and debate. Some have argued that these ncRNAs are simply transcriptional noise, while others have suggested that they comprise a critical regulatory system, which directs the complex patterns of gene expression that underlie differentiation and development.To investigate this further, I have conducted a series of studies that explore the expression and evolution of ncRNAs in mammals. Firstly, I established a comprehensive, on-line database of ncRNAs. This collection provides information on more than twenty thousand ncRNAs, and has proven a valuable resource for ncRNA studies. Secondly, I have systematically analyzed the conservation of known functional ncRNA subsets. I found that small ncRNAs (microRNAs and snoRNAs) were well-conserved similar to protein-coding sequences, whereas longer functional ncRNAs were not. These results indicate that long ncRNAs are evolving more rapidly than other functional genomic elements, and suggest that many of the recently-discovered ncRNAs &#8211; most of which are long and of unknown significance &#8211; might still be functional, despite having poor sequence conservation. Thirdly, I have shown that many ncRNAs are derived from genuine transcripts, whose expression appears regulated in a biologically-relevant manner. Fourthly, I helped develop a computational strategy to identify extremely large ncRNAs and discovered &gt;60 novel candidates, several of which were characterized experimentally. Prior to this work, only a handful of extremely large ncRNAs had been previously described, and these play critical roles in processes such as genomic imprinting and X chromosome inactivation. This study represented the first systematic discovery of extremely large ncRNAs. Finally, I designed custom microarrays and profiled ncRNA expression across the development of CD8+ T cells. CD8+ T cells serve an important role in immunity by killing virus-infected and tumour cells, and transit through a series of functionally-distinct developmental stages. I found that ~200 novel ncRNAs are dynamically expressed during CD8+ T cell development.Taken together, my findings indicate that ncRNAs are a major, regulated output of the mammalian genome, and are consistent with the notion that ncRNAs represent an important, previously-unrecognised biological control system.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Genes, transcriptome study, mammalian genome</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.infodiv.unimelb.edu.au/00003690/01/Thesis_KP_master[1].pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/1636</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">From technical education to workplace training: emergence of the Australian National Training Package</field><field name="creator">Smith, Helen</field><field name="description">Using methods of empirical ontology this thesis tells of the emergence, over the last decade of the twentieth century, of the Australian National Training Package, and shows how this device, with agency in contemporary Australian workplaces and educational institutions, has displaced curriculum as the means through which nationally recognised vocational education and training in Australia is organised and regulated.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australian National Training Authority, curriculum based assessment in Australia, technical education, vocational education, occupational training</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.infodiv.unimelb.edu.au/00003674/01/Binder3.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/1631</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Re-disciplining generic skills: an examination of the relationship between the disciplinary context and generic skills in higher education</field><field name="creator">Jones,  Anna Louise</field><field name="description">This study investigates the relationship between generic skills or attributes and the disciplinary context.

The interviews were transcribed and analysed using the qualitative research methodology of phenomenology, based on the Giorgi (1975) model. The results of this investigation showed that their developmentally appropriate desires for fun, freedom, control and the achievement of group cohesion were essential in order for the six bereaved adolescents to successfully address the emotions of grief and share stories that strengthen continuing bonds with their loved ones who have died.

One important quantity to monitor is the optical signal-to-noise ratio (OSNR). And in high bit rate fiber optical systems operating at 10 Gb/s or beyond, compensating optical impairments becomes important. In this thesis, we investigate OSNR monitoring using beat noise and present two new OSNR monitoring techniques. We propose an OSNR monitoring technique using uncorrelated beat noise and show by experiment for a 10 Gb/s system that in the OSNR range from 10 dB to 30 dB, the proposed OSNR monitoring scheme has a measurement error of less than 0.5 dB. Then, we propose and experimentally demonstrate for the first time an OSNR monitoring technique using beat noise for optical packet switched networks which performs monitoring on a packet basis. The response time of the OSNR monitor can be around 10 ns and the OSNR measurement error is found to be less than 0.6 dB for OSNR from 10 dB to 30 dB. We also explore chromatic dispersion and polarization-mode dispersion (PMD) mitigation using Viterbi equalization in 10 Gb/s nonreturn-to-zero differential phase-shift keying (NRZ-DPSK) and differential quadrature phase-shift keying (NRZ-DQPSK) systems. We show through simulations that using Viterbi equalizers improves the performance of NRZ-OOK, NRZ-DPSK and NRZ-DQPSK receivers. For NRZ-DQPSK receiver with a Viterbi equalizer, the chromatic dispersion tolerance is about 5048 ps/nm and the PMD tolerance is about 160 ps at 3 dB OSNR penalty.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.infodiv.unimelb.edu.au/00002993/01/Thesis050307_archival.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/1713</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">One and many: a comparative study of Plato's philosophy and Daoism represented by Ge Hong</field><field name="creator">Zhang, Ji</field><field name="description">The &#8220;one-many&#8221; problem is ontological rather than logical.

Along these lines, the thesis examines the determinants of knowledge sharing between inpatriates and HQ staff as well as the resulting implications for inpatriates&#8217; careers. Integrating research on international assignments and MNC knowledge flows with social capital theory, the main argument is that inpatriates can only share their local subsidiary knowledge with and learn from HQ employees if they establish social capital with them.  The empirical investigation of inpatriates as the study&#8217;s principal unit of analysis follows a multi-method approach. First, a qualitative and inductive case study based on 13 interviews with inpatriates at three German MNCs is conducted, aiming to provide a deeper understanding of the inpatriate phenomenon. The interview findings highlight inpatriates&#8217; role as knowledge conduits and derive various factors that may impact on inpatriates&#8217; knowledge sharing, such as inpatriates&#8217; acculturation attitudes, their host language fluency, host ethnocentrism and available organizational support.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">international assignments, knowledge sharing, social capital, multinational corporations, careers, cross-cultural issues</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.infodiv.unimelb.edu.au/00003635/01/PhD_Bjoern_Sebastian_Reiche.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/1851</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Embedded: the Australian Red Cross in the Second World War</field><field name="creator">Spear, Jonathan A.</field><field name="description">This thesis demonstrates that the Australian Red Cross was embedded with the Australian government, military and civilian &#8216;home front&#8217; during the Second World War.

Assuming a public cultural role that was well out of proportion to the Parsis&#8217; extreme minority status in India, Parsi theatre soon transcended its origins in the Parsi community and became an important generic category of popular public entertainment in late-imperial South Asia. This generic categorisation has led to many conceptualisations of &#8216;Parsi theatre&#8217; which ignore the Parsi origins of Parsi theatre altogether. However, the specifically Parsi origins of Parsi theatre, in the public space which Parsis played a major part in constructing in nineteenth century Bombay, enable us, while at the same time avoiding an excessively &#8216;ethnographic&#8217; approach, to identify the originative characteristics of Parsi theatre that inform its powerful legacy in South Asian cultural history. In particular, it is the characteristic &#8216;theatricality&#8217; of Parsi theatre that enables it to act as a mediated representation of self-identity in the public space of modern South Asia.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Parsi theatre, Gujarati drama</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.infodiv.unimelb.edu.au/00003914/01/Willmer_D,C,.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/2057</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Initial capital and margins required to secure a Japanese life insurance policy portfolio under stochastic interest rates</field><field name="creator">Sato, Manabu</field><field name="description">During the last decade several Japanese life insurance companies failed mainly due to interest losses. In fact, interest rate risk dominates mortality risk for a portfolio of business in force. When the interest rates are modelled as random variables, the yields on bonds are the sum of expected short spot rates and a risk premium for random bond prices. However, in our study, we assume a risk-neutral environment, i.e. zero risk premiums. As tools to deal with stochastic interest rates, various interest rate term structure models are considered. The Vasicek model, the Heath-Jarrow-Morton (hereafter &#8220;HJM&#8221;) approach and Cairns&#8217; model are explained in detail. The history and nature of the very low interest rate environment in Japan is described in line with the monetary policy framework of the central bank. An unusual interest rate movement in the very low interest rate environment is identified. A modified HJM approach and Cairns&#8217; model are chosen in our study. Cairns&#8217; model is used to graduate the initial yield curve. The HJM approach with a specific volatility function and modified to deal with very low interest rates is used for simulating subsequent developments of the initial yield curve. After the introduction of various concepts needed to investigate a life insurance policy portfolio, we prepare for simulation by collecting information and by fitting parameters to market observations. The Yen swap curve is chosen as a base yield curve. The simulation results show how much initial capital and/or margins are needed in order to avoid the ruin of a portfolio.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">interest rate risk, interest rate term structure, Japanese life insurance, HJM model, zero interest rate, ruin probability</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.infodiv.unimelb.edu.au/00003998/01/WholeThesis.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/2075</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fair valuation of insurance liabilities - a case study</field><field name="creator">Sato, Manabu</field><field name="description">Insurance contracts will be reported at fair values on insurers&#8217; balance sheets from 2010.

The focus of the thesis is to analyze the techniques of invariants used in local search. The use of invariants have recently become the cornerstone of local search technology as they provide a declarative way to specify incremental algorithms. We have produced a series of program libraries in C++ known as the One-Way-Solver. The One-Way-Solver includes the implementation of incremental data structures and is a useful tool for the implementation of local search.

The aim of this thesis is to consolidate the different areas of previous research into one cohesive model of assault offenders and offences. This model will consider the developmental, cognitive, behavioural and environmental constituents of assault offenders and offences in a temporal framework. Interviews were conducted with 35 male and 13 female offenders who had a conviction for assault. Grounded Theory analysis was used to categorise the data and construct a model of assault including developmental factors, the time preceding the offence, the offence and the time after the offence producing the Pathways Model of Assault (PMA). Initial construction of the PMA was conducted using 25 of the male participant interview transcripts. The PMA was then validated across gender through inclusion of the 13 female participant transcripts. The PMA was also subject to an inter-rater reliability test, which provided high consistency between the coding of two researchers using the final 10 male participant transcripts and 10 randomly chosen female participant transcripts. The PMA consisted of 10 stages where the individual differences of the participants could be mapped, thus providing &#8220;pathways&#8221; through the model. Five major pathways were found. Further exploration of the PMA through quantitative analyses provided validation of four of the pathways, with significant associations found between two of the offender types and two of the offence types. The offender types reported were under-controlled, representing persistent repeat violent offenders and over-controlled, representing onetime violent offenders.

Further, existing brokering systems rely on centralised information services for resource discovery. Centralised or hierarchical resource discovery systems are prone to single-point failure, lack scalability and fault-tolerance ability. In the centralised model, the network links leading to the server are very critical to the overall functionality of the system, as their failure might halt the entire distributed system operation.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">grid computing, federated grids, peer-to-peer, resource discovery</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.infodiv.unimelb.edu.au/00004065/01/RajivPhDThesis.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/2290</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sustainable energy in Australia: an analysis of performance and drivers relative to other OECD countries</field><field name="creator">Kinrade, P.

In fact, Kendall makes very little reference to the veterinary college that he founded, his teaching or the trials that he was to confront, but out of that chance encounter with his notebooks I became interested in the early years of the profession in Victoria; the profession to which Kendall devoted so much of his incredible energy and enthusiasm.  Further inquiry only served to enhance this interest, but revealed that there was a paucity not only of primary source material, but also of recorded history.  During the course of conversations with both retired and active practitioners, I have frequently been told, and can verify, that veterinarians are great talkers, and many of them are keen to preserve their historical heritage, but are the worst procrastinators when it comes to the written word.

At the time it was first encountered by Europeans, in 1803, the land around Port Phillip Bay supported a wide diversity of ecosystems. For millennia the area was the territory of Aboriginal clans belonging to two language groups, Woi wurrung and Boon wurrung.  These peoples lived in spiritual union with the land, exploiting its abundant resources, and, through a range of practices, maintaining it in the form in which it had been created. The encroachment of Europeans onto clan estates, beginning in the 1830s, brought dramatic changes to this Aboriginal way of life, and also to the local landscapes themselves.   The thesis propounded here is that the natural history of the area was a major influence on the occupation and use of the area by humans, and that to understand the particulars of that natural history is to have an insight into the human history. The bulk of the study is therefore a reconstruction of that natural history, which is offered as the physical context of human action in the area.

The task of restoring the functions of riparian zones is an enormous one and requires spatial and temporal prioritisation.  An analysis of the existing and historical functions of riparian zones and their spatial distribution is a major aid to this process and will enable efficient use of remediation resources.

This thesis includes three parts and makes contributions in three research areas in optical fiber networks, by applying optical and electronic signal processing techniques. In the first part of the thesis, optical signal processing is employed to realize a novel all-optical label swapping (AOLS) technique using synchronous phase modulation. This technique is shown to address the forwarding speed bottleneck in optical packet switched networks (OPSN). By exploiting the unique symmetry of phase-shift keying (PSK), for the first time, label erasure and insertion are performed in a single step by a phase modulator without wavelength conversion. We also propose and demonstrate a polarization insensitive phase modulator to address the polarization sensitivity of AOLS. Furthermore, we emulate multi-hop all-optical label swapping in a re-circulating loop to investigate the power penalties from the accumulated phase errors and the timing mismatch. Based on the experimental and analytical results, we show that this technique can save wavelength converters significantly if compared with conventional AOLS techniques requiring dedicate wavelength converters.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">optical fiber communication, signal processing</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/2383</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/2383</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Moving images, the museum &amp; a politics of movement: a study of the museum visitor</field><field name="creator">Radywyl, Natalia</field><field name="description">This dissertation is an investigation of visitor experiences in the Screen Gallery at the Australian Centre for the Moving Image (ACMI), in Melbourne.

Whilst there is much anecdotal information on the impact of DNA profiling on criminal investigation, prosecution and adjudication, there is little quantitative and control comparison data on the routine use of forensic DNA profiling.  This study evaluates the effect of the introduction of DNA profiling in Victoria on a number of key points in the criminal justice system.  The overall impact of DNA profiling was low as determined by the percentage of criminal cases which utilise DNA profiling.  However, in certain classes of cases its impact was measurable, most notably in sex offences committed by &#8220;strangers&#8221;.  Less than one quarter of sexual offence cases of DNA profiled resulted in a contested trial, suggesting that the focus of DNA profiling on the criminal justice system should swing to the pre-trial phase.  DNA profiling was most often used in sexual offence cases and a database comparison of these cases before and after the advent of DNA profiling was examined.  Whilst not statistically significant, trends indicated there were more solved cases, more guilty pleas and fewer trials after the introduction of DNA profiling, but more individuals were drawn into the investigatory process.  The number of trials of sexual offences in which consent was an issue was slightly greater than previously.  The increase in guilty pleas with DNA profiling was only for stranger type crime.

It is about imperialism, nationalism and the quality of goodness told through the lens of primary school students in 1930&#8217;s and 1950&#8217;s Victoria. I begin by exploring in Chapter One how the joint change in psychology and politics forced profound change to the basic framework of primary school curriculum. Children&#8217;s relationship to information was reconceived, and so too were the curricular structures necessary for this new epistemology.  Spatial and temporal relations between Australia, Britain and the world were thus destabilized. But we need a much finer lens, and a more subtle understanding of the mechanisms of imaginative national belonging, if we are to describe this changing relationship. I take up this question in Chapter Two by looking at the reading resources given to children, from which they learnt complex lessons about aspects of being Australian. In Chapter Three I examine the impact of nationalism &#8211; Imperial and nation-state &#8211; in defining the child&#8217;s responsibilities.

Consequently this thesis aims, by a critical survey and analysis of Dalcroze&#8217;s writings, to provide an insight into the meanings and objectives of Dalcroze Eurhythmics. In addition, this investigation will seek to reveal that Dalcroze&#8217;s teaching received direction both from a multitude of influences and his extraordinary pre-occupation with rhythm.  As a music teacher, Dalcroze had endeavoured to heighten the rhythmic sensitivity of his pupils by the use of kinesthetic exercises.  As an humanitarian, Dalcroze&#8217;s research into rhythmic manifestations led him to propose rhythm as a dominating force effecting the future welfare of humankind.  An understanding of this theory, despite its grandiose tone, is especially relevant to achieving a fuller comprehension of Dalcroze&#8217;s musical studies.</field><field name="date">1984</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Emile Jaques-Dalcroze, eurythmy, Dalcroze eurhythmics, rhythm</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.infodiv.unimelb.edu.au/00002107/01/GiddensMJ.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/531</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Role of the SPRY domain in the SPRY domain-containing SOCS box proteins</field><field name="creator">Masters, Seth L.</field><field name="description">There are four mammalian SSB proteins (SSB-1 to -4), and these are characterized by a C-terminal SOCS box and central SPRY domain. The C-terminal SOCS box was first observed in proteins that were found to act as Suppressors of Cytokine Signalling and function by virtue of their SH2 domain. Other families containing the SOCS box motif were defined by the domains N-terminal to this, such as the ASBs (Ankyrin repeats), WSBs (WD40 repeats) and of course the SSBs (SPRY domains). This thesis describes a very broad investigation of the SSBs, a protein family about which very little was known. To begin with, functional investigation into the evolution of this family and analysis of murine SSB expression patterns was performed. This highlighted that the family was highly conserved and had differential expression in the mouse, suggestive of important, unique functional roles for the individual family members. The majority of work in the thesis then proceeds in three directions; (i) analysis of the SSB proteins in vivo, with genetic deletion of SSB-2 in the mouse, (ii) biochemically, with analysis of SSB binding partners, and (iii) structurally, with functional analysis of the structure of SSB-2.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">SSB-2, SPRY, structure, knockout mouse, Par-4.</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.infodiv.unimelb.edu.au/00001571/01/Thesis.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/507</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evolutionary significance of polydomy in the meat ant Iridomyrmex purpureus</field><field name="creator">van Wilgenburg, Ellen</field><field name="description">My thesis examines the evolutionary significance of polydomy using the ant Iridomyrmex purpureus as a model species.

The nature of interactions among ants from different nests of a polydomous colony varies from totally cooperative to indifference, and often the different nests within a colony may have some kind of separate identity. Polydomy is fairly common among ants, and while it has attracted some theoretical attention, there have been few empirical studies.

To many children in isolated, pioneering districts of Victoria, the secular Reader was the principal source of information and ideas. The more advanced of the Irish and British Readers contained a huge variety of factual knowledge in combination with extracts from the best of English literature. Although these imported Readers underwent exclusions, adaptations and revisions, the content remained essentially foreign to colonial Australia, with a pervading moral stance originating in the high-minded intellectual and cultural traditions of Europe. Throughout the nineteenth century, there was undue emphasis on the mechanical aspects of grammar in the elementary school curriculum. In the minds of Victorian educators, the study of grammar was firmly linked with the cultivation of high ideals and an intellectual understanding of life. In reality, the grammar books were sensible and straightforward, but badly used by the poorly-educated teachers. The popularity and cheapness of the Irish and British grammar books prevented the adoption of a number of locally-produced texts. This thesis examines the changing content and use of school books during three distinct periods: the Irish monopoly, 1848-1877, the British phase, 1877-1896 and a National phase, 1896-1948. During the first phases, there were impressive local text-book publications, reflecting a desire for more local, relevant knowledge for Australian school children and a developing independence from the Home country. Most failed to secure official patronage and had limited circulation. The more successful ones attempted to meet the needs of new curriculum programmes, emphasising local knowledge relevant to colonial children.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australian education, history of textbooks in Victoria, history of primary education in Victoria</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.infodiv.unimelb.edu.au/00001321/01/Gibbs.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/968</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Probability and paternity: the utility of probability theory in the legal determination of facts in issue with particular reference to the resolution of paternity disputes</field><field name="creator">Park,  M.

Drawing on a wide body of evidence on an under-researched topic, the thesis is arranged in two parts. The first presents a survey of how traditional images of national identity have been created, sustained and more recently challenged during the histories of Australia and New Zealand - illustrating that the question of non-indigenous national identity is a problematic one. It then provides a historical narrative of museums in both countries. Highlighting the differences and similarities between the two countries and focusing on the development of historical collections, it explores how museums have perpetuated traditional interpretations of nation, and how in recent decades various factors have combined to challenge conventional museum practice, making the role and function of museums at the beginning of the twenty-first century particularly complex. The second part focuses on the new National Museum of Australia in Canberra and the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa in Wellington. It combines an examination of their history with an analysis of how they attempt to convey ideas of nation and national identity. Both museums have opened recently, at a time when national museums around the world are confronted with an increasingly prominent and challenging political and social role in society, and an especially difficult, perhaps impossible, task of representing all the different histories that constitute the &#8216;nation&#8217;.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">National Museum of Australia, Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa, museums in Australia, museums in New Zealand, identity (psychology)in Australia and New Zealand</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.infodiv.unimelb.edu.au/00000320/01/Gore.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/992</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A curriculum design framework for science education based on the history of science</field><field name="creator">McColl, Paul V.</field><field name="description">Over many decades, much has been written about the use of the history of science in science education, particularly at the secondary school level. Course descriptions published by various education authorities have often included reference to the history of science, although student texts and formal assessment tools have not adequately developed or emphasised that area of study in a way which reflects its significance and potential value. These factors, combined with many teachers&#8217;; lack of background in the area, have meant that what happens in many classrooms does not reflect the loftier sentiments expressed in the guiding principles of the course outlines. &#8220;Scientific Literacy&#8221; has been used as a general theme for science education during the second half of the twentieth century, and particularly since the early 1980s. There has been much debate about the meaning of the concept but some common features have emerged. Among these are the need for students to gain an understanding of the nature of science and to have some appreciation of the history of science.

This image views nursing as a female occupation with nurses having little power over their practice. Researchers claim that the stereotypical public image of nursing could constrain nursing practice. For instance, nursing skills may be under- utilised and the health care environment may not adequately reward nurses for their performance. There has also been a concern that the constraints arising from the stereotypical public image of nursing may adversely affect nurses&#8217; work behaviour. Based on the Person-Environment-Occupation Model of Occupational Performance, the thesis examined how the public image of nurses could impact on nursing practice. The thesis also explored the person-environment (mis)fit in nursing, which is characterised as (in)congruence between nurses&#8217; professional orientation (i.e., nurses&#8217; self-image, role expectations and work values) and their actual practice (i.e., nurses&#8217; perception of the image of nurses held by the public, and nurses&#8217; perceptions of their actual roles and the rewards available to them in practice). In addition, the thesis investigated the factors that could moderate nurses&#8217; perception of the person-environment fit, and how this fit could impact on their job performance and turnover intention.

Agrippan constructions in the West (Gaul and the Iberian Peninsula) are described in detail, and the others are described in more general terms.

Also, constructions in towns with material remains or inscriptions have been extensively studied, but important works outside towns with fewer remains have been largely overlooked. Consequently, previous writers have represented Agrippa as a builder of monuments in towns and there has been little understanding of the nature or purpose of the totality of his works, and no proper account of them.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa, 63 B.C.?-12 B.C., Roman architecture, Roman roads, Roman antiquities, Roman colonies</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.infodiv.unimelb.edu.au/00000275/01/Mottershead__THESIS_Vol_1_2005.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/1039</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Factors that impact on principal-class leadership aspirations</field><field name="creator">Lacey,  Kathryn Anne</field><field name="description">This research investigated the factors that impact on the career decisions of teachers in government primary and secondary schools in the state of Victoria, Australia.

Securing the supply of wheat is a problem because it is susceptible to many biotic and abiotic factors that limit production.  One such factor, sprouting of the grain in the head, because of untimely rainfall prior to harvest, is a substantial problem worldwide.  Pre-harvest sprouting has a significant impact on wheat growers, who suffer considerable economic hardship as a result of yield loss during harvesting and subsequent downgrading of their sprouted crops.  Wheat processors are also affected by this problem, because sprouted grain has significantly altered chemical properties, making it unsuitable for its intended purpose, and often rendering it suitable for animal consumption only.  This study investigated mechanisms of dormancy, in the diploid wheat Triticum tauschii (Coss.) Schmalh., to assess their suitability for use in hexaploid (bread) wheat to prevent pre-harvest sprouting. A soluble germination inhibitor was found in the bracts (palea, lemma and glumes) surrounding the grain of T. tauschii.  Fractionation of an aqueous extract from the bracts, by HPLC, identified vanillic acid as being likely to be involved in this inhibition.  Further analysis of the extract also identified a strong anti-oxidant capacity, indicating that part of the inhibition of germination may arise from the prevention of oxygen reaching the embryo.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">pre-harvest sprouting, wheat</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.infodiv.unimelb.edu.au/00000825/01/KT_Gatford_PhD_Thesis_2004.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/1109</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The portrayal of gender in the Children's Book Council of Australia honour and award books, 1981-1993</field><field name="creator">Godinho,  Sally C.</field><field name="description">This study examines the portrayal of gender in Australian Children&#8217;s Book Council award and honour books in the Younger Reader and Older Reader categories over the years 1981-1993.

This research focuses on the development of a coordinated approach to the design of administrative boundaries that endeavours to support accurate decision making. Around the world, administrative boundaries have been structured in an uncoordinated manner, limiting data exchange and integration between organisations. The solution proposed in this research adopts the hierarchical reorganisation of administrative boundaries to enhance data integration and data exchange within the spatial data infrastructure (SDI) framework.The SDI is an initiative intended to facilitate access to complete and consistent data sets. One of the most fundamental problems restricting the objectives of the SDI is the fragmentation of data between non-coterminous boundary systems. The majority of administrative boundaries have been constructed by individual agencies to meet individual needs. Examples of the proliferation of different boundary systems include postcodes, census-collector districts, health districts and police districts. Due to the lack of coordination between boundary systems, current technologies for analysing spatial data, such as geographic information systems (GIS), are not reaching their full potential. A review of the current literature reveals that, until now, little has been done to solve this problem.The prototype developed within this research provides a new mechanism for the design of administrative boundaries. The prototype incorporates two algorithms. These are based on HSR theory and administrative-agency constraints and are implemented within the GIS environment. Such an approach is an example of the potential that is available when we link spatial information theory with the SDI framework and disciplinary knowledge.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">spatial data infrastructure, SDI, HSR, GIS, boundary</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.infodiv.unimelb.edu.au/00001046/01/Serryn Phd.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/1155</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The comparability of direct and semi-direct speaking tests: a case study</field><field name="creator">O'Loughlin, Kieran John</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates the equivalence of direct (live) and semi-direct (tape-mediated) versions of a test of oral proficiency which forms part of the access: test, a four-skill English language test for prospective skilled migrants to Australia sponsored by the Commonwealth Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs.

Current innovation diffusion theory, and emerging GIS and IS implementation theory are used to develop a framework for the implementation of either a new GIS, or for improving a currently ineffective GIS. The thesis describes a method of practically redefining GIS in the Local Government environment and then applying diffusion principles during the implementation of GIS. The first area of new investigation in the thesis is the approach to defining the GIS requirements of Local Government. In this thesis, GIS in Local Government is defined by starting with the business requirements and then letting them define the high level technical and functional requirements. This obtains a different answer from the traditional approach of assuming that current generic high level technical and functional definitions of GIS are correct, and that implementation is a selection and fine tuning process. The new approach is based mainly on the &#8220;productional perspective&#8221;; developed in recent theoretical GIS diffusion studies. The major difference is that GIS implementation in Local Government does not necessarily include the requirement for the design and construction of a specific GIS database. The GIS simply consists of graphical maps that spatially index and read existing non spatial databases within the Local Government IS environment.

Other major forms of social cleavage together with the ideologies which contribute to and support them, such as those which relate to class and gender, have had a complex relationship with racism. Nevertheless racism needs to be distinguished analytically from each of these, and given its due as a relatively autonomous system. Viewed from the perspective of the systematic patterning of social life, it has institutional backing and support. In the modern West especially, it has organised, and it continues to help organise, significant areas of social domain. It has a history, which includes the history of ideas and of representations of the Other, and it is closely tied to economic production and relations. Though it may be that racism is generated primarily at the social and economic levels, it is experienced psychologically, and psychology plays a role in its reproduction. Racism, then, needs to be examined not only in terms of its social structural features, but at the same time in terms of the involvement of subjectivity in its processes.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">racism, ideology</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.infodiv.unimelb.edu.au/00001238/01/Moran_Masters_Thesis.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/1386</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reasoning, critical thinking and the critical person: towards a dialogical theory of critical thinking</field><field name="creator">Glaser,  Jennifer</field><field name="description">The dialogical theory of critical thinking I develop in this thesis portrays critical thinking fundamentally as a social practice. Yet in saying this I am not suggesting that critical thinking is a form of practical reason - to be contrasted with some notion of theoretical or pure reason - rather, I shall be seeking to do away with the dichotomy. In this sense the thesis falls within the domain of the postmodern, reflecting a general reappraisal of the relationship between mind and body, thinking and experience, individual and community. One of the central issues I seek to address is the way in which critical thinking is connected to personal identity on the one hand and to general principles and constraints on the other. These constraints will be both epistemic and moral. In characterizing critical thinking as a form of human activity, I suggest that critical thinking needs to be grounded not only in a theory of epistemology, but in a theory of persons. In characterizing critical thinking as a reflexive activity - involving reflection and deliberation - I suggest that we also need to ground it in a theory of self. In suggesting that persons and selves have uniqueness or autonomy, I suggest that a dialogical conception of critical thinking needs to accommodate plurality. Finally, in seeing critical thinking as a value, and not merely as a utility, I come to characterize critical thinking in terms of virtues.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">critical thinking</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.infodiv.unimelb.edu.au/00000379/01/Glaser.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/1158</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Facilitating the use of cadastral data through the World Wide Web</field><field name="creator">Polley, Iestyn</field><field name="description">Over recent years the cadastral industry has become increasingly reliant on digital data.

In this environment it will be ideal to capitalise on computer networking technology such as the present day Internet and World Wide Web (WWW) to better facilitate the transmission of digital data. This work provides a study of the current climate in the cadastral industry and further identifies how the Internet and its related technologies can be used to facilitate the transmission of digital cadastral data. The focus is to provide a prototype application that facilitates these data transactions in the most effective manner that benefits both user and data provider. This involves a study of the different underlying Internet technologies and how they can be used within the cadastral context. The work presents how the Internet and the WWW can bring benefits in the form of increased data distribution, and, in data integration and update for data maintainers, who need efficient ways of passing digital data to and from different locations.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cadastral data, World Wide Web</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.infodiv.unimelb.edu.au/00001054/01/IestynThesisV3-0.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/1192</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Concentrations of insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) and insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) in the plasma and milk of pasture-fed dairy cows in early lactation</field><field name="creator">Obese,  Frederick Yeboah</field><field name="description">The involvement of IGFs and IGFBPs in mediating the effects of nutrition on the reproductive system in pasture-fed dairy cows and the requirement to improve assays for the determination of IGFs and IGFBPs in biological samples provided the stimulus for this thesis.

Most historians have argued that the press was reluctant to publicise the mass murder of Europe&#8217;s Jews in 1942, and they contend that this subject was also neglected in the last two years of the war.  But their claims have not been substantiated by a systematic press survey.  This thesis provides a systematic analysis of the British press&#8217;s response to the Holocaust in 1944 and 1945.   There were three crucial developments relating to the extermination of European Jewry in 1944 and 1945.  With the German occupation of Hungary in March 1944 its Jewish population of approximately 800,000 faced extermination. Between May and July of the same year almost 400,000 Hungarian Jews were deported to Poland where, at Auschwitz-Birkenau, most were exterminated. In April and May 1945 Allied forces began to uncover concentration camps in Germany into which many Jews (including many thousands from Hungary) had entered after being expelled from Polish extermination camps such as Auschwitz.  As the German concentration camps were liberated, many Jews were found among the freed inmates.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Jewish Holocaust, 1939-1945, English newspapers, 1844 - 1945, Jewish tragedy</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.infodiv.unimelb.edu.au/00000552/02/Mastfinaliv.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/1394</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Public transport policy and land use in Melbourne and Toronto, 1950 to 1990</field><field name="creator">Mees,  Paul Andrew</field><field name="description">This study examines the reasons behind the decline in public transport patronage in Melbourne between 1950 and 1990, through a comparison with Toronto. The share of urban travel undertaken by public transport has declined since the Second World War in all developed countries, but public transport patronage in Melbourne appears to have declined more rapidly than in most other industrialised cities. Public transport has, however, gained or held ground in Toronto, where the form of development is similar in many ways to Melbourne. Most accounts of Toronto&#8217;s success (particularly in Australia) regard transport/land-use integration as the critical factor. The contrasting analysis maintains that Melbourne&#8217;s urban form has changed over this period to a dispersed, car-oriented pattern. This study evaluates a different interpretation of the &#8216;Toronto model&#8217;. This is that Toronto has undergone similar urban changes to Melbourne since the war, but has found a way of operating public transport successfully in a relatively dispersed environment. The contrast with Melbourne, then, is not primarily in land-use patterns, but in policies towards the operation of public transport.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">local transit in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, local tansit in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, urban land use in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, urban land use in Toronto, Ontario,  Canada</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.infodiv.unimelb.edu.au/00000155/01/Mees.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/1411</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A critical edition and exploration of Percy Grainger's The warriors - music to an imaginary ballet</field><field name="creator">Servadei,  Alessandro</field><field name="description">Commissioned by Sir Thomas Beecham for the Ballets Russes, during their London season, but ultimately completed and premiered in the United States, The Warriors - Music to an Imaginary Ballet is Grainger&#8217;s most ambitious and experimental orchestral composition.

The concessions and omissions needed for such a drastic alteration were not true to the composer&#8217;s ideas. Along with a comprehensive historical introduction to the work, the notion of the compressed score is placed into the context of Grainger&#8217;s own scoring methods, as well as the greater context of avant-garde score layout in the twentieth century.

To the very limited that a &#8220;mainstream&#8221; literature on Lenin sought to locate him within the Marxist tradition that tradition was identified with a determinist interpretation of Marx developed by the revisionists and centrists. This approach has been countered by a generally sympathetic view of Lenin&#8217;s comments on party organisation, argued by a recent set of &#8220;critics&#8221; of the &#8220;mainstream&#8221; view. Yet despite their wish to make a comprehensive critique of the &#8220;mainstream&#8221;, most of the critics have failed to do so due a residual element of determinism in their understanding of the relation between workers&#8217; struggle and the development of class consciousness.This thesis seeks to complete the critique of the &#8220;mainstream&#8221; through establishing the role of conscious intervention in realising the material possibilities for workers&#8217; struggle. It does so through a case study of the labour movement in St. Petersburg between the &#8220;Emancipation&#8221; of 1861 and the &#8220;Stolypin Coup&#8221; of 3/6/1907. A pivotal point in the development of this movement was &#8220;Bloody Sunday&#8221; (9/1/1905), and the thesis is structured around that moment to show what changes, as well as what does not change, in the role of conscious intervention in periods of mass struggle relative to times of more limited protest.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Lenin, Marx, Marxism, St. Petersburg, class consciousness, activisim, Russia</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.infodiv.unimelb.edu.au/00000223/01/Freeman.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/1487</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The fate of cyanide in groundwater at gasworks sites in south-eastern Australia</field><field name="creator">Meehan,  Samantha</field><field name="description">The fate and transport of cyanide in groundwater was investigated at gasworks sites in southeastern Australia.

The field work was aimed at observing the behaviour of cyanide in highly contaminated groundwater environments. Measured field parameters and laboratory analytical results from groundwater sampling were used to describe the hydrodynamics and hydrochemistry of the groundwater environment, providing a framework for groundwater flow and solute transport modelling. Groundwater and soil samples were also collected for use in laboratory experiments. The results from both field sites indicate contrasting hydrogeological environments, however, inorganic (metallic and non-metallic) and organic contaminants were measured in solution at both sites. The maximum concentrations observed at both sites were up to 5,300 mg/L CN(Total) (Adelaide site) and 21 mg/L CN(Total) (Tasmanian site).

Its purpose was the promotion of a solution to Australia&#8217;s limited natural population growth in the face of defence fears and of an Australian society which, using the voices of its politicians, was increasingly willing to depict itself as an isolated and threatened British outpost. The fears themselves revolved as much around the defence of a singularly British heritage in terms of political, social and economic institutions, as a purely geographical or military threat. While the &#8220;threat&#8221; was more often perceived as assuming an Asian or non-European identity, Australians also had a history of feeling socially insecure when confronted by &#8220;non-British groups&#8221; within their own shores; the extent of that insecurity varying according to more specific ethnic categorisations within the general &#8220;non-British&#8221; label (i.e. northern c.f. southern Europeans, western c.f. eastern Europeans).  The significance of the post-war period is that within two years of the formation of an Immigration bureaucracy by a party which had traditionally been hostile to immigration, an immigration programme had also begun to be formulated which would eventually allow, encourage, and financially assist, the introduction of groups which, traditionally, were depicted as posing the very threat to Australian homogeneity which immigration had been posited as assuaging.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bonegilla, immigration, Australia, 1947-1971, migrant, training centre, Department of Immigration</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.infodiv.unimelb.edu.au/00000645/01/Sluga.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/1508</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Managed DC power reticulation systems</field><field name="creator">Morton,  Anthony Bruce</field><field name="description">Electric power engineering, as it applies to low-voltage power reticulation in buildings and industrial sites, is ripe for a &#8216;paradigm shift&#8217; to bring it properly into the Electronic Age.

The first component explores the probabilistic interpretation of Stein&#8217;s method, as introduced in Barbour (1988). This is done in the setting of random variable approximations. This probabilistic method, where the Stein equation is interpreted in terms of the generator of an underlying birth and death process having equilibrium distribution equal to that of the approximant, provides a natural explanation of why Stein&#8217;s method works. An open problem has been to use this generator approach to obtain bounds on the differences of the solution to the Stein equation. Uniform bounds on these differences produce Stein &#8220;magic&#8221; factors, which control the bounds. With the choice of unit per capita death rate for the birth and death process, we are able to produce a result giving a new Stein factor bound, which applies to a selection of distributions. The proof is via a probabilistic approach, and we also include a probabilistic proof of a Stein factor bound from Barbour, Holst and Janson (1992). These results generalise the work of Xia (1999), which applies to the Poisson distribution with unit per capita death rate.

The participants of the study are three Year Six classes and their teachers in a public primary school in Japan. Educational drama is introduced as an alternative teaching and learning method to these participants who have had no experience of drama in education.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">educational drama, primary education, Japanese education, English language as a foreign language, action research</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.infodiv.unimelb.edu.au/00003794/01/Araki-Metcalfe_Naoko's_PhD_thesis.FINAL.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/1595</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A promethean legacy: late quaternary vegetation history of Southern Georgia, Caucasus</field><field name="creator">Connor, Simon Edward</field><field name="description">This dissertation presents new data on the vegetation history of the Caucasus, a region of high biodiversity and ancient human occupation. The aim of the study is to determine the causes of vegetation changes in Southern Georgia over the past 14,000 years by comparing well-dated pollen and charcoal records to evidence of past climatic change and human activity in the region. Pollen data from semi-arid and mountainous environments are often very difficult to interpret, a consideration which has hampered previous research in Southern Georgia. In this thesis I present a novel method to overcome this problem to allow the reconstruction of past trends in rainfall, temperature, forest cover and land-use. Reconstructed climatic parameters show that the study area&#8217;s climate was extremely arid and seasonally variable between 14,000 and 11,500 years ago. Precipitation increased slowly during the early Holocene, such that a rainfall pattern of more or less modern character was established in Georgia between 9000 and 8000 years ago. Conditions then became wetter and warmer during the mid Holocene, reverting to a cooler and drier climates during the late Holocene.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/2369</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/2369</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Performance evaluation and enhancement of mobile and sensor networks</field><field name="creator">Halgamuge,  Malka Nishanthi</field><field name="description">This thesis addresses the performance evaluation and enhancement of wireless networks.

This thesis argues that an agent architecture, one designed as a sophisticated representation of an individual user, should be embedded deep in the device system software, with at least equal status to the GUI &#8211; the graphical user interface. A sophisticated model of the user is then built, drawing upon contemporary Analytical Psychology &#8211; the Psychology of Subselves. The Shadowboard Agent architecture is then built upon that user model, drawing both structural and computational implications from the underlying psychology. An XML DTD file named Shadowboard.dtd is declared as a practical manifestation of the semantics of Shadowboard. An implementation of the Shadowboard system is mapped out, via a planned conversion of two existing integrated systems: SlimWinX, an event-driven GUI system; and XSpaces, an object-oriented tuplespace system with Blackboard-like features. The decision making mechanism passes logic terms and contraints between the various sub-agent components (some of which take on the role of Constraint Solvers), giving this agent system some characteristics of a Generalised Constraint Solver. A Shadowboard agent (built using the system) consists of a central controlling autonomous agent named the Aware Ego Agent, and any number of sub-agents, which collectively form an integrated but singular whole agent modelled on the user called the Digital Self. One such whole-agent is defined in a file named DigitalSelf.xml &#8211; which conforms to the schema in Shadowboard.dtd - which offers a comprehensive and generic representation of a user&#8217;s stance in a 24x7 network, in particular - the Internet. Numerous types of Shadowboard sub-agents are declared.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">agent oriented architecture, agent oriented paradigm, Shadowboard Agent architecture, multi-agent system (mas), psychology of subselves, agent oriented software engineering, 24/7 user proxy, digital self, digital friend, human centred computing, personal assistant agent, generalised constraint solver</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.infodiv.unimelb.edu.au/00002960/01/ShadowboardThesis2001.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/1694</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Yours faithfully; Werther for the English language stage</field><field name="creator">Starrs,  David Bruno</field><field name="description">Although numerous English literary translations of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe&#8217;s &#8216;nobility in suicide&#8217; - themed, epistolary, psychological and therefore &#8220;untheatrical&#8221; (Atkins 1949) novel Die Leiden des jungen Werthers (1774) have been published &#8211; none of the resultant English stage translations have ever been described as faithful to the original. The various obstacles to the creation of a faithful translation for the English language stage were analysed. The first obstacle is caution by Christian playwrights regarding the proscribed theme of nobility in suicide. Related to this is the second obstacle; the fear of producing &#8216;imitative&#8217; suicides, which have been labelled &#8216;The Werther Effect&#8217; by sociologists (Phillips 1974). Other obstacles are form-related rather than theme-related and include the absence of an authoritative English literary translation and the difficulties in translating to the stage the psychological and epistolary novel. With reference to Goethe&#8217;s three&#8211;tiered model of translation (translated by Lefevere 1977) and cinema academic Geoffrey Wagner&#8217;s &#8216;Three modes of adaptation&#8217; (Wagner 1975) this writer has attempted to write a &#8216;prosaic&#8217;, &#8216;transpositional&#8217; and unaugmented stage translation by identifying and addressing each of the obstacles, the hypothesis being that if these obstacles were systematically addressed and overcome, then an English language stageplay closely equivalent in meaning to the prominent ideas, themes and form of the novel &#8211; that is, a work arguably faithful to the novel &#8211; could be created.

Occasionally, as those cities grow through processes of densification and agglomeration, some of the indigenous settlement (kampung) areas are put at risk of disappearing under corporate sector investments. However to some extent there is an indication that the kampung dwellers, the corporate-sector developers and those who are involved in the wider activities of the corporate sector, have an economic and social symbiotic relationship. The aim of this research is to identify the processes of change in a low-income inner city neighbourhood&#8217;s community system, in an area that is being encroached upon by modern business activities and other aspect of modernity, to explore shifts between conventionally understood roles of the kampungs, and to speculate on present theory in throwing light on processes of change which might be able to lead to new paths for urban development. The research approach is to work through the relevant literature, and then to move on to a case study approach in an Indonesian city, through which it will be possible to reflect back on the efficacy of prevailing theory.

Constructions of &#8216;Balinese culture&#8217; have been explored and identified as central projects within the island&#8217;s internal contestation of dominance as well as within the establishment of colonial and postcolonial orders. Despite this scholarly exploration of the discursive nature of &#8216;authentic Balinese culture&#8217;, public obsession with a traditional Balinese architecture, conceived as an apolitical, exotic, and pre-existing architectural other, prevails. Architecture has been and continues to be an arena within which the notion of authentic Bali is convincingly authorised by its diverse proponents: the Dutch colonial government, the orientalist scholars, the travellers, the architects, and the local elites.This thesis explores the role of architectural discourses within the construction of identity in 20th century Bali. It investigates the way writings on Bali&#8217;s architecture and contemporary formations of domestic architecture on the island are implicated by the political imagining of an &#8216;authentic Balinese&#8217; cultural identity. Invoking the architecture of Balinisation, this thesis argues that writings and domestic architectural realms are productive fields in which and by which identity and power relations are continuously formulated by those who observe Bali and by the observed &#8216;Balinese&#8217; people.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">architectural discourses, identity politics and formations, 20th century Bali, contemporary rural domestic architecture, literature on Balinese architecture, tourist gaze</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.infodiv.unimelb.edu.au/00003661/01/Architecture.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/1892</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Social regulation,reproductive technology and the public interest: policy and process in pioneering jurisdictions</field><field name="creator">Szoke,  Helen</field><field name="description">In the last three decades regulation as a public policy instrument has developed from a tool to manage markets to a means for government to offer protection or impose boundaries in areas associated with social and moral issues.

This thesis describes the development and derivation of a methodology for the estimation of low flow characteristics and yield in small ungauged rural catchments. The methodology has been applied to 184 catchments located in New South Wales and Victoria, in south-eastern Australia. A systems approach was adopted in which multivariate techniques were used to develop relationships between low flow parameters and climatic and land information data.  The low flow and yield parameters considered include: descriptive statistics of monthly and annual flows, ratio of baseflow to total streamflow volumes, streamflow recession constants, flow duration curves for daily, monthly and annual durations, low flow frequency curves for durations from 1 to 284 days, duration of low flow spells below a given threshold, deficiency volume of low flow spells below a given threshold, estimate of storage to satisfy a specified draft at a given level of reliability, and parameters of a simple rainfall-runoff model for conversion of daily rainfall to monthly streamflow volumes.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">hydrology in Victoria, methodology, hydrology in New South Wales</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.infodiv.unimelb.edu.au/00003826/01/nathanrjfinal1.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/1917</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A timely visit: the role of the Great White Fleet, naval defence and the press in the British-Australian relationship</field><field name="creator">Sanders, Frank</field><field name="description">When the Great White Fleet visited Australia in 1908 it became the focal point of an on-going test of wills between Britain and Australia. Relations between the two countries had become increasingly strained since Britain&#8217;s decision in the mid-nineteenth century to establish a new kind of relationship with its colonies. For the Australian colonies this meant moving towards independence within the Empire framework and assuming more responsibility for their own defence. This change had serious repercussions for the Australian colonies and British-Australian relations. Politically and psychologically the Australian colonies had developed an image of themselves as the inferior daughters of the superior and protective Mother Country. By changing the nature of the British-Australian colonial relationship, Britain not only challenged this Australian colonial self-image, it also heightened existing divisions among the Australian colonists. Anglo- Australian loyalists, enamoured of things British, clung to the established colonial image and remained subservient to Imperial wishes. Australian nationalists, on the other hand, tried to establish a new relationship with Britain, one in which Australian colonial concerns would have a greater voice.

The thesis discusses the interpretations of the Qur&#8217;anic verses which became the root of Muslim controversies over polygamy. Indonesian Muslim interpretations of polygamy can be divided into three groups based on Saeed&#8217;s categorisation of the Muslim approaches to the Qur&#8217;an (2006b: 3). First, the group he refers to as the &#8216;Textualists&#8217; believe that polygamy is permitted in Islam, and regard it as a male right. Second, the group he refers to as &#8216;Semi-textualists&#8217; believe that Islam discourages polygamy and prefers monogamy; therefore, polygamy can only be permitted under certain circumstances such as when a wife is barren, sick and unable to fulfil her duties, including &#8216;serving&#8217; her husband&#8217;s needs. Third, the group he calls &#8216;Contextualists&#8217; believe that Islam implicitly prohibits polygamy because just treatment of more than one woman, the main requirement for polygamy, is impossible to achieve.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">polygamy, Islamic law, Indonesia, marriage law</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.infodiv.unimelb.edu.au/00003847/01/Nina_thesis.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/1963</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Leachate chemistry of two modern municipal waste landfills in Melbourne, Victoria</field><field name="creator">Strudwick,  Darryl Grant</field><field name="description">This study investigates the occurrence and chemical composition of leachate at Clayton South and Brooklyn Municipal waste landfills in Melbourne, Victoria.

The research undertakes a detailed study of The Campaign, using empirical data derived from classroom observations, online communications, and semi-structured interviews. It undertakes a qualitative analysis of these data using an interpretive approach informed by models drawn from social theory and sociotechnical theory.  Educational authors argue that online educational role-plays engage students in authentic learning, and represent an improvement over didactic teaching strategies. According to this literature, online role-play systems afford students the opportunity of acting and doing instead of only reading and listening. Literature in social theory and social studies of technology takes a different view of certain concepts such as performance, identity and reality.  Models such as actor-network theory ask us to consider all actors in the sociotechnical network in order to understand how society and technology are related. This thesis examines these concepts by addressing a series of research questions, such as how students become engaged with identities, how identities are mediated, and the extent to which roles in these role-plays are shaped by the system, the scenario, and the agency of the actors themselves.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">role-play, tertiary, education, identity, online, epistemology, sociology, performance</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.infodiv.unimelb.edu.au/00002885/01/RolesActorsPerformManuscriptFinal.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/2164</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Online vicarious-experience: using technology to help consumers evaluate physical products over the Internet</field><field name="creator">Smith, Stephen Patrick</field><field name="description">This research investigates ways to help shoppers evaluate physical products via the Internet.

Yet two decades later, while there is a large body of geodetic literature addressing the positional accuracy of point features, there is little research addressing the positional accuracy of linear features, and still no accepted accuracy model for linear features. It has not helped that national map and data accuracy standards continue to define accuracy only in terms of &#8220;well-defined points&#8221;. This research aims to address these shortcomings by exploring the effect on linear feature positional accuracy of feature type, complexity, segment length, vertex proximity and e-scale, that is, the scale of the paper map from which the data were originally captured or to which they are customised for output.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">geomatics, GIS, positional accuracy, linear features</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.infodiv.unimelb.edu.au/00002927/02/Lawford_final_document.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/2027</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Facilitating &#8216;green&#8217; building: turning observation into practice</field><field name="creator">Hes,  Dominique</field><field name="description">This thesis is the story of my five year journey developing a practice in integrating &#8216;green&#8217; innovation within the built environment&#8212;mainly in new buildings.

Relations among individuals are represented by a network or networks of interpersonal ties. The first part of the thesis describes models solely for such sets of relational ties.

The research is based on a comprehensive assessment and synthesis of field and laboratory measurements of vegetation flow resistance.  A new numerical model is developed to estimate the roughness characteristics of multi-species riparian assemblages at a cross-section.  Reach-scale and catchment-scale flood routing models are then applied to estimate the impact of vegetation on flood characteristics at successively larger scales.  The investigation reveals that when riparian vegetation is removed at catchment-scale, peak stage declines as channel capacity increases but is also increased as the upstream catchment responds more rapidly to rain.  In fact, the two competing impacts tend to cancel out leaving flood peak stage relatively insensitive to riparian condition.  However, the overbank duration of a flood and flow speeds (including wave celerity) were both found to be sensitive to vegetation condition; respectively increasing and decreasing with density of vegetation.  The first stage of this research examines the magnitude of the vegetation contribution to overall channel roughness, and established a means to predict it.  The features of the flow resistance generated by six plant types (mature trees; grasses; aquatic plants; flexible saplings; and large woody debris) were distilled from a comprehensive review of over 160 existing publications (Chapter 2).</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">flood, vegetation resistance, riparian vegetation, rehabilitation, hydrodynamic drag</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.infodiv.unimelb.edu.au/00002595/01/AndersonBG_PhD.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/2086</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Targeting during armed conflict: a legal analysis</field><field name="creator">Henderson, Ian Scott</field><field name="description">This thesis deals with the law applicable to targeting during an armed conflict &#8212; in particular, the law concerning military objectives and the rule of proportionality.

This will allow for the determination of legal responsibility for discrete steps in a targeting decision. This should prove particularly useful in two situations. First, it will enable military commanders to appreciate what needs to be considered in each targeting decision and thereby ensure that somebody is assigned responsibility for each discrete step. Second, in the event of an investigation into an alleged targeting mishap, it will be possible to identify who had, or at least should have had, responsibility for discrete aspects of the overall targeting decision.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">targeting, armed conflict, military objectives, proportionality, Additional Protocol I, precautions, attack</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.infodiv.unimelb.edu.au/00004217/01/PhD_thesis_-_Targeting_during_armed_conflict_-_a_legal_analysis_-_Ian_Henderson.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/2232</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Weierstrass points and canonical cell decompositions of the moduli and Teichmuller Spaces of Riemann surfaces of genus two</field><field name="creator">Amaris, Armando Jose Rodado</field><field name="description">A genus-two Riemann surface   admits a canonical decomposition into Dirichlet  polygons determined by its six Weierstrass points.

To the international community, this act of declaratory sovereignty claimed Australia for Britain. Gaining practical legal authority over the indigenous population, however, took years and a number of court cases to obtain. The British established their sovereignty over the Australian Aborigines by integrating them into the British legal system. This legal incorporation eventuated in stages. Three important stages were: first in 1790, when the British attempted to punish Aborigines for the murder of white men, secondly in 1827, when the British tried to punish white settlers for the deaths of indigenes, and lastly in 1836 when the British decided to punish indigenes for murders committed amongst themselves. Previous colonial experience influenced British officials&#8217; dealing with the indigenous population of Australia. Many of the colonisers who settled in Australia, Britain&#8217;s penultimate colony, had lived in other parts of the British Empire.

Although national SDI developments are fundamental to building the SDI culture and policy, it is sub-national and local SDI development that will deliver the immediate benefits to citizens and the community.  In countries which have highly decentralised federations of states such as Australia, United States and Canada, the challenge is how to co-ordinate the literally thousands of often small local government jurisdictions which are important contributors to state and local SDIs.  In recent years, a number of co-operative spatial data sharing partnerships between local and state government have emerged in various countries around the world.  These partnerships are relatively new initiatives that have been established to facilitate more effective sharing of spatial data between organisations, but also as a mechanism to contribute to SDI development.  To maximise the benefits from these partnerships it is essential to understand the factors that contribute to their successful operation and sustainability.

The repaired test specimen was tested under a lateral cyclic load as per the original test arrangement up to a drift level of 4%. The performance of the repaired specimen showed significant improvement with respect to the level of damage and strength degradation.

Using a set of chromosome-specific &#945;-satellite probes for each of the human chromosomes, interphase Fluorescence In Situ Hybridisation (FISH) was performed in a population screening study. This study demonstrated that extreme reduction of chromosome-specific &#945;-satellite is unusually common in chromosome 21 (screened with the &#945;RI probe), with a prevalence of 3.70%, compared to &lt;=.12 % for each of chromosomes 13 and 17, and 0 % for the other chromosomes.

Sensitive metaphase FISH analysis of the low-alphoid chromosome 21 centromeres established the presence of residual &#945;RI as well as other non-&#945;RI &#945;-satellite DNA suggesting that centromere function may be provided by (i) the residual &#945;RI DNA, (ii) other non-&#945;RI a-satellite sequences, (iii) a combination of i and ii, or (iv) an activated neocentromere DNA.

BI combines an additive, or intuitionistic, fragment with a multiplicative fragment. The additive fragment has full use of the structural rules of weakening and contraction, and the multiplicative fragment has none. Thus it contains two conjunctive and two implicative connectives. At various points, we illustrate a resource view of BI based upon the Kripke resource semantics. Our first original contribution is the formulation of a proof system for BI in the newly developed proof-theoretical formalism of the calculus of structures. The calculus of structures is distinguished by its employment of deep inference, but we already see deep inference in a limited form in the established proof theory for BI. We show that our system is sound with respect to the elementary Kripke resource semantics for BI, and complete with respect to a formulation of the partially-defined Kripke resource semantics. Our second contribution is the development from a semantic standpoint of preliminary ideas for a hybrid logic of bunched implications (HBI). We give a Kripke semantics for HBI in which nominal propositional atoms can be seen as names for resources, rather than as names for locations, as is the case with related proposals for BI-Loc and for intuitionistic hybrid logic.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">logic of bunched implications, Kripke semantics, proof theory, calculus of structures, hybrid logics</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/2419</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Object-oriented concepts for land and geographic information systems</field><field name="creator">Hesse,  Walter Josef Heinrich</field><field name="description">This research studies the impact of Object Oriented Programming Systems (OOPS) and their underlying concepts on Land and Geographic Information Systems (LIS/GIS) in Australasia.

This thesis investigates the export of phosphorus in overland flow from pasture-based grazing systems in south-eastern Australia. Initially, field-scale monitoring is used to investigate the forms of phosphorus in overland flow with a view to identifying the primary mobilisation process. It is shown that from a well-managed pasture, phosphorus was primarily mobilised as a result of dissolution rather than physical detachment (erosion) processes. Phosphorus in the overland flow is shown to be predominantly in the dissolved reactive form (DRP). It follows that remedial strategies that rely on physically trapping phosphorus entrained in overland flow (i.e. buffer strips and riparian zones) are unlikely to be effective. The field-scale monitoring data are then used to investigate the structure of phosphorus exports. It is shown that the data conforms to a base-plus-increments model. It is proposed that phosphorus exports can be divided into a base or systematic component that results from a particular land use management system, and an incremental or incidental (preventable) component that is the result of particular management decisions, activities or incidents.

These simulations show that in electron microscopy at atomic resolution and in other similar situations, vortices occur in the wave functions very frequently. This means any image processing methods which deal with the wave function phase must permit vortices to occur. In this context a number of methods of phase retrieval are compared and evaluated. The criteria of evaluation are the accuracy of the phase retrieval, its ability to cope with vortices, its numerical stability and its required computational resources. The best method is found to be an iterative algorithm similar in approach to the Gerchberg-Saxton method, but based on a through focal series of images.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">phase retrieval, inversion problem, electron diffraction, aberrations, vortices</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.infodiv.unimelb.edu.au/00000759/02/02_Whole.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/2880</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Understanding poverty: perspectives from poor rural people in Oyo State, Nigeria</field><field name="creator">Akindola, Rufus Boluwaji</field><field name="description">This thesis is an attempt to fill the gap in our knowledge about rural poverty and what it means to be poor.

It explores the word &#8216;money&#8217; itself, contrasting the way it is used/defined in the economics discourse with the way it has been approached in the psychological discourse. The thesis crosses disciplinary boundaries in an attempt to come closer to the everyday, personal experience of money. It unwraps the childhood history of money, showing how adult money attitudes emerge from unconscious predispositions and childhood experience. It demonstrates the importance of &#8216;control&#8217; as a variable and the lifelong balancing act which takes place between spending and saving. Today, the form of money is in the process of change. It has undergone significant changes before: the nineteenth century adoption of paper money upset the bullionists as much as plastic or virtual money can unsettle traditionalists at the end of the twentieth century. Attitudes to the underlying substance 'money' remain relevant, whatever physical form the currency takes. Thus, gold and silver coins, the treasure of childhood pirate stories, may retain mental currency long after their demise as physical currency. Indeed, the more money becomes abstracted from something tangible, the more it is necessary to understand the primal nature of the underpinning attitudes that are affected.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">money, psychological aspects, economics discourse, money attitudes, spending, saving, psychology of money, childhood influences, psychoanalysis and money, controlling money</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/2828</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/2828</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Pious tales and dirty stories : the Young Australians Best Book Award (YABBA)</field><field name="creator">La Marca, Susan Gaye</field><field name="description">A study of the older readers' section of Young Australians Best Book Award (YABBA) from 1986 to 1991, based on analysis of 21,351 voting forms from this period. Through analysis of the data from these voting forms, ranking authors and titles, comparing gender preferences, the source of the book voted for, school type and school location were all compiled into graphs and tables. Appropriate comparisons have been made between variables across the six year period, to give some idea of the voting population involved in the older readers' section of YABBA and their preferences and motivations. A follow up survey of voters and YABBA organisers in 1992 attempted to further enhance this data by collecting information on voter preferences, opinions and possible influences on the voting process. The study attempts to place YABBA in the context of the wider children's literature community and discuss briefly its historical development with reference to other children's choice awards, their strengths and weaknesses. A relevant discussion on popularity versus literary merit is related to the ongoing discussion of YABBA in comparison to the Children's Book Council awards. Later chapters include a discussion of the most popular YABBA titles (seven highest rating titles) with particular emphasis given to YABBA's two most popular authors - Paul Jennings and Robin Klein. Humour is an important factor in the popularity of many YABBA titles and this is discussed as are developments since 1991 and the long-term future of YABBA.</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">children's literary prizes Victoria, books and reading</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/2354</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/2354</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Architectures and technologies for wavelength division multiplexed access networks</field><field name="creator">Nadarajah, Nishaanthan</field><field name="description">Optical fibre communication is very much preferred for the communication of signals over bandwidth of a gigabits per second over distances more than hundreds of kilometres. For a long period of time optical fibre communication has been about how to provide higher bandwidths with reduced cost per bit transmitted. However, this trend has changed from optical transmission to optical networking. By exploiting the wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) technology, optical networks have expanded from backbone networks to metropolitan and access networks to deliver high bandwidth services to the users in a seamless fashion with reduced cost. The ultimate evolution of the optical access network involves fibre-to-the-home (FTTH) technologies, which can potentially offer every kind of information and communication related services. Out of all FTTH technologies, the passive optical network (PON) can potentially offer the most cost-effective solution as the optical network is shared between a number of end users. PONs have significant advantage over competing access technologies as the fibre infrastructure can be effectively future-proofed for upgrades. A number of demonstrations have been carried out for the cost effective deployment of the PONs. However, as these networks evolve, advanced functionalities have to be added over the existing end to end transmissions between the service providers and end users.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">optical fibre communication, optical transmission, optical networking, wavelength division multiplexing, optical access network</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.infodiv.unimelb.edu.au/00001879/01/Thesis.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/215</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Boundary crossing probabilities for diffusion processes and related problems</field><field name="creator">Downes, Andrew Nicholas</field><field name="description">This thesis is concerned with boundary crossing probabilities and first crossing time densities for stochastic processes. This is a classical problem in probability that goes back to the famous ballot problem (first studied by W. A. Whitworth (1878) and J.

Our main objective is the study of approximation methods and control of the resulting approximation error for boundary crossing probabilities where a closed-form solution is unavailable. This leads to the study of bounds for the density of the first crossing time of the boundary, which in turn leads to the derivation of some analytic properties of the densities.

The extent to which native wildlife may also be causing change to their environment, as a result of local increases in population density, has been the subject of debate in a number of countries. In Australia there has been a growing awareness in recent years that native herbivores, particularly kangaroos and wallabies, may also be causing changes to ecosystem dynamics. Environmmental changes, produced firstly by the aboriginal people and then by Europeans, have favoured the larger macropods, resulting in increased population levels. These impacts can also be seen in areas around cities, where pressure from urbanisation has restricted populations to smaller and smaller patches of remnant vegetation and reserves, increasing the pressure on diminishing food resources within these patches. This study focuses on one of the areas that supplies drinking water to Melbourne, the Yan Yean Reservoir catchment, which is situated 37 km north east of Melbourne.

She taught in government schools for over thirty years ending her career as headmistress of Flemington Girls&#8217; School. She was an active unionist and at one time was vice president of the Victorian Teachers&#8217; Union. She was a social and peace activist. She was a passionate advocate of equal pay and cared deeply about the welfare of the children she worked with, her fellow teachers and society in general. She travelled in England and Russia and in 1937 represented Australian women teacher unionists at the Pan Pacific Women&#8217;s Conference in Vancouver. She joined the Communist Party in 1938, teaching for them at Marx House in Melbourne and writing articles in their publication the Guardian. At the peak of her career, her activities were monitored by conservative politicians and the Catholic Church. She first came under the notice of the Commonwealth Investigation Service (later ASIO) in 1939 and was the subject of heated debate in the Victorian Parliament in 1946. Forced out of teaching as a result of a Royal Commission into Communism in 1950, Doris McRae then put all her energies into the activities of the Union of Australian Women, her active involvement lasting until the 1980s. In 1952 she travelled as an Australian delegate to the Defence of Children Conference in Vienna. Her last trip overseas was in 1960 when she spent most of the year in Europe. When Doris McRae died in 1988 aged 95, a memorial service was held for her at Coburg High School.

It is based on analyses of national longitudinal data covering a period of almost twenty years, from the late 1970s to the mid 1990s.  Data from four separate age-based cohorts of young people are analysed, with a focus on the youngest cohort, that born in 1975, as well as additional data from a more recent sample of students who were in Year 9 in 1995.  The extent of student involvement in part-time work is described, with reference to rates of employment and to average hours worked per week.  Although there is some variation by age and year level, by the early 1990s one third of senior school students spent an average of nine hours per week in a part-time job.  The background characteristics of student-workers are examined.  Students who were lower school achievers were less likely to be employed, as were those from lower socioeconomic status backgrounds.  These patterns, matching observations from other countries in which there are comparable or higher rates of student employment, indicate that some students may be disadvantaged in this part-time job market.  Students had generally positive perceptions of their jobs.  A large proportion enjoyed their work, and the money and the independence that it gave them, and they believed it would improve their future employment prospects.  Apart from these subjective views of students, the longitudinal nature of these data enabled the outcomes of in-school employment to be investigated.

The thesis asks whether aid policy processes indicate a willingness, or capacity, on the part of official donors to more fully engage with the causal complexity of development, and so potentially improve development outcomes. Considering the case study of the Australian bilateral aid program to Papua New Guinea from both top-down and bottom-up policy perspectives, the thesis concludes that, in relation to Australia, there are significant structural and institutional impediments to change. The Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and its interpretation of national interest, dominate high-level aid policy-making, even though the objectives of foreign policy and those of foreign aid differ. Australia's official development agency, AusAID, is limited in its capacity to legitimately challenge this dominance, not least because its use of contracted-out projects restrict its corporate knowledge and its ability to influence policy agendas and networks. Overcoming this impasse requires creative management on the part of senior public servants and non-governmental members of the aid policy community alike.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">foreign aid, good governance, AusAID, Australian Government, Papua New Guinea, contracting, Australian Managing Contractors, project management, international relations, public policy</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.infodiv.unimelb.edu.au/00000842/01/davis.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/1024</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The social context of femicide in Victoria</field><field name="creator">Muller, Damon Anthony</field><field name="description">Femicide, homicide involving female victims, accounts for approximately one third of all homicides in Australia. Despite its prevalence, femicide has received considerably less theoretical attention than the more common male-on-male homicide. The current study uses qualitative data from the Coroner&#8217;s brief of evidence to examine the social context of homicides which occurred between 1994 and 1998 in Victoria, Australia. All homicides for which data were available that included a female victim were included in the study, resulting in a total of 67 victims. Six social contexts of femicide were identified through the cases. Intimate femicide (22 cases, 33% of the sample) involved female victims who were killed by their intimate partner in a relationship characterised by jealousy, possessiveness and violence. These intimate femicides were usually not spontaneous acts of rage, but planned and purposive attacks, and often occurred around separation. Intimate homicide-suicides (9 cases, 13%) shared many of the characteristics of intimate femicide, but in addition to being possessive and violent, the offender was notably depressed, often due to financial problems.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">homicide, femicide, victimology, domestic violence, family violence, homicide-suicide, sexual homicide</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.infodiv.unimelb.edu.au/00001668/01/thesis.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/603</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Solid-gel interactions in geopolymers</field><field name="creator">Lee,  William K.</field><field name="description">This is partly because the requirements for such an ultimate material change with people&#8217;s perception about its properties as well as its environmental impact.

This study proposes that the enactive curriculum is not merely deviant from the declared curriculum; rather, it is part of the curriculum-making process. Teachers necessarily produce the curriculum as an object of study which students encounter in the classroom. This object of study expresses the teacher&#8217;s conception of what students need to learn, and is intelligibly related to what they do learn. To explore this idea, the research project focused on the study of physics and history at Year 12, where teachers used a common curriculum and worked to a common external examination. Teachers of these subjects were interviewed about their practice and what they wanted students to learn. A phenomenographic analysis of these interviews showed a systematic relationship between the teacher&#8217;s focus and the embedded metaphors s/he used to describe students&#8217; learning.  In physics and history, the teachers&#8217; conceptions formed a parallel sequence. What was to be studied was described in a widening context: from a narrow focus on facts or algorithms, to a wider view of a body of knowledge or theory, to a relational view where the physicist or the historian was seen to construct theoretical interpretations or readings of relevant detail. There was corresponding variation in the questions and tasks in which students were engaged.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">curriculum planning, curriculum change, case studies of high schools in Victoria, physics history teaching learning and "object of study"</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.infodiv.unimelb.edu.au/00000293/01/katepatrick.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/1044</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effects of boron-treated timbers against coptotermes species in Australia</field><field name="creator">Ahmed,  Berhan Mahmoud</field><field name="description">In Australia the protection of building timbers from termites relied for many years upon the application of persistent organochlorines as well as the organophosphate compound (chlorpyrifos) and the synthetic pyrethroid (bifenthrin) as soil chemical barriers (Lenz et al. 1990; Watson, 1990; NHMRC, 1992; AS 3660.1 1995). The persistent organochlorines have been banned since 1987 in the USA and from June 1995 in all Australian states except the Northern Territory. The study evaluated the life-cycle of boron as an alternative wood preservative, its toxicity to foraging populations of subterranean termites (&#8216;termites&#8217;) over time were particularly referred to the influence of foraging space and determined a suitable loading of boron in timber for hazard class2 (H2) conditions as defined in Australian standard-1997. Preservative treatment of timber according to Australian Standard 1604 (1997) prevents attack and damage of wood and wood products from biodeteriogens (namely fungi and insects). Above-ground interior timber framings are not normally liable to decay but to damage by wood-destroying insects. The study examined the use of borates as wood preservatives to prevent attack and damage by subterranean termites (&#8216;termites&#8217;) of the genus of Coptotermes. In addressing the aims of this study, several different avenues of approach were followed. The chapter sequence in this thesis follows the pattern of measuring the effects of borates on a wide range from 20 termites in laboratory bioassay to thousands of termites in natural colonies.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">boron, boron-treated timbers, coptotermes species, timber</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.infodiv.unimelb.edu.au/00000234/01/Ahmed.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/1079</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Holographic imaging of cold atoms</field><field name="creator">Turner, Lincoln David</field><field name="description">This thesis presents a new optical imaging technique which measures the structure of objects without the use of lenses.

The history of Arena Theatre Company is documented in relation to the development of Theatre in Education from its British roots to the Company&#8217;s current emphasis on contemporary artists exploring the possibilities of multi-art form technology. The development of multi-media usage in theatre over the past century is outlined in order to gain an understanding of Arena&#8217;s place within this technological experimentation. Utilising ethnographic methodology, including participant observation, &#8220;unstructured&#8221; interactive interviews and the construction of participant monologues, the creative rehearsal and planning process of Eat Your Young is chartered over a five month period. The outcomes of the study confirm the literature relating to the qualities of a good director: they are leadership, vision and the ability to collaborate.

I offer historical and theoretical explorations of various media technologies and genres, and propose that todays visual culture may be described as participatory, primarily in the sense that its modes of address function to blur the line between the production and consumption of imagery. Furthermore, I suggest that these participatory relations, underpinned by real time media, are productive of performative subjects composed, under the prevailing media imaginary, of increasingly individualised exchanges. Thus, I argue that the phenomenon of media participation must be considered in relation to defining characteristics of contemporary capitalism namely its user-focused, customised and individuated orientation. Organised in terms of historical, theoretical and generic sections, two opening chapters establish, respectively, the technological and theoretical context of the inquiry, preparing for four subsequent chapters concerned with media genres. Chapter 1 argues that contemporary media are home to new image forms that are, as a result of their participatory and networked character, more performative than merely representational. Chapter 2 introduces the concept of indivisualisation referring to participatory visual environments in which the performance of the individual viewing subject is crucial to the nature of the viewing relationship. Drawing on a wide range of media theorists including Jonathan Crary, Margaret Morse, Lev Manovich and Manuel Castells, as well as contemporary sociologists Ulrich Beck and Zygmunt Bauman, I make a connection between the personalised address and coextensive temporal performances characteristic of participatory media and a pervasive social demand for compulsory, ongoing self-transformation. Performative subjectivity, I argue, is the logical counterpart to real-time screens, and its prevailing mode is individualised. The remaining four chapters seek to elaborate and substantiate the dynamics of participation and indivisualisation by exploring a series of exemplary real-time media genres,news media, reality entertainment media (reality television and webcams), computer games, and media art.

Trance is considered to be the result of sustained involvement with detailed information that is structurally organised, invoking imaginative and affective engagements that are maintained as interactions between the performer, other performers, the environment and audience of the performance. This thesis investigates trance performance through the conceptual lens of dramatic arts practice. In their respective cultural contexts, trance and theatre attain qualities considered as sacredness. Trance practice and performance, across a range of cultural contexts, are analysed as social processes - as elements of power relations that influence the performer, audience and environment of the performance. As performance traditions and events, this study will examine strands of praxis that can be drawn from Constantin Stanislavski to Lee Strasberg to Mike Leigh; from Antonin Artaud to Samuel Beckett and Jerzy Grotowski; from the Balinese trance performance form of Sanghyang Dedari in the 1930s to the 1990s; from the Channeling practitioners in the U.S. in the 1930s to Seth and Lazaris in the 1970s to the 1990s; and from traditions of military training, performance violence, and rhetoric associated with the attacks of the 11th of September 2001 in the U.S. and its aftermath.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">trance, performance, theatre, cults, 9/11 attacks, social drama</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.infodiv.unimelb.edu.au/00000529/01/ron1.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/1390</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Constructing and contesting the nation: the use and meaning of Sukarno's monuments and public places in Jakarta</field><field name="creator">Permanasari, Eka</field><field name="description">Architecture and urban design are often powerful expressions of political desires to support and legitimise specific regimes.

However, there is one course which, although it is rooted in African-American music, promulgates the notion that Australian students in the 1990s should endeavour to develop a personal musical &#8220;voice&#8221;. This is Improvisation Studies, a three year degree program at the Victorian College of the Arts in Melbourne, Australia. This study sought to clarify what was meant by a personal voice by monitoring the development of selected students. Given that the notion of a personal voice as an outcome is a novel one, the study adopted an investigatory discovery-based approach. This required intensive study of selected students on the grounds that the development of a personal voice manifests itself in different ways. A second major purpose of the study was to investigate factors which affected the development of the personal voice. Key factors included the ways in which the VCA course encouraged the development of this voice, as well as the characteristics that students brought to the course and which possibly reflected their musical educational background.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">music, jazz, improvisation, Africa, America</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.infodiv.unimelb.edu.au/00000219/01/McMillan.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/1483</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Homodyne Crosstalk in Wavelength-Division Multiplexed Ring and Bus Networks</field><field name="creator">Dods,  Sarah D.</field><field name="description">Crosstalk in optical communications systems is caused by small, interfering optical signals arriving at a receiver simultaneously with a desired signal.  The interfering signals degrade the quality of the data channel that is modulated on to the desired signal, causing an increase in its bit-error rate.  Optical crosstalk can be classified as either heterodyne, if the main and interfering signals are at different wavelengths, or homodyne, if the signals have the same nominal wavelength.  Homodyne crosstalk is the more insidious of the two, as it cannot be removed by filtering at the receiver, and may cause much greater signal degradation. Wavelength-division multiplexed (WDM) networks are particularly susceptible to optical crosstalk, because they transport multiple optical signals at various wavelengths.  Ring and bus networks represent the simplest physical topology that is used in WDM networks.  In these structures, each node is connected to a central trunk, providing only one possible path between two nodes (or two for a bi-directional ring).

In a bilateral analysis, Part I establishes criteria for evaluating modes of ego and relates these criteria to what is known about medieval culture and mentality with examples from the lyrics; Part II examines textual evidence from these poems for indications of notions of the self and the way the self is experienced. The thesis argues that a major source of medieval alterity lies in the ready access in the Middle Ages to modes of consciousness comparable to that identified by the archetypal psychologist James Hillman as an imaginal ego. The imaging of various aspects of the self is surveyed: body-consciousness, modes of perception, and major self-awareness-enhancing experiences of life-suffering, woundedness, sickness, old age, and death. Hypnotic aspects of the lyrics are found to be particularly significant in maintaining this consciousness.

This narrative, relational self is diminished in old age by bereavement and the loss of social networks, and threatened by the loneliness and isolation of the institutional environment. Nonetheless, despite the stripping of relational layers entailed in the loss of the people with whom the younger self was constructed, there is a continuing core of self which, while bending, does not break.

The surface porosity of several oxides to ions is evaluated and the contribution of such porosity to the double layer properties determined by surface charge measurements.  The oxides studied are B.D.H. precipitated silica, before and after heat treatment, rutile, goethite, hematite and amorphous ferric oxide.  The surface porosity was evaluated using nitrogen adsorption for physical porosity, tritium exchange for surface hydration and dissolution for surface crystallinity.  It is found that the surfaces of metal oxides may be divided into two categories; those that are porous to ions and those that are non-porous.  Of those studied only the precipitated silica and the amorphous ferric oxide are porous.  The porosity is probably due to an easily permeated layer of hydrolysed oxidic material.  It does lead to exceptionally high surface charges.  However the non-porous oxides also exhibit high surface charges so that while surface porosity may, in some cases, contribute to oxide double layer properties, it cannot be a general explanation of the high differential capacities observed.  A site-binding model for non-porous oxide/aqueous electrolyte interfaces is introduced, in which it is proposed that the adsorbed counter ions form interfacial ion pairs with discrete charged surface groups.  This model is used to calculate theoretical surface charge densities and potentials at the Outer Helmholtz Plane. The calculated values are consistent with experimental data for oxides provided a high value of the inner zone capacity is accepted.  An explanation is provided for the difference between silica and most other oxides in terms of the dissociation constants of the surface groups.</field><field name="date">1975</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">metallic oxides, porosity, surface chemistry</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/2348</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/2348</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">'Weapons of mass destruction': the health impact of human rights violations in the context of Austalian asylum policies</field><field name="creator">Johnston, Vanessa</field><field name="description">Over the past decade, scholars from the disciplines of both public health and law have increasingly acknowledged that health and human rights are inextricably linked. Perhaps most significant in the evolution of the health and human rights paradigm is the recognition that violations of human rights have adverse consequences for health. While this is most apparent in relation to, for example, torture, the empirical evidence for the health impact of other rights violations has, to date, been scarce. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between current Australian asylum policies, which arguably represent human rights violations, and the health and wellbeing of refugees who have been subject to these policies. A mixed-methods study design was undertaken to address the study aim. A comparative cross-sectional survey of 71 Iraqi Temporary Protection Visa (TPV) holders and 60 Iraqi Permanent Humanitarian Visa (PHV) holders, residing in the Northern suburbs of Melbourne, Australia, was conducted. A purposive sampling frame was utilised owing to the fact that a random selection of participants was not feasible. Iraqi temporary and permanent refugees surveyed were comparable across key demographic criteria, and were also broadly representative of the wider Iraqi refugee population in the study site, according to available data. The survey included standardised self-report measures assessing psychosocial constructs which were hypothesised to be significant in the experience of TPV holders (e.g. perceived life constraints, social support, and sense of injustice), and health outcomes, both physical and psychological. Socioeconomic stressors were also measured.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/2363</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/2363</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Unveiling the melodic interval: a phenomenology of the musical element in human consciousness</field><field name="creator">Killian-O'Callaghan, Danae</field><field name="description">This phenomenology begins with an observation of a musical instrument, the piano. The piano is surrounded by an aura of lifelessness, for its sound world is dominated by tone-decay and a calcified intonation system. Therefore, a physically seamless legato rendering of melody is impossible for pianists, and the inflexible symmetry of given intervallic relations enforces a loss of tonal centre when a composer ventures into the intrinsically asymmetrical domain of chromaticism. However, the melodic interval - the element lying between the acoustically sounding pitches - is in essence always inaudible, whatever the instrument. Through the development of listening capacities directed specifically toward unveiling the non-positive musical element in its origin, namely, within human consciousness, it is possible to overcome external instrumental limitations. Human being&#8217;s intrinsic musicality is revealed through phenomenological observation of consciousness in its qualitatively differentiated, ordinarily related, temporally unfolding nature. External limitations can have no hold over living melodic expression when the essence of the melodic interval is discovered self-sufficiently within the non-positive dimension of human onticity, that is, within a consciousness in which the potential for clear spiritual cognition lies dormant. &#8216;Tonicness&#8217; is discovered ultimately to be an inner awareness of self-voicefulness, independent from instrumental and linguistic contingencies; and the piano reveals an historical mission to awaken - from &#8216;death&#8217; - new cognitive listening faculties.

Many tasks tackled by NLP can be framed as classification, where we seek to assign a label to a particular piece of text, be it a word, sentence or document. Yet often the labels which we&#8217;d like to assign exhibit complex internal structure, such as labelling a sentence with its parse tree, and there may be an exponential number of them to choose from. Structured classification seeks to exploit the structure of the labels in order to allow both generalisation across labels which differ by only a small amount, and tractable searches over all possible labels. In this thesis we focus on the application of conditional random field (CRF) models (Lafferty et al., 2001). These models assign an undirected graphical structure to the labels of the classification task and leverage dynamic programming algorithms to efficiently identify the optimal label for a given input. We develop a range of models for two multilingual NLP applications: word-alignment for statistical machine translation (SMT), and multilingual super tagging for highly lexicalised grammars.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">NLP, machine learning, structured classification, word alignment, supertagging, machine translation</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.infodiv.unimelb.edu.au/00003814/01/thesis.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/1601</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Re-examining Van Eyck: a new analysis of the Ince Hall Virgin and Child</field><field name="creator">Hudson,  Hugh</field><field name="description">The Ince Hall Virgin and child is a painting of the Virgin and Child in an interior that was attributed to Jan van Eyck by the leading historians of early Netherlandish art from 1854 to 1956.

Subsequently, a number of art historians have suggested that not even the composition of the work is Eyckian, and that the work is a pastiche based on Van Eyck&#8217;s paintings. Nevertheless, some authors have doubted the arguments for these reattributions. Some authors maintain the attributions to Van Eyck, and others suggest that the work may be a copy.

Strategies for improving the visual welfare of these people need to be appropriate to the local situation.  In 1992 a proposal was devised to address the lack of eye care in Papua New Guinea. This thesis examines the outcome of this proposal and reports on the ophthalmic data collected by these trained eye nurses.Method:  In 1994, 11 National nurses were trained in a 3 month intensive course to become &#8216;eye nurses&#8217;.  A basic set of equipment was provided to each eye nurse. Appropriate follow-up and annual conferences supported this initial training.  A second group of 14 eye nurses were trained in 1997. Monthly eye clinic reports from the eye nurses provide significant data on eye conditions and visual welfare in PNGResults:   After 6 years 80% of the eye nurses were still actively working in eye care. An analysis was made of the eye conditions of the 30,000 patients   examined by the eye nurses over this 6 year period. The data is generally consistent with previous ophthalmic data from Papua New Guinea. The eye nurses were able to provide appropriate eye care for 80% of the presenting patients without Optometric or Ophthalmic assistance.Conclusions:   Training nurses to become &#8216;eye nurses&#8217; functioning as basic optometrists is an effective strategy in improving eye care in developing countries.

It also responds to debate on the use of postmodern aesthetic techniques in performance, as a means of critically engaging with and commentating on Western, specifically American, culture and politics. The hypothesis of this study is that monologue, as it is examined in this work, is a biopolitical form. It is biopolitical, as this analysis will show, in the sense that it is a linguistic, communicational and creative response to the conditions of global capitalism in the West. The study argues that the term monologue is increasingly inadequate to the discussion of these new forms of solo speech and performance and proffers the term &#8220;post-monologue&#8221; as a means of furthering consideration of the monologue beyond the terms of current understandings.

It postulates that the potential long-term outcomes of a successful CCD process, including the creation of communities and networks, as well as continuing cultural development for the participants, are frustrated by arts policy and funding. The analysis of the Case Study is contextualised by an examination of the history of CCD in Australia and the cultural policy framework for the funding of CCD projects.This thesis addresses the following question: Do the long-term outcomes - of creating networks, creation of communities and continued cultural development - succeed? It is hypothesised that CCD can achieve social change through two types of long term outcomes. The two types of long-term outcomes are - personal level outcomes and community level outcomes. Both levels of outcomes are examined in relation to the Case Study.However, the cultural policy framework for CCD does not support long-term CCD. It is problematic on many levels - funding, evaluation, and the infrastructure support of CCD. It is asserted that there is urgent need for a re-assessment on the way in which CCD is supported in Australia. And that this assessment examines whether the sector is in fact supportive of the aim of CCD - to effect social change.CCD is a process and an artform underpinned by a social change agenda. This research aims to further develop the academic body of work in the field of CCD, to create new questions, ideas and problems for further research to build upon.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">community cultural development, social change</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.infodiv.unimelb.edu.au/00004319/01/08.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/1776</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Moral development in early childhood</field><field name="creator">Milne,  Rosemary Anne</field><field name="description">This study is of moral development in young children, with a focus on justice as fairness, a term appropriate to the life experience of three- and four-year-old children.

Developed in tandem with a prototype virtual environment interface - termed &#8216;The MaxStage&#8217; - and authored in the Max/MSP software, the thesis uses Rebecca - the musical as a case study to test the efficacy of the model. Rebecca - the musical is in the form of a Broadway-style musical.  Consisting of two Acts, the work is an adaptation of Daphne du Maurier&#8217;s novel of the same name. Whereas the technical art and practice of sound design for large-scale Musicals is increasingly well documented, the art form of sound design as a dramaturgical element in its own right, has received less attention.  Analyses of the r&#244;le of Sound-Designers in the theatre have tended to perpetuate the concept that sound design is commensurate with sound reinforcement.  This tendency, however, delimits the creative potential of sound design to inform and elucidate the drama, as an extension of the musical score.  A potentially more fluid interrelationship between music and sound design is postulated, as observed in the work of Sound-Designers for interactive computer games.  As an electronic form of non-linear theatre, it is argued that new methodologies in adaptive-audio techniques, increasingly evident in computer gaming design, are relevant in defining an invigorated dramaturgy for sound design within the stage theatrical context.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">sound design, Max/MSP, musical theatre, musical theater, Rebecca, The MaxStage</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.infodiv.unimelb.edu.au/00003832/01/Purcell_Thesis_UniMelb.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/1922</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Does size matter? Employment relations in small firms</field><field name="creator">Barrett,  Rowena Joy</field><field name="description">In this thesis an integrated approach to analysing small In this thesis an integrated approach to analysing small firm employment relations is proposed and used to investigate the image of industrial harmony in small firms. This approach accommodates small firm heterogeneity, provides an analytical framework for ordering the effect of a range of factors (not simply size) on employment relations, and incorporates a dialectical relationship between structure and agency. In Chapters 2 and 3 some of the key theoretical and methodological gaps in small firm research, particularly their employment relations, are highlighted. At the conclusion of Chapter 2, it is suggested that an analysis of small firm employment relations must start with the totality of economic and social relations in a particular sector, and its contradictory constituents, rather than the small firm per se. Rainnie&#8217;s (1989) heuristic device, drawing upon Marxist theory of combined and uneven development, is adopted to accommodate small firm heterogeneity. After reviewing studies of small firm industrial relations and human resource management, it is argued, in Chapter 3, that by incorporating the dialectical relationship between structure and agency with a labour process analysis, an explanation for why &#8216;industrial harmony&#8217; appears to typify small firm employment relations can be sought.

In this thesis I used timber harvesting as an experimental treatment to investigate the effect of a changed resource base on the home range and resource selection of the swamp wallaby, Wallabia bicolor.  I recorded habitat attributes at unharvested control, recently harvested (&lt;12 months old), 5 year old and 10 year old sites.  Initially, harvesting removed almost all above-ground plant biomass, although the nitrogen and water content of grass on recently harvested sites was relatively high.  Five years after harvesting, sites were dominated by densely regenerating 1-3 m tall Eucalyptus seedlings.  Relative to unharvested sites, there was substantial lateral cover and values of a forage quality index were high.  In contrast, 10 year old sites supported dense, closed stands of 3-6 m tall eucalypt regeneration, had a moderate amount of lateral cover and had low values of the forage quality index.

The  highest  possible  accuracy  can  only  be achieved if the carrier phase integer ambiguities can be resolved.  In order to resolve the  L1  and  L2  integer  ambiguities  over  long GPS  baselines,  the  double  difference residual  ionospheric  errors must  be  estimated  for  every satellite,  every  epoch.  The resulting number of parameters is usually too large for estimation using ordinary least squares  to  be  practical  due  to  the  time  or  computing  resources  needed  for  the processing.  The  technique  currently  used  to  efficiently  estimate  the  parameters  is known  as  pre-elimination. Pre-elimination  divides  the  unknowns  into  parameters  of interest  (the  coordinates  and  ambiguities)  and  nuisance  parameters  (the  ionospheric path delays). The nuisance parameters are treated as stochastic variables and modelled as  process  noise,  avoiding  the  need  for  them  to  be  explicitly  estimated. Whilst  this approach  is highly efficient,  it makes assumptions about  the  stochastic behaviour of the residual ionospheric error that are not necessarily valid. The effectiveness of preelimination  can  be  increased  through  the  use  of  a  deterministic  model  of  the ionosphere. It is the hypothesis of this research that the ionospheric error can be more effectively  estimated  than  is  possible with  pre-elimination,  leading  to more  reliable ambiguity resolution for long baseline precise positioning.

Gurindji Kriol is spoken by the Gurindji people in northern Australia. It fuses Gurindji, which is a member of the Ngumpin-Yapa subgroup of the Pama-Nyungan family, with Kriol, which is an English-lexifier creole spoken across the north of Australia. Gurindji Kriol exhibits a structural split between the NP and VP systems, but is lexically quite mixed. Kriol provides much of the verbal grammar including tense and mood auxiliaries, and transitive, aspect and derivational morphology. Most of the NP structure is of Gurindji origin including case and derivational morphology. Lexically, nominals and verbs are derived from both source languages. In form, the various sub-systems of Gurindji Kriol bear a close resemblance to their source languages. However contact and competition between Gurindji and Kriol in the process of the formation of the mixed language has altered the function and distribution of these systems, including the Gurindji-derived case morphology. The aim of this thesis is three-fold: (i) to provide the first detailed socio-historical and grammatical description of Gurindji Kriol (&#167;2 and &#167;A1), (ii) to propose a path by which Gurindji case morphology was incorporated into the Gurindji Kriol clause (&#167;3-&#167;5), and (iii) to demonstrate changes in the use of four case markers quantitatively (&#167;6-&#167;9).</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Gurindji Kriol, Gurindji, Kriol, Australian language, mixed language, case-marking, case morphology, language contact, creole, contact language</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.infodiv.unimelb.edu.au/00003898/01/Meakins_2007.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/1997</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Colonial integration and the maintenance of colony form in encrusting bryozoans</field><field name="creator">Bone,  Elisa K</field><field name="description">The form of an organism is often closely linked to its function, and this relationship may be particularly important in organisms where individual form is highly flexible due to the repeated iteration of minute multicellular modules. In many modular taxa, including the bryozoans discussed in this thesis, each module is able to function as largely independent units; an individual module can feed independently, has a separate gut, and has the potential to reproduce. These characteristics mean that the number of modules in a bryozoan colony, and hence its size, is a reasonably accurate measure of the colony&#8217;s ability to both capture resources and to produce sexually developed larvae. Size is therefore a more appropriate measure of colony demography than age, the criterion traditionally used for unitary organisms. However, processes that can complicate the demography of modular organisms such as colony damage, fission or fusion also mean that the age structure of the component modules in a colony or fragment remains an important predictor of colony functioning, interacting with the effects of colony size.

They contribute to innate immunity by secreting a range of pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. TNF and IL-6) upon activation as well as by phagocytosing pathogens and dead cells, which is necessary for the resolution of inflammation and effective wound repair.  Macrophages also contribute to adaptive immunity by functioning as antigen presenting cells.Colony stimulating factor 1 (CSF-1) is the major growth factor governing the differentiation, proliferation and survival of macrophages. Although not as well appreciated, CSF-1 also regulates some of the immune functions of macrophages, such as cytokine secretion and phagocytosis.  However, the mechanisms by which CSF-1 governs the immune functions of macrophages are poorly understood.  Cytokine secretion, phagocytosis and antigen presentation involve various vesicle trafficking and membrane fusion events, processes in which SNARE proteins play vital roles.  Thus, the hypothesis tested in this thesis was that CSF-1 modulates the immune functions of macrophages by regulating the expression and/or activity of SNARE proteins that regulate endocytic and exocytic processes.In this study, the endosomal SNARE protein syntaxin 7 was identified, via microarray analysis, as a CSF-1 inducible gene in primary mouse macrophages. Syntaxin 7 has previously been detected in phagosomal membranes in macrophages. Furthermore, syntaxin 7 has recently been implicated in the secretion of cytokines (e.g. TNF) from macrophages by forming a novel complex with syntaxin 6, Vti1b and VAMP3.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">SNARE, syntaxin 7, macrophages, CSF-1, phosphorylation</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.infodiv.unimelb.edu.au/00004076/01/Thesis_Achuthan.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/2327</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Star formation and galaxy evolution of the Local Universe based on HIPASS</field><field name="creator">Wong,  Oiwei Ivy</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates the star formation and galaxy evolution of the nearby Local Volume based on Neutral Hydrogen (HI) studies.

HIPASS is an HI survey of the entire Southern sky up to a declination of +25.5 degrees (including the Northern extension) using the Parkes 64-metre radio telescope. I have also produced a catalogue of the optical counterparts corresponding to the galaxies found in Northern HIPASS. From this optical catalogue, we also conclude that we did not find any isolated dark galaxies. The other half of my thesis consists of work with the SINGG and SUNGG projects.

Various interpretations of the term, &#8216;distributed leadership&#8217; are described in the literature:  Distributed leadership is presented by some writers as another version of team leadership, shared leadership, democratic leadership and the like. Other writers describe distributed leadership as normative practice &#8211; as the way leadership ought to be enacted. The term, &#8216;distributed leadership&#8217;, as used in this thesis, refers to a dualistic, two-dimensional explanation of organisational life. Here, a naturalistic, causal-computational view of organisational action stands alongside a phenomenological, qualitative view of the essence of leadership. Whist the former may offer a universal, third-person view of organisational functioning; the viewpoint presented by the latter offers distinctive, first-person experiences of leadership.  Although correctly emphasising the role of environment and culture in leadership as distributed, it is argued here that distributed leadership shares the theoretical and epistemological problems of all leadership theories and lacks explanatory power.  This conclusion is reached by means of a naturalistic coherentist theory of knowledge, which recognises the theory-dependence of empirical data. Coherence is adjudicated according to the superempirical virtues of conservatism, simplicity, consistency, comprehensiveness, fecundity, explanatory unity, refutability, and learnability.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/2463</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/2463</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Stories of significance: an investigation into the construction of social meaning in young people&#8217;s dramatised stories</field><field name="creator">Kelman, David Robin</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the relationship between narrative and meaning in young people&#8217;s dramatised stories and how social meaning is generated in community performance.

It looks at the impact of Victoria's specialist counter terrorist squad, the Special Operations Group (SOG), on policing in Victoria and asks whether the group has led to the development of a more 'military based' approach to policing. The research demonstrates that the SOG has been the harbinger of more military styles of policing involving high levels of confrontation, more lethal weapons and a greater range of weapons and more frequent recourse to deadly force. The establishment of groups like the SOG has also undermined Australia's democratic traditions by blurring the boundaries between the police and military and weakening the safeguards which have in then past prevented military force being used against citizens.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">blue army, Victoria police, Australia, Special Operations Group (SOG), law enforcement, 1970's, Victoria Police Protective Security Group</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.infodiv.unimelb.edu.au/00000661/04/661complete.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/2865</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Non-phage Inhibition Of Cheese Starter Lactococci.</field><field name="creator">Packham,  Wayne</field><field name="description">Modern, large scale Cheddar cheese manufacture is dependent on reliable acid production by Lactococcus lactis subspecies cremoris and subspecies lactis starter cultures.

Soil, due to its large thermal capacity and inertia, can serve as a heat source or sink, thus offering relatively constant operation conditions for a heat pump. The soil temperature at a depth of about 2.0m fluctuates slightly around the yearly average air temperature at any given location. This offers a lower and stable sink temperature in the cooling mode operation and a higher and stable source temperature in the heating mode operation.

To investigate the role both of ethnic identification and its interplay with institutional factors, a comparative analysis of secondary student experiences in two national settings was undertaken. The case of Turkish-background students in Australia and France suggests that the influences of ethnic identity are thoroughly transformed from one setting to the other by distinctive pedagogical structures. Streaming and severe academic judgement in France lower academic self-esteem, while creating resentment and social distance between students and teachers. By contrast, the deferral of selection and judgement in Australia allows, temporarily, for a more convivial classroom atmosphere, but fails just as surely to successfully navigate students through the curriculum and achieve academic success. The accommodations of both systems to students in &#8216;peripheral&#8217; locations constitute logics of marginal integration which enable and legitimise &#8216;exclusion from within&#8217;. Student efforts to make meaning of school life through peer cultures which share many similarities across institutional and national boundaries emerge as what I have called strategies of marginal integration. Ethnic-minority students appear to be particularly susceptible to those logics and strategies, which reinforce their position within the system as marginal.

The study was situated in the context of the current reform effort in adapting Realistic Mathematics Education (RME) theory and looked into the role and issues of incorporating RME tenets into the design of activities for teacher education in Indonesia. The study was carried out in two cycles of teaching experiments involving 258 preservice primary and secondary teachers in one particular teacher training institute in Indonesia using Design Research methodology. After the first cycle of 4 lessons, activities and test items were refined for trialling with a new cohort in the following year. Findings from the two cycles signified the importance of revisiting and improving pre-service teachers&#8217; content and pedagogical content knowledge of decimals. This study found that pre-service teachers&#8217; knowledge on decimals were characterised as fragmented, with strong reliance on rules without understanding, and strong association with fractions. Pre-service teachers in both cycles made substantial improvement in both content and pedagogical content knowledge and they gained their first experiences of working with physical models and working in groups with class discussion.

Nowadays, cultural training is a core component in many second language curricula designs. In the case of Foreign Language (FL) education, the place of Foreign Culture (FC) has been minimised in two key areas: policy and practice. First, researchers have found that teachers often lack a profound understanding of the place of FC in EFL teaching. Secondly, EFL is also influenced by global factors, and the place of FC is often not substantiated in language teacher education policy. Accordingly, previous research suggests the need to investigate the place of FC in pre-service EFL teacher education for potential integration, especially within mono-cultural, conservative contexts.The aim of this doctoral thesis is to develop concepts relevant to the integration of FC into pre-service EFL teacher education. To achieve this, a qualitative case study of the pre-service EFL teacher education at selected Saudi Teachers Colleges has been conducted. Data has been gathered through document analysis and classroom observation. Further, interviews with the stakeholders including policymakers, academic EFL instructors and pre-service EFL teachers themselves have been conducted. Qualitative data analysis techniques have followed inductive, cyclical approaches and self-reflection with a focus on the current surrounding conditions of the place of FC in policy and practice.

Events leading to the current state of Israeli society will be traced in order to illustrate the way in which change occurs. The shifts in Israeli history and society during these decades will be examined alongside developments in Israeli literature. Accordingly, eight works of fiction have been selected to lie at the heart of the study. These works, all of which centre around the Israeli military experience, convey an erosion of personal, national, and ideological certainties. The analysis of these works demands three areas of exploration: the depiction of the soldier in the civilian setting, the depiction of the soldier as he interacts with other soldiers in the military sphere, and &#8216;post-Zionist&#8217; military fiction produced in recent decades. These three areas of exploration entail an interrogation of gender, nationalism, and &#8216;post-Zionism&#8217; in contemporary Israel. The works examined in the third chapter contain commentary not only upon the social reality of their authors, but also upon the way in which Israeli literature engages with the issues that inform its existence.

But the question is, should we allow philosopical arguments about science education's social foundations, for example the possibility of knowledge, capture us too much?  It is my contention that simplicity in meta-theoretical issues is a good strategy.  If a simple platform for science teaching and research could be formulated and accepted, more time and energy could be devoted to the main objectives of the discipline to do with explanations of the development and impact of science in society. Because of their connotations and general vagueness, both positivism and ultra-relativism in social constructivism tend to necessitate years of cumbersome philosophical studies.  Realism does not have these implications.  "Realism" was employed to signify ontological assumptions; in particular the epistemological position that we have provides at least partial access to social reality, emabling valid but fallible knowledge about it.  "Causal" in causal realism is employed to suggest a general orientation in science education research - to explain by identifying generative mechanisms.  The concepts of mechanism, causality, and explanation must be recaptured from the positivistic tradition.  In particular, they must be tied to ontology, not simply epistemology.In the second section I examined the ongoing debate between "cognitive" and "situated learning" teaching approaches, in terms of methodilogical individualism, holism, and micro- and macro-sociology.  By way of the natural sciences, I suggested a way out of these dilemmas is simply to start with accepting that what is happening in science.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">science, study and teaching.</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.infodiv.unimelb.edu.au/00002048/01/Cross.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/413</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Performance of steel framed domestic structures subjected to earthquake loads</field><field name="creator">Barton, Andrew David</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates the performance of cold formed steel framed domestic structures subjected to earthquake loads. These structures generally include one and two storey houses, comprising steel wall framing, exterior veneer cladding and internal lining. The dynamic, non-linear performance of such structures during earthquakes is simplified to static linear behaviour for design purposes using the structural response modification factor, R&#181;. This factor is defined as the product of the structural ductility reduction factor, R&#181;, and the over-strength of the system, &#937;. This thesis develops a rigorous technique for the determination of R&#181; and the application of this technique is demonstrated for a proprietary framing system. This is achieved using novel non-linear, transient dynamic finite element models of these structures subjected to earthquake loads. The model parameters are estimated from unique experiments conducted on representative structures using a shaking table. It is shown that the framing system considered is non-ductile (ie R&#181;&#8776;1). This result directly contradicts the assumed ductile behaviour of these framing systems as specified in the Australian earthquake loading standard, AS 1170.4. The significance of this is that current design practices are unconservative and therefore underestimate the earthquake loads on these structures.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">building, iron and steel, Australia, earthquake engineering, earthquake resistant design</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/2362</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/2362</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Random graph processes and optimisation</field><field name="creator">Cain, Julie A</field><field name="description">Random graph processes are most often used to investigate theoretical questions about random graphs.  A randomised algorithm can be defined specifically for the purpose of finding some structure in a graph, such as a matching, a colouring or a particular kind of sub graph.  Properties of the related random graph process then suggest properties, or bounds on properties, of the structure.  In this thesis, we use a random graph process to analyse a particular load balancing algorithm from theoretical computer science.  By doing so, we demonstrate that random graph processes may also be used to  analyse other algorithms and systems of a random nature, from areas such as computer science, telecommunications and other areas of engineering and mathematics.  Moreover, this approach can lead to theoretical results on the performance of algorithms that are difficult to obtain by other methods.

The study was initiated by Dr Cynthia Maung, a Burmese medical doctor, herself a stateless person who coordinates a refugee-led primary health service five kilometres inside Thailand.  Unsafe abortion is a common problem and much time and resources are taken with the care of women suffering haemorrhage, infection and pain after self-induced abortion in both Thai and Burmese-led health facilities.  The thesis examines the characteristics of Burmese women admitted to health facilities with post-abortion complications and their chosen methods of self-induced abortion.  Local meanings of abortion and post-abortion care are explored.  Lay midwives play a central role in fertility management and some are abortionists.  Men&#8217;s role in the management of fertility is also presented.  The women are generally married with children.  Considered illegal migrants, they are employed and work in Thailand without work permits.  Many women have a history of escaping human rights abuses and entrenched poverty in Burma.  At least a third of women admitted into care with post-abortion complications had induced their abortion with oral herbal preparations, pummelling manipulations or stick abortions.  Most of the abortion services were provided by Burmese lay midwives.  Reasons for terminating the pregnancy include: poverty, gender-based violence and the local illness of &#8216;weakness&#8217;.  In addition, low sexual health knowledge, and difficult access to reproductive health services play a part in mistimed pregnancy.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">forced migration, refugee, reproductive health, unwanted pregnancy, abortion, Burma, Thailand, Myanmar, traditional birth attendant</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.infodiv.unimelb.edu.au/00001542/01/ThesisFinalfixed.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/469</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Heroin importation and higher level drug dealing in Australia: opportunistic entrepreneurialism</field><field name="creator">Beyer,  Lorraine Rose</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates the behavioural and interactive elements of heroin importation behaviour. Almost all heroin consumed in Australia is imported. Thus the people who conduct the importing and their behavioural characteristics are an important point of focus. The thesis argues too little is known of illegal drug importation and higher level drug deal offending beyond stereotypes and that the lack of publicly available, independent research means there is ill-informed public and political debate and a very narrow evidence-base on which policy and strategy can be based. Review of available literature led to identification of a number of gaps in knowledge about heroin imporation offending and these provided a framework for the focus of investigations. The thesis uses data triangulation to increase the validity of the findings. The findings are based on agency data and semi-structured interviews with informants in Australia, Thailand and Hong Kong. The characteristics of offenders detected importing heavy weights of heroin are contrasted with those importing lighter weights. A number of understandings arise from the findings including some that are supported by other research. As well there are a number of new findings which challenge current concepts and stereotypes and have implications for policy and strategy aimed at supply reduction.

The problem of sexual aggression is multi-dimensional and accordingly a comprehensive assessment needs to address a wide range of psychological vulnerabilities and offence process characteristics to enhance treatment customisation. The purpose of this study was to create a clinician rated measure for the treatment classification of rapists &#8211; Checklist of Offence Pathways &#8211; Rapist Version - and to assess the measure&#8217;s reliability and validity. The 15-item measure was created using the framework of the pathways model (Ward &amp; Hudson, 1998; Ward, Hudson, &amp; Keenan, 1998).  The measure was divided into two subscales measuring approach vs. avoidant goals and active vs. passive strategies. Both subscales demonstrated significant interrater reliability (r = .53 and r = .46, respectively) as well as internal consistency (a = .50 and a = .60, respectively). The majority (80%) of the inter-item correlations were uncorrelated or weak indicating that the test items were measuring separate constructs. Validity analysis indicated that a number of test items displayed convergent and discriminant validity with established psychometric scales. Overall these results suggest that this measure provides a useful framework for understanding sexual aggression and selecting treatment strategies for rapists, while avoiding some of the pitfalls associated with dissimulation in self-report measures.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">rapist, sexual offender, psychometric measure, treatment</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.infodiv.unimelb.edu.au/00002296/01/Q_Hussain_Thesis_251205.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/706</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The chemistry of Salvia divinorum</field><field name="creator">Munro, Thomas Anthony</field><field name="description">Salvia divinorum is a hallucinogenic sage used to treat illness by the Mazatec Indians of Mexico. Salvinorin A (1a), a neoclerodane diterpenoid isolated from the plant, is a potent, selective agonist at the kappa opioid receptor (KOR), and is the first non-nitrogenous opioid. The plant is used recreationally as a hallucinogen, but is unpopular due to its dysphoric effects. 1a has been prohibited in Australia under an invalid systematic name. An early report of psychoactive alkaloids in S. divinorum proved to be irreproducible. Similarly, tests in mice suggesting the presence of psychoactive compounds other than 1a were confounded and therefore unreliable. In this work, an improved isolation method for 1a was developed, using filtration through activated carbon to decolourise the crude extract. Six new diterpenoids were isolated: salvinorins D&#8211;F (1d&#8211;1f) and divinatorins A&#8211;C (28a&#8211;28c). Five known terpenoids not previously reported from this species were also isolated. The structure&#8211;activity relationships of 1a were evaluated via selective modifications of each functional group. Useful synthetic methods are reviewed, including the first thorough review of furanolactone hydrogenations. Testing of the derivatives at the KOR suggests that the methyl ester and furan ring of 1a are required for activity, but that the lactone and ketone functionalities are not. Other compounds from S. divinorum did not bind to the KOR, suggesting that 1a is the plant&#8217;s active principle.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Salvia divinorum, salvinorin, divinatorin, terpenoid, neoclerodane diterpenoid, alkaloid, Valdes, Diaz, epimerization, kappa opioid receptor, HIV, activated carbon, amorphous solid, legal status, systematic name</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.infodiv.unimelb.edu.au/00002327/01/Munro2006thesis.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/742</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Foreign Direct Investment in Australia: determinants and consequences</field><field name="creator">Faeth, Isabel</field><field name="description">Increased globalisation over the last two decades has led to strong growth of international business activity and FDI.

Not only has Australia received a large amount of foreign investment so far, it is also competing for more FDI. Invest Australia, Australia&#8217;s national inward investment agency, is actively promoting Australia as a location for FDI, claiming that foreign investment has made a major contribution to Australia&#8217;s economic growth and living standards of all Australians.

This thesis examines the evolution of a secondary technical school until its demise under the 1982 to 1989 State Labor Government. The technical schools were under threat from their inception following the 1910 Education Act. The first Chief Inspector of Technical Instruction, Donald Clark, warned that their executive school councils and their links with the senior technical colleges were bulwarks against their extinction. Clark argued that there was a need for strong leadership and vigilance if they were to retain their distinctive philosophy. The wording of the 1910 Education Act did not specify the development of a dual system. Yet the tech schools flourished because they were popular with boys and parents, because of their executive Councils, and because of their relationship with industry. The junior techs evolved into secondary techs during the 1950s and 60s, staffed by teachers with industrial experience who were qualified to teach apprentices, as well as the junior students. A Board of Inspectors of Technical Schools travelled throughout Victoria to disseminate information and mentor technical school staff. DTE Ted Jackson&#8217;s 1970 policy gave principals unprecedented autonomy to respond to the needs of young people within their local community.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Shepparton South Technical School, secondary technical education, boys education in Victoria</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.infodiv.unimelb.edu.au/00001070/01/Prestonfinalthesis.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/1096</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Genetic manipulation of type D Pasteurella multocida for vaccine development</field><field name="creator">Wright, Catherine Louise</field><field name="description">Progressive Atrophic Rhinitis (PAR) is a serious complex disease of young swine characterized by sneezing, atrophy of the nasal turbinates, shortening and twisting of the snout and reduction in weight gain. Although the aetiology of the disease is complex, infection with the bacterium toxigenic Pateurella multocida, is considered essential. A dermonecrotic toxin (DNT) produced by toxigenic strains of type D P. multocida is central to the resorption of the nasal bone structures characteristic of the infection. The P. multocida DNT gene toxA has been previously cloned, sequenced and genetically manipulated in order to develop a vaccine for PAR. These earlier studies demonstrated that DNT-specific antibodies produced in pigs by vaccination with the purified genetically inactivated DNT derivative (toxoid) resulted in the protection of the animals against experimentally induced PAR. An alternative approach to using a subunit vaccine for PAR is to express the toxoided gene from P. multocida either from the chromosome or a plasmid thus providing a live vaccine that could present to the porcine immune system a full spectrum of bacterial antigens in addition to the DNT.

One way to maximise the amount of information that is being used in the process is to use metadata engines. Metadata engines can be used to create virtual databases which are a collection of individual datasets located over a network. Virtual databases allow decisions to be made using data from many different data bases at many different locations on a network. They shield the user from this fact. From the users point of view they are only using data from the one location. This thesis investigates some of the concepts behind metadata engines for Internet based Spatial Data Infrastructures. The thesis has a particular emphasis on how metadata engines can be used to create virtual databases that could be of use in the planning and decision making processes. The thesis also investigates some current spatial data technologies such as SDIs, data warehouses, data marts and clearing houses, their interoperability and their relationship to metadata engines. It also explores some of the more recent spatial data applications that have been developed in the context of metadata engines and Spatial Data Infrastructures.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">metatdata, spatial database, SDI, spatial data infrastructure</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.infodiv.unimelb.edu.au/00001052/01/andrew_thesis.zip</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/1190</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Teaching the nation: politics and pedagogy in Australian history</field><field name="creator">Clark, Anna</field><field name="description">There is considerable anxiety about teaching Australian history in schools.

The researcher believed that music and sound editing was under-used in schools and that children could: -work successfully with that type of software -work creatively with the software -benefit from its use. A small case study was used to expose the participants (eight children from Grades 3-6) to two professional level music software applications: Cakewalk Pro Audio 9 and Cool Edit 2000. The children explored the software and completed set tasks over a ten-week period. Data, in the form of the students&#8217; work, taped copies of all sessions, interviews and  researcher reflections, were analysed to present an understanding of the creative and compositional processes and products. In addition, all student pieces were recorded onto CD. The analysis of data suggests competent use of both software applications as well as satisfactory completion of set tasks. The data also indicate that the participants were able to operate at compositional levels beyond their age and musical skills and knowledge. Conclusions are drawn to suggest that, in this case, the use of this software has assisted the creative process and has allowed these children the opportunity to compose and construct pieces that could not have been constructed without the software.

Nonetheless, despite the development since the 1950's of extensive government provision, the growth of large church-sponsored agencies, and the advent of secular community services, there is reason to believe the trend for congregational involvement persists. However, there is also reason to believe that provision of services by congregations is not well understood, an issue of more significance in view of recent policy shifts, especially in the US and UK, promoting an increasing emphasis on government support for welfare service delivery by these &#8220;pervasively sectarian&#8221; groups. Within the Australian setting little is known about the contribution of local religious congregations to the provision of local community services, although limited data from the 1996 National Church Life Survey indicates in excess of 65% of congregations claim some local community involvement.

Although the production of these woodblock printed images virtually ceased early this century, the relevance of this art form in contemporary China has continued.  The New Year Picture is often hailed as a prototype for modern forms of visual expression.  A renewed interest in this old art form has also prompted widespread conservation of the New Year Picture at the same time as making it the subject of scholarly pursuit.  This study evaluates the relevance of New Year Pictures to contemporary art and society by focussing on prints produced in the period spanning the century from 1842 to 1942.  This period is definitive of the changes that occurred within the popular art form.  The year 1842 marks the end of the Opium War with Britain and the signing of the Treaty of Nanjing, permanently changing China&#8217;s international relationships.  This, in turn, impacted greatly upon Chinese society and culture.  The 1942 was the year of Mao&#8217;s &#8220;Talks at the Yan&#8217;an Conference on Literature and Art&#8221;.  In mapping out strategies for artists to participate in the communist transformation of Chinese society, the &#8220;Talks&#8221; articulated an approach to Chinese art and culture that would permanently alter the way in which artistic traditions were to be utilised, both in a practical way and in the sense of how the past was to be perceived.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">New Year cards in China, New Year decorations in China, Chinese colour prints in Ming-Qing dynasties, 1368-1912, Chinese colour prints in 20th century</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/2827</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/2827</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The impact of the National Training Reform Agenda and workplace rearrangement on staff development in Australian academic and state libraries</field><field name="creator">Bridgland, Angela C.</field><field name="description">In Australia, the combination of a changing workforce profile, the changing nature of work and industrial agreements and the changing role of education and training gave rise to the National Training Reform Agenda (NTRA).

Among various methods that could be employed to generate and study odd-electron biomolecules in the gas phase, redox processes involving metal ions and homolytic cleavage of metallated amino acid or peptide derivatives would be attractive from a chemical perspective since, in principle, a wide range of metals and biomolecules or biomolecule derivatives could be explored.

In July and August 1898 he published a book of poems and gave a public address, which, together, led to demands for his dismissal. The outcry against him came largely from a section of the community which Matthew Arnold, some thirty years earlier in England, had identified as Hebraic. The radical contrast between, on the one hand, the underlying assumptions of this group, particularly its epistemology and axiology and, on the other, the Hellenic, Existentialist axioms that informed Marshall-Hall&#8217;s thinking, created a situation which was structurally conducive to the hostile outbreak of collective action that occurred. This structural conductiveness was reinforced by a number of elements of strain - a belief in the debased character of the times; a pervasive Manicheanism; various misunderstandings in regard to Marshall-Hall&#8217;s views, deriving from the unsystematic and frequently allegorical manner of their exposition; and contemporary perceptions of his role as a university teacher, and of the tone in which his outbursts were couched (itself the outcome of a blend of conscious beliefs and unconscious motivation).

The field of psychology offers a different, yet complementary, approach to the topic of economic forecasting. The aim of the current study was to research mental processes and behaviours of individuals participating in a forecasting task. The role of the following psychological variables within economic prediction behaviour was assessed: (1) task complexity, (2) decision making style, (3) the anchoring and adjustment heuristic, (4) the framing effect, and (5) personal feelings about the task content. All of these variables were hypothesised to have a direct influence on prediction behaviour.

This study is a critical reflection on moves to change curriculum, curriculum policy framework initiatives and the institutional contexts that shape the impact and implementation of curriculum. Public curriculum policy formation is challenged by competing pressures and limitations including an increasing emphasis on &#8216;partnerships&#8217; and &#8216;networking&#8217;. There are difficulties and complex challenges to ensure that all students share in the benefits.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">music, students with disabilities, music in education, curriculum planning, school integration</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.infodiv.unimelb.edu.au/00003803/01/Helen_(2).pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/1597</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Controllable few state quantum systems for information processing</field><field name="creator">Cole, Jared H.</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates several different aspects of the physics of few state quantum systems and their use in information processing applications.

Despite extensive research that has been conducted on various aspects of geopolymerisation, especially in enhancing the properties of resultant binders and understanding the chemical mechanisms involved, a number of questions remain to be answered. The role of calcium in geopolymerisation is one of them. It is known that the presence of a moderate amount of calcium in a geopolymeric binder will improve the resultant compressive strength. However, it is still unclear whether calcium will play a charge-balancing role within the aluminosilicate structure (to maintain electro-neutrality in a similar way as alkali metal cations, Na+ or K+, or perhaps an alternative role). In addition, the role of calcium in geopolymerisation is of great interest because it is proposed for the first time that calcium links geopolymer chemistry to, and distinguishes it from, ordinary Portland cement (OPC).

In commonly used PCA systems, patients use a hand-held push-button to indicate the presence of pain and initiate a predetermined bolus of drug infusion. A disadvantage of this system is that no means is provided to accommodate variations in the intensity of pain or the sensitivity of the patient to the analgesic in use apart from the frequency of button pushing. A fixed rate background infusion is usually an option. A new adaptive PCA system is proposed to provide improved PCA through the use a variable background infusion, the provision for an extended high range of analgesic dosages and a novel handset which allows patients to rate their pain. The total system is under the control of an expert algorithm and is proposed to overcome some of the shortcomings of current systems.

It focuses on the effects of the so-called non-structural components, namely, plasterboard lining and brick veneer cladding. An extensive testing program was conducted on a full scale one-room-house measuring 2.3m x 2.4m x 2.4m high. This house was tested at various stages of construction to assess the contribution of the various components. Different types of loading, including non-destructive swept sine wave, destructive pseudo-static cyclic racking and simulated earthquakes were employed to obtain the various characteristics of the structure. The testing program on the test house was complemented by further tests on critical components such as brick ties and plasterboard connections. Detailed analytical models were developed and verified against the experimental results. These models were then used to conduct a sensitivity analysis to study other configurations, identify critical parameters and develop design guidelines. The experimental and analytical results have shown that the plasterboard wall lining can provide lateral bracing to domestic wall frames since they effectively act as shear walls. The performance of wall lining is greatly enhanced when set corner joints, ceiling cornices and skirting boards are considered. The capacity is increased by more than three times when these extra components are taken into account. Plasterboard also exhibits high damping and energy absorption capacity which are beneficial under earthquake loading. Furthermore, the strength and stiffness contributions of plasterboard lining and strap cross braces are additive.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">earthquake effects on brick houses,steel framing in building</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.infodiv.unimelb.edu.au/00003001/01/Gad._E.F..pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/1718</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Superfluid spherical Couette flow and rotational irregularities in pulsars</field><field name="creator">Peralta, Carlos Andres</field><field name="description">Small amplitude rotational irregularities are observed in a number of rotation-powered pulsars.

Both classes of irregularity seem to arise from some mechanism that couples the angular momentum of the solid crust and superfluid core of the star, which is activated suddenly when differential rotation exceeds a threshold. Coupling mechanisms proposed to date include catastrophic vortex unpinning in the inner crust, triggered by starquakes; vortex creep, due to thermally activated quantum tunnelling; superfluid-superconductor interactions in the core; and superfluid instabilities.

A peer-to-peer shared ride system allows a client to find rides in an ad-hoc manner, by negotiating directly with nearby hosts via radio-based communication. Such a peer-to-peer shared ride system has to deal with various types of hosts, such as private cars, taxicabs and mass transit vehicles. Agents, i.e. a client and hosts, have diverse behaviors in such systems. Their different behaviors affect the negotiation process, and consequently the travel choices. Preliminary research (Winter et al. 2005) has investigated peer-to-peer shared ride systems with homogeneous hosts and immobile client. This thesis extends their work to multiple types of agents. It focuses on what are typical agent behaviors in peer-to-peer shared ride systems, and how these behaviors affect negotiation processes in a dynamic transport environment.

INSL3 is also known as Leydig insulin-like hormone and the relaxin-like factor, and is produced by the Leydig cells in the testis, the thecal and luteal cells of the ovary, the thyroid, placenta and mammary gland. INSL3 induces transabdominal testicular descent by stimulating the development of the gubernacular ligament, which subsequently swells and contracts to pull the fetal testes towards the inguinal wall.

The advent of IVF and the rapid growth of reproductive technologies have challenged the significance historically associated with biological relationships. It is now possible for a child to have many different people in the role of genetic, gestational, nurturing or legal parent and for the formation of many novel types of families. While frequently some or all of these roles are combined, it is now possible for someone to be a &#8216;parent&#8217; in one sense, without necessarily taking on the obligations and rights associated with parenthood in a moral sense. Despite the expanded options for constructing families and the proliferation of novel arrangements for raising children, the essential feature of what it means to be a &#8216;real parent&#8217; and to have a child of &#8216;one&#8217;s own&#8217; is often grounded in the transmission of genes. This thesis examines the claim that genes define &#8216;moral&#8217; parenthood. It investigates whether or not genetic relatedness is morally weighty in determining which individuals incur obligations for and rights over children. My thesis adopts a novel approach to address this question. It combines the analysis of both people&#8217;s views as captured through a qualitative study and those found in philosophical literature relating to the moral significance of genetic parenthood. I design and conduct a study to capture more directly the meanings that people attach to passing on their genes, which acts as a starting point for identifying and evaluating possible arguments about the moral relevance of genetic parenthood.

Consequently, this thesis examines the conditions under which investigative partnership policing of e-crime at the state police level can be mutually beneficial to police and the private sectors, while maintaining public interests. The thesis aims, therefore, to establish normative standards and guidelines for configuring effective and ethical public-private partnerships for e-crime investigation. An exploratory analysis of 3529 e-crime incidents, reported to and cleared by Victoria Police during 1999/00 to 2003/04, investigated the nature of reported e-crime, routine factors affecting its successful investigation and whether partnership was one of those factors. A pilot survey canvassed private sector responses to these issues and partnered e-crime investigation. Thirty-seven interviews were conducted with police, private investigators and e-crime victims.

A multiplicity of systems for pasture mating are presently in use. Bulls are mated singly or in groups, they are set-stocked during the mating period or rotated about the different groups of cows, they are mated at the rate of 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 bulls per 100 cows, young bulls are mated to cows in company with old bulls or other young bulls (Dickson 1966). There is little scientific basis for any of these mating systems since basic information on the sexual and social behaviour of beef bulls at pasture is lacking.

Although there are many high-profile crises that have been managed successfully by applying strategies to make organisations more resilient, there is still considerable confusion and uncertainty about the way these crises have been evaluated and the way their success can be measured in relation to other crises.There are no international crisis-preparedness standards in relation to a set of crisis outcomes indicators that could be applied. This lack of empirically proven relationships between crisis-preparedness strategies and their effect on crisis outcomes makes the identification of effective strategies very difficult. Case studies, anecdotal evidence and a limited number of empirical crisis management studies (i.e. effect on share price) suggest a great variability in the effectiveness of certain strategies and practices that have produced inconclusive results. This study analyses the strategies variability to advance knowledge in the field of crisis management.

Universities enrol mature age students on the basis of, for example, their equity background, prior learning, work experiences, scores on a mature age entrance test, or results in an alternative entry program. This study examined the nature and outcomes of four alternative entry programs (AEPs) to higher education for mature age learners (21 years plus). Alternative entry programs provide mature age students with a way to explore their academic aptitude for, and confidence to, study. Prior to this research there was a lack of knowledge regarding the characteristics and outcomes of AEPs for mature age students. In addition, there was no study that examined a series of AEPs to show the relationship between AEP characteristics and learner outcomes. The inquiry addresses this shortfall. The project takes a qualitative case study approach. It provides a way of understanding the uniqueness, particularities and complexities of four AEPs for Australian resident mature age learners.

The focus is qubit read-out and robust two-qubit control of the exchange interaction in the presence of both systematic and environmental errors.  We develop a theoretical model of the doubly occupied D- read-out state found in Si:P based nuclear spin architectures.  We test our theory by using it to determine the binding energy of the D- state, comparing to known results.  Our model can be used in detailed calculations of the adiabatic read-out protocol proposed for these devices.  Regarding this protocol, preliminary calculations suggest the small binding energy of the doubly occupied read-out state will result in a state dwell-time less than that required for measurement using a single electron transistor (SET).  We propose and analyse an alternative approach to single-spin read-out using optically induced spin to charge transduction, showing that the top gate biases required for qubit selection are significantly less than those demanded by the adiabatic scheme, thereby increasing the D+D- lifetime.  Implications for singlet-triplet discrimination for electron spin qubits are also discussed.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">quantum computing, read-out, composite pulses, charge fluctuators</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/2805</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Asian scopic modernities: alternative visibilities of transnational Chinese masculinity in global cinema</field><field name="creator">Koh, Alvin Kok-yong</field><field name="description">This thesis examines transnational Chinese masculinity as the articulation of Asian scopic modernities in contemporary Hong Kong, Hollywood and mainland Chinese films.

This thesis investigates significant cinematic events that contribute to these new conditions of visibility: the popularity of Hong Kong actors Leslie Cheung and Tony Leung who embody marginalised paradigms of masculinity in Asia; the crossovers of Hong Kong stars into Hollywood; and the advent of Zhang Yimou's alternative blockbuster films and Quentin Tarantino's trans-Asian films.

Critical to the study is an initial outline of a local tradition of condoned eclecticism in 1930s domestic architecture and the presence of an evolving housing stock that was mixed rather than predominantly that of the single family house. Modernism in 1930s Melbourne architecture is found to be part of a compositional tradition rather than emerging from ideological imperatives. Robin Boyd&#8217;s idea of a so-called Victorian Type is also found to be part of this compositional tradition. The study then examines the suppressive effect of World War 2 on this tradition and its eventual re-emergence during the ensuing three decades.The circumstances which encouraged the adoption of the language of modern architecture and its subsequent effects are examined via prevailing architectural themes. These include: the post-war Victorian Type; structural experiment; geometry; the influence of the East Coast Bauhaus and Frank Lloyd Wright; the continuing idiosyncratic assimilation and reformulation process (albeit under the guise of the Modern Movement) which described the modern house in Melbourne of the 1950s and 1960s; the renewed interest in texture, exposed materials and compartmented planning in the 1960s; and the eventual re-emergence of artifice in the composition of space, form and detail and a renewed variety and intricacy in choice of texture and materials.

Events leading to the current state of Israeli society will be traced in order to illustrate the way in which change occurs. The shifts in Israeli history and society during these decades will be examined alongside developments in Israeli literature. Accordingly, eight works of fiction have been selected to lie at the heart of the study. These works, all of which centre around the Israeli military experience, convey an erosion of personal, national, and ideological certainties. The analysis of these works demands three areas of exploration: the depiction of the soldier in the civilian setting, the depiction of the soldier as he interacts with other soldiers in the military sphere, and &#8216;post-Zionist&#8217; military fiction produced in recent decades. These three areas of exploration entail an interrogation of gender, nationalism, and &#8216;post-Zionism&#8217; in contemporary Israel. The works examined in the third chapter contain commentary not only upon the social reality of their authors, but also upon the way in which Israeli literature engages with the issues that inform its existence.This study is fuelled by the need to understand the links between history and fiction, as the latter grapples with the strain of ongoing military conflict. While Yitzhak Laor, Yehosha Kenaz, and Yoram Kaniuk have chosen to explore Israeli militarism through a re-narration of past chapters in Israeli history, Yitzhak Ben-Ner, Amos Oz, Etgar Keret and A. B. Yehoshua all comment on the events of their time. Some authors have identified this strain as a diminishing masculinity; others convey this burden as a direct corollary of shifting truths about Israeli nationalism.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Israeli history, Israeli literature, Israeli militarism, Israel, military, army, fiction, Zionism, post-Zionism, anti-Zionism, Jewish, Jew, IDF</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.infodiv.unimelb.edu.au/00002085/01/Israeli_Military_Fiction_Keren_Rubinstein.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/492</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A unity of vision: the ideas of Dalcroze, Kodaly and Orff and their historical development</field><field name="creator">Giddens,  Micheal John</field><field name="description">Ultimately, the unity of vision discernable in the philosophies and teachings of Dalcroze, Kod&#225;ly and Orff may stimulate contemporary music educators to unify their search for newer and ever more meaningful ways to ignite the spark of musical curiosity in the young, to assist in the development of musicians, and to generally help people discover and appreciate the joy of music.</field><field name="date">1993</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">instruction and study of music, Carl Orff, Emile Jaques-Dalcroze, Zolt&#225;n Kod&#225;ly</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.infodiv.unimelb.edu.au/00002218/01/Giddens.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/550</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Wesleyan Church in Victoria, 1855-1901 : its ministry and membership</field><field name="creator">Howe,  Renate</field><field name="description">For recent church historians the nineteenth century has provided a study of the church in a developing industrial and secular society.

Heat pumps can provide a very efficient means of recovering both sensible and latent heat, hence energy loss can be substantially reduced.

In particular, there is considerable interest in using the short wavelength and high coherence of fourth generation x-ray sources with CDI techniques to phase non-crystalline, or nano-crystalline biomolecular samples. CDI provides an opportunity to determine the structure of proteins and other biological samples which are unable to be phased with the standard techniques of protein crystallography, typically due to lack of adequate crystalline samples.  Methods of non-crystalline phase retrieval are legion, however many suffer from limitations in resolution or the inability to recover phase fields containing a pathological singularity. Wavefields containing phase singularities are common in optical fields.  The creation of an x-ray wavefield containing a pathological phase singularity is demonstrated.  In this thesis a form of CDI termed astigmatic diffraction is presented, that is able tophase uniquely this class of wavefield.  This is achieved by illuminating the sample with beams containing known phase curvature.  The theory of the method and simulations of its application to a nano-crystalline biomolecule are presented.  The experimental recovery of the direction of the phase gradient of a sample illuminated with coherent x-rays produced by a synchrotron source is shown to verify this method.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">phase retrieval, coherent x-ray imaging</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.infodiv.unimelb.edu.au/00001775/01/Mancuso_Experimental_Phase_Retrieval_Using_Coherent_X-Ray_Diffraction_2005.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/642</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The domains of vocational assessment decision-making</field><field name="creator">Gillis,  Shelley A.</field><field name="description">This study investigated the latent structure of vocational assessment decision-making.

It is a sector that has experienced considerable development in terms of number of firms through demand created by the expansion of advertising and multi media.  To date research has established that producer services, particularly finance related ones, agglomerate in the central city to take advantage of the agglomeration economies available in large metropolitan areas.  This thesis argues that one of the key factors for the agglomeration of graphic design is the need for face-to-face communication with clients and other firms.  There has been some work undertaken looking at the location of non-finance producer services, such as design, although these have been presented as snapshots at a point in time.This thesis extends this understanding through an analysis of agglomerations of graphic design firms over a twenty year time horizon.  Using details of firm location in Melbourne every five years from 1981 to 2001 the thesis uses a geospatial analytical technique to identify agglomerations and explores the change in the size, location and density of agglomerations of firms.  This research shows that the initial agglomeration of 1981 was still present by 2001 and had been joined by a number of new agglomerations ringing the Melbourne CBD while at the same time there has also been a dispersal of firms to the middle suburbs.  In order to provide some insight in to the agglomeration of graphic design firms this research also examines the geography of two industries allied to graphic design: advertising and printing.  This research shows that graphic designers and advertising agencies tend to locate in similar parts of inner Melbourne which may be due to the need for face-to-face contact between fims in these two industries.

Manifolds are special examples of spaces called orbifolds, which are modelled locally on R^n modulo finite groups of symmetries. SnapPea can also be used to study orbifolds but it is restricted to those whose singular set is a link.One goal of this thesis is to lay down the theory for a computer program that can work on a much larger class of 3-orbifolds. The work of Casson is generalized and implemented in a computer program Orb which should provide new insight into hyperbolic 3-orbifolds.The other main focus of this work is the study of 2-handle additions. Given a compact 3-manifold M and an essential simple closed curve &#945; on &#8706;M, then we define M[&#945;] to be the manifold obtained by gluing a 2-handle to &#8706;M along &#945;. If &#945; lies on a torus boundary component, we cap off the spherical boundary component created and the result is just Dehn filling.The case when &#945; lies on a boundary surface of genus &#8805; 2 is examined and conditions on &#945; guaranteeing that M[&#945;] is hyperbolic are found. This uses a lemma of Scharlemann and Wu, an argument of Lackenby, and a theorem of Marshall and Martin on the density of strip packings. A method for performing 2-handle additions is then described and employed to study two examples in detail.This thesis concludes by illustrating applications of Orb in studying orbifoldsand in the classification of knotted graphs. Hyperbolic invariants are used to distinguish the graphs in Litherland&#8217;s table of 90 prime &#952;-curves and provide access to new topological information including symmetry groups. Then by prescribing cone angles along the edges of knotted graphs, tables of low volume orbifolds are produced.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">hyperbolic orbifold, orbifolds, tetrahedron, tetrahedra, SnapPea Orb</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.infodiv.unimelb.edu.au/00001577/01/DHeardPhD.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/691</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The experience of depression: women's perspectives</field><field name="creator">Vidler,  Helen C.</field><field name="description">Reports from epidemiological survey data identify that twice as many women than men suffer with depression over the life cycle.

The subjects comprised four groups of ten-and-a-half year old children: a comparison group without behaviour problems, a hostile-aggressive group; an anxious-fearful group; and a comorbid group.

Study 1 found that all the groups of children discriminated between others on the power and distance dimensions in ways consistent with social norms, e.g. adults are judged as more powerful than children. Study 1 also showed that the hostile-aggressive and comorbid groups were significantly less likely to discriminate between others on these dimensions compared to the comparison group. Study 2 showed that for all the children studied politeness as a normative way of speaking was marked by use of please whereas face saving politeness was marked by the use of question directives and hints compared to other request forms.

The tests proposed in previous studies for identifying an object grammatical function turn out to be unreliable and inconsistent when the full range of data is considered. This thesis attempts to clarify the problem by examining non-subject arguments in Indonesian in the theoretical framework of Lexical-Functional Grammar. Both the properties associated with the various types of argument and the means by which they are licensed in clauses turn out to be problematic. Two argument verbs appear in a range of clause types which are related in interesting ways. I argue that it is possible to give a coherent analysis of the system as a whole, treating it as the basic transitive system of the language, when certain relationships are recognised as morphological rather than syntactic. This analysis also reveals similarities between Indonesian and more conservative Austronesian languages such as those of the Philippines. Another type of clause, sometimes referred to as the &#8216;adversative verb&#8217; clause type shares an important property with one of the types of transitive clause, that of allowing an oblique argument to appear without a licensing preposition if it is adjoined to the verb which governs it.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Indonesian language, bahasa indonesian, grammar</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.infodiv.unimelb.edu.au/00000239/01/Musgrave.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/1081</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation of interactivity and flow: student behaviour during online instruction</field><field name="creator">Pearce, Jon Malcolm</field><field name="description">This thesis combines ideas from human-computer interaction, education and psychology to explore the interactions of students in an online learning environment.

Students worked through an online learning experience that offered high and low levels of interactivity.  The aim was to explore their interactions and choices in an environment in which they could elect to move from the highly interactive mode to the less interactive mode at any time.

These online interactions, unconstrained by the limitations of corporeal reality, offer the potential for unique presentations of the self. The general aim of the research described in this thesis was to examine self-presentation in cyberspace. The research focused on MOOs, multi-user, text-based, user-extensible online environments, as a likely site for identity experimentation and play in cyberspace. Two studies are described. In the first quantitative study, 75 university students logged on to the front page of a social MOO where they selected a screen name, chose their gender, and provided a character description. As hypothesised, self-presentations were more likely to be based on actual identity rather than hoped for or feared selves. Contrary to expectation, little evidence was found of gender play. Self-presentations were typically positively biased and results suggested that players also perceived themselves more positively in the online context. Although sex and age were generally unrelated to self-presentation strategies, previous online experience, ethnicity, and personality profiles helped to explain self-presentation behaviour.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">self-presentation in cyberspace, MOOs, multi-user, text-based, user-extensible online environments, online interactions, identity experimentation, game playing</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.infodiv.unimelb.edu.au/00000534/01/chester.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/1391</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The ecology of invertebrate associations with vertebrate carrion in Victoria, with reference to forensic entomology</field><field name="creator">Archer,  Melanie Sian</field><field name="description">Assessing time of death is a notoriously difficult, yet critical component of coronial death investigations.

This study aimed to provide data that will enable a basic forensic entomology service to be provided in Victoria, as well as initiate further development of forensic entomology in this state. There are few quantitative data available on the carcass colonisation patterns of blowflies and flesh flies, however these data are forensically valuable. Colonising maggots form feeding masses that generate heat, and therefore speed the growth of their members. This should be integrated into larval age estimates, however there is little knowledge of the factors controlling mass size and persistence. Additionally, it is important to understand more clearly the behaviour of larvi- and ovipositing female flies since qualitative assessments of abnormal colonisation patterns may be used to indicate pre-mortem trauma to a body.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ecology of invertebrates in Victoria, blowflies, forensic entomology in Victoria</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.infodiv.unimelb.edu.au/00000566/01/Archer.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/1429</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Leon Caron and the music profession in Australia</field><field name="creator">Smart,  Bonnie Jane</field><field name="description">Leon Francis Victor Caron (1850-1905) was one of the major figures in Australian nineteenth-century opera and orchestral circles. He was a well-known and well-liked public figure, regarded with respect and affection by musicians and audiences alike. Little has been written concerning Caron&#8217;s career. Given the amount he contributed to the Australian stage, an assessment of his importance within the music profession is warranted. Most areas of Caron&#8217;s life are, as yet, totally unexplored; it falls outside the ambit of this thesis to present every detail pertaining to his varied and extensive musical career. Nevertheless, new information about a selection of Caron&#8217;s ventures is drawn upon here for the first time. Much of this material is used to examine the impact of Caron&#8217;s conducting on the orchestral profession in Melbourne and Sydney. Many of Caron&#8217;s performances (orchestral or otherwise) often featured the popular music of the day. The popular aspect of Caron as a composer is also considered, with particular reference to the incredibly successful pantomime Djin Djin. An examination of Caron&#8217;s performances gives great insight not only into the part he played in the wider profession; but it also sheds light on orchestral standards, performance practices and public tastes of the time.

One contributing element of this trauma among children relates to pedestrian accidents. Reducing child pedestrian trauma is a complex problem requiring a multi-faceted approach. One approach is through education. This evaluative study explored the links between the implementation of RoadSmart, a new primary school road safety education program developed by VicRoads, and the road crossing behaviour of children in year 2.A process-outcome approach was employed which focused on both the implementation and outcome components of the year 2 "Walking safely" component of the RoadSmart program. RoadSmart offers children first-hand experiences of real-traffic situations and comprises two major parts - school based learning sequences and take-home activities, designed to involve parents/carers in educating their children about road safety. Pre and post unobtrusive observations were undertaken of participating children crossing the road at an unmarked mid-block location and were matched for 44 children. The program was also systematically observed in the classrooms of these students. The findings imply that if teachers implement RoadSmart in the intended manner, students cross roads more safely. Overall findings from this evaluation concur with those of other researchers(Demetre et al., 1993; Rivara, 1990; Roberts, 1980; Thomson et al., 1996), that children under 9 possess capabilities that can be fostered through education and real-street experience to enable them to function more effectively in the traffic environment.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">road trauma, road safety, safety training, injury, children, pedestrian, road accidents</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.infodiv.unimelb.edu.au/00000245/01/Leadbeatter.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/1521</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">'Women in agriculture': A geography of Australian agricultural activism</field><field name="creator">Liepins,  Ruth</field><field name="description">This thesis argues that the multiple geographies of political practice are an important feature of activism.

While such issues are often taken to concern, in broad terms, global governance, more specifically, the political aspects of such governance are fundamentally linked to interactions between the United Nations system and the power exercised by the United States of America (US).  One important and distinctive arena within which these interactions can be viewed is the international food aid regime, and its central organisation, the World Food Programme (WFP) - an area lacking in concerted political science study in recent years.  This thesis is concerned with the role of the US in shaping the legitimacy of the WFP within the institutional context of the international food aid regime.  Legitimacy is defined as deriving from the three elements of inclusion, accountability and effectiveness.  The WFP and international regime are, it is argued, well respected, relatively effective, and enjoy high levels of legitimacy.  At a micro level there are many specific historical and localised factors resulting in this legitimacy; at the macro level many of these factors can be linked to the interaction of norms and interests between the US and the regime.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">international relations, international regimes, food aid, international organizations, United Nations, WFP, FAO, US politics, legitimacy</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/3542</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/3542</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The structure of galaxies and AGN using gravitational lensing</field><field name="creator">Wayth, Randall B.</field><field name="description">A new software tool, Lensview, is developed for the analysis of resolved gravitational lens images.

A climatology of the distribution of each trace gas has been compiled from statistical treatment of the raw data. These climatologies are useful for verification of transport model outputs. Here, the CO2 climatology is compared to simulation results from two transport models (Melbourne University Transport Model and TM2Z) using three different sets of CO2 fluxes separately (compiled with different methods by different authors). Large discrepancies are found between simulations and observations, especially in the free troposphere (4-6 km). By considering emission ratios, trajectories, satellite fire counts and simulation with biomass burning fluxes, the influence of tropical biomass burning plumes on the southeastern Australian region in the austral winter/spring is studied and quantified. This identification process requires a multiple-species approach where the large CO anomalies and the unexpected behaviour of H2 are most revealing. The frequent presence of burning plumes in the mid troposphere complicates one of the original motivations for the Cape Grim Overflight Program, which is to estimate the air-sea exchange of CO2 in this region.

The role of the consultant is construed as that of a dialogue partner with teachers, and specific attention is paid to the consultancy dialogue to analyse how the consultant&#8217;s language choices contributed to the construction of interpersonal relations with teachers. Consultancy literature gives a primary place to the establishment of mutual trust and respect with teachers and offers a number of processes that consultants might adopt to achieve this goal. However, it appears that no linguistic analysis has been undertaken of the consultancy discourse that provides any detailed picture of how the language behaviour of the consultant is implicated in this important process. The resources of systemic functional linguistic and appraisal theories are used by the consultant-researcher to analyse the texts. The linguistic data suggest that relationships with teachers are built around two elements: camaraderie and solidarity. Camaraderie accounts for the prevailing positive dispositions that underlie the relations between people, like teachers, who share the same profession. Solidarity has to be constructed anew in each consultation through the sharing of the consultant&#8217;s appraisals that indicate to teachers the mindset, the nature and intensity of the consultant&#8217;s point of view concerning the issues under consideration.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">educational consultants, linguistic analysis, linguistics, language and education</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.infodiv.unimelb.edu.au/00003824/01/baker_g._final.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/1606</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The proximate advocate: improving indigenous health on the postcolonial frontier</field><field name="creator">Kowal, Emma Esther</field><field name="description">This thesis presents an ethnography of white researchers who work at the Darwin Institute of Indigenous Health Research.

This thesis is intended as a critical dialogue with world system theorists.World systems arguments are constructive for understanding how Lihirians have remained economically marginal.However, I reject the assertion commonly propounded in these approaches that the world capitalist system inevitably destroys &#8216;traditional&#8217; cultures and remakes them to its own specifications. Working from Sahlins&#8217; (1985, 1992) premise that there is always continuity in change, I have sought to illustrate those enduring structures and received cultural values that have shaped Lihirian engagement with the capitalist system. My concern iswith articulation rather than penetration; to capture the dialectic of global structural inequalities and Lihirian selective appropriation. This approach allows me to emphasise the heterogeneity of Lihirian culture, notonly prior to sustained European contact, or even mining activities, but specifically at the height of their engagement with the capitalist system.

Media ethics and media performance in relation to quality of media content are identified as the two main dimensions of media accountability. They may be conceived of as the means and the ends of media work.  The thesis represents the first combined survey of both external mechanisms of accountability in Australia &#8211; those existing outside the various media organisations &#8211; and the internal mechanisms existing within three of Australia&#8217;s largest media organisations.  These organisations span print and broadcasting, public and private ownership.

It is also based on two quantitative surveys, one among practitioners of journalism and the other among the public they serve.  This combination of research is certainly new in Australia, and no comparable study has been found in other Western countries.  In addition to the main qualitative and quantitative surveys, three case studies are presented.  One deals with media performance in relation to quality of media content (the case of alleged bias brought against the Australian Broadcasting Corporation by the then Senator Richard Alston); one deals with media ethics (the &#8220;cash-for-comment&#8221; cases involving various commercial radio broadcasters), and one deals with accountability processes (the &#8220;Who Is Right?&#8221; experiment at The Sydney Morning Herald).</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">mass media and public opinion in Australia, mass media in community development, political aspects, media ethics</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.infodiv.unimelb.edu.au/00002967/01/Muller.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/1552</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ecology and management of overabundant koala (Phascolarctos cinereus) populations</field><field name="creator">McLean, Natasha</field><field name="description">Overabundant species may have considerable impacts on their habitat, other species and their own populations, thereby threatening biodiversity. Koalas (Phascolarctoscinereus) are overabundant at a number of locations in southeastern Australia due to low mortality and the inability of individuals to emigrate. This has led to the over-browsing of their food resources. Active management is required in order to prevent habitat degradation and the starvation of koalas particularly in populations without Chlamydia-infection, a disease that can cause infertility in females. Predictive population modelling is required if we are to understand the dynamics of the overabundant populations and investigate the consequences and effectiveness of different management strategies. Accurate data for the parameters that contribute to population growth, such as age structure, sex ratio, and age-specific schedules of mortality and fecundity, are therefore needed. In this study, the values of these parameters were determined for overabundant koala populations at Snake Island, Framlingham, Mt Eccles and French Island (Victoria). Data from additional populations were used to ascertain some parameters.

These programs comprise many elements. Some, like History of Ideas and Western Literature, provide foreign students with the educational background expected of all students pursuing tertiary studies in western universities. Others, like English for Academic Purposes (EN) provide the everyday skills needed for success at university. This trend raises the question: Are current EAP courses meeting the academic needs of international students when it comes to succeeding at university? And, if they are not, what can be done to these EAP courses? Traditionally, decisions about student needs (needs analysis) have been left to the teachers and researchers in the field.

(2001)) for Natural Language Processing (NLP). CRFs are probabilistic models for sequence labelling which are particularly well suited to NLP. They have many compelling advantages over other popular models such as Hidden Markov Models and Maximum Entropy Markov Models (Rabiner, 1990; McCallum et al., 2001), and have been applied to a number of NLP tasks with considerable success (e.g., Sha and Pereira (2003) and Smith et al. (2005)). Despite their apparent success, CRFs suffer from two main failings. Firstly, they often over-fit the training sample. This is a consequence of their considerable expressive power, and can be limited by a prior over the model parameters (Sha and Pereira, 2003; Peng and McCallum, 2004). Their second failing is that the standard methods for CRF training are often very slow, sometimes requiring weeks of processing time. This efficiency problem is largely ignored in current literature, although in practise the cost of training prevents the application of CRFs to many new more complex tasks, and also prevents the use of densely connected graphs, which would allow for much richer feature sets.

Esteemed as the most elaborate and expensive socio-religious festival of the Subanen, the Buklog derives its name from a wooden structure holding the dancing platform called buklog. The Buklog is generally celebrated to propitiate the gods in some specific event in which the entire Subanen community participates.

Rick</field><field name="description">Every single person on earth is a road-user; and, although an integral part of our society, the management of traffic is a low priority for most. Authorities constantly work to lessen the tension between the free-flow of traffic and traffic safety. Consequently, the management of traffic and its subsequent problems has consumed more time, money and resources than any other item on the public agenda. Between 1890 and 1930, urban road-traffic in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, as in other world cities, underwent a revolution as speeds increased 500%. The motor-vehicle exacerbated existing traffic problems with increased trips and vehicle numbers. Authorities separated the various road users with road demarcations, and placed upon the Victoria Police the responsibility of managing the heterogeneous and complex traffic mix. By the close of the 1920s, all the components&#8212;policing, case and statute law, and the physical infrastructure&#8212;of the contemporary traffic management system were firmly in place. Introducing motor-transport into a centuries old road network designed for much slower modes of transport, was similar to putting high speed trains, capable of hundreds of kilometres an hour, onto conventional tracks. The marriage of old systems and new technology required a plethora of controls, procedures and safeguards to attain an acceptable level of traffic deaths. Nonetheless, no matter how many modifications, it persisted as a hybrid system. It could not be made to work efficiently.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">traffic police, Victoria, Melbourne, history</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.infodiv.unimelb.edu.au/00003796/01/Intersections_of_Conflict.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/1596</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modelling and control of an automotive electromechanical brake</field><field name="creator">Line, Christopher Leonard James</field><field name="description">This thesis describes the modelling and control of an electromechanical brake (EMB) for a drive-by-wire vehicle.

Part One is headed by a fairly broad historiographic review into past works on the Chinese in Australia. This is followed by a brief introduction to the historical and cultural background of the immigrants and the character of their migration. An examination of the passive and proudly in different responses of the Chinese to Victorian anti-Chinese legislation concludes this section. The stress of this final chapter is on the overall lack of influence of the White Australian Policy on the behaviour of the Chinese. Part Two examines the sojourning sentiments of the Chinese and how they affected the sex and age distribution of the population, their choice and method of work, their accommodation and quality of life. Part Three begins by contrasting the impact of science and technology on Australia and China and the focus will be on China&#8217;s peripheral position in the industrial world. The insecurity of the Chinese in the industrialising environment of Australia will be considered. This will be contrasted by the more accommodating cultural milieu of Southeast Asia and the important thread of Chinese culture and traditions throughout the region&#8217;s history. The importance of the &#8216;modified&#8217; or &#8216;mixed&#8217; version of the family business in assisting the rise of the Chinese in the Southeast Asian region will be discussed. The final part of the thesis will suggest that the decline of the Victorian Chinese in the four occupations of alluvial mining, furniture-making, market-gardening and laundering was significantly affected by an inflexible attitude to technology. It is argued that the Chinese did not apply science and advanced equipment when it was prudent to do so. The conclusion will summarise the main argument and suggest its relevance for the modern overseas Chinese communities.</field><field name="date">1993</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chinese, Victoria, economic conditions, Chinese history, Social conditions</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.infodiv.unimelb.edu.au/00004238/01/chou.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/2269</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of a breeding program for drug detector dogs: based on studies of a breeding population of guide dogs</field><field name="creator">Champness,  Kathryn Anne</field><field name="description">A joint research project was undertaken by the Australian Customs Service (Customs),Royal Guide Dogs Associations of Australia (RGDAA) and The University of Melbourne.

T.</field><field name="description">B cell development is a carefully orchestrated process involving many transcription factors acting in concert with cytokine signals, particularly IL-7. The transcription factor c-Myb has long been implicated in B cell development, however surprisingly little is known about the function of c-Myb in B cell progenitors. I have used several mouse models of c-Myb deficiency to investigate the role of c-Myb in the B cell lineage. Conditional deletion of c-Myb in early B cell progenitors using mb-1Cre (c Myb&#916;mb1/&#916;mb1) leads to a striking lack of B cells from the pre-pro-B cell stage onwards, demonstrating that c-Myb is absolutely required for B cell development. Mice homozygous for a hypomorphic allele of c-Myb (c MybPlt4/Plt4) also display a severe reduction in B cells; in these mice, defects in lymphoid development can be detected within the multipotent progenitor compartment of bone marrow. c-Myb activates transcription via coactivator proteins, particularly CBP and p300. Mice bearing a point mutation in p300 (p300Plt6/Plt6) that inhibits the interaction of p300 with c Myb display a partial block in B cell development, highlighting the importance of the c Myb-p300 complex for B cell development. Together, these mice demonstrate that c-Myb regulates B cell development by functioning both in multipotent progenitor cells and directly in B cell progenitors. In addition, I show that the B-lymphopenia in c-Myb deficient mice is related to a profound defect in IL-7 signalling. IL-7 normally stimulates the proliferation, survival and differentiation of B cell progenitors, however pro-B cells from c-MybPlt4/Plt4 and c Myb&#916;mb1/&#916;mb1 mice fail to respond to IL 7. Expression of the IL-7R&#945; chain is reduced on pro-B cells from c MybPlt4/Plt4 and c-Myb&#916;mb1/&#916;mb1 mice, suggesting that Il7r may be a c-Myb target gene in B cells. Reporter gene assays show that c-Myb can activate the Il7r promoter in synergy with the transcription factor Pu.1. Overall, this work demonstrates that c-Myb is essential for early B cell development and plays a critical role in linking cytokine signals to the transcription factor networks in B cell progenitors.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">B cell development, c-Myb, hematopoiesis, IL-7, transcription factor</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/3824</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/3824</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cercosporoid fungi on Australian native plants</field><field name="creator">Beilharz, Vyrna Caldwell</field><field name="description">Pseudocercospora is currently separated from Cercospora largely on the basis of its unthickened scars. The principal aim of this study was to test the validity of this criterion by studying the ultrastructural characteristics of scars of cercosporoid fungi growing on Australian native plants. Transmission electron microscope studies demonstrated considerable variation in scar morphology among species of Pseudocercospora. Scars varied from substantially thickened (as in P. loranthi) to unthickened (as in P. correae), with intermediate types. The external deposit can be too thin to be usually visible under the light microscope, as in Pseudocercospora clematidis, P. hardenbergiae and the Pseudocercospora on Eucalyptus macrorhyncha. The description of Pseudocercospora needs to be modified to permit the inclusion of species with external scar thickening. Wall involvement in conidiophore and conidium ontogeny were also studied at the ultrastructural level for species of Pseudocercospora and Verrucisporota. Conidiophores were generally holoblastic, but enteroblastic ontogeny was observed in several conidiophores of P. correae and P. platylobii. Conidia were always holoblastic, and secession was schizolytic. Proliferation of the conidiogenous cell was variously enteroblastic sympodial, pseudopercurrent or holoblastic sympodial.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cercosporoid, fungi, native, plants, Australia, scars, unthickened, Australian native plants</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/2431</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mathematical and computer modelling of the enteric nervous system</field><field name="creator">Thomas, Evan Alexander</field><field name="description">The enteric nervous system (ENS) runs within the intestinal wall and is responsible for initiating and enacting several reflexes and motor patterns, including peristalsis and the complex interdigestive motor programs, known as migrating motor complexes (MMCs). The ENS consists of several neuron types including intrinsic sensory neurons, interneurons and motor neurons. A great deal is known about the anatomy, pharmacology and electrophysiology of the ENS, yet there is almost no understanding of how enteric neural circuits perform the functions that they do and how they switch from one function to another. The ENS contains intrinsic sensory neurons (ISNs) that connect to every neuron type in the ENS, including making recurrent connections amongst themselves. Thus, they are likely to play a key role, not just in sensory transduction, but in coordination of reflexes and motor patterns. This thesis has explored how these functions are performed by developing and analysing mathematical and computer models of the network of ISNs.

Consequently, while existing student-choice models drawn from elsewhere provide a useful foundation, they are not sufficient to answer the key question: How do students choose universities in Australia? Implicit in this overarching question are several issues examined by this study: how a student makes a choice is related to what choices there are to be made, and why the student makes a choice about a particular institution.

Its aim is to establish an understanding of the relationship between changes of Thai residents&#8217; experiences of well-being, or Khwam Phasook in the Thai language, and the physical and socio-cultural evolution of their vernacular houses.  The study was conducted by examining the evolution of vernacular houses in Tambon Pakkran of Pra Nakhon Si Ayutthaya in central Thailand.  Two main types of data were collected: evolution of the physical characteristics of vernacular houses, and the changes of patterns of use and the meanings attributed to them.

The rodent malaria parasite P. chabaudi is a widely studied in vivo model for P. falciparum. The P. c. chabaudi AS parasite strain has been shown to exhibit antigenic variation and the variant antigen has been detected by surface fluorescence. As with P. falciparum, there is a link between antigenic variation and cytoadherence, however genes coding for the variant antigen in P. chabaudi have not been cloned to date.

The World Bank initiated Rural Women&#8217;s Development and Empowerment Project was funded with the primary objective of working towards women&#8217;s economic and social empowerment through the formation of self-help groups.  Within the framework of Gender and Development (GAD), women&#8217;s development and participation has to fulfil both practical and strategic gender needs in order for them to gain, share and exercise power.  In women&#8217;s development, the economic cannot be understood apart from the social and the political.  Transformative or genuine participation for women involves a process of partnership where one or more forms of power are attained through social capital and the participants are able to surmount structural barriers.  Genuine participation can be achieved only through the processes of partnership and control, that is, through the building of equitable relationships among the primary beneficiaries themselves and between the primary beneficiaries and external agents.  The incentives to participate and the pattern of participation are influenced by the material expectations and the social reality of women.

After 1560 the requirements of Catholic Reform and theoretical texts such as G.B. Armenini's treatise On the True Precepts of Painting influenced developments in both style and subject. Moralising messages simultaneously contained meanings specific to the patron. In addition, the genre of landscape became a popular subject capable of expressing spiritual ideals. The thesis then focuses on the Palazzo Pamphilj in Piazza Navona, Rome, where Giambattista Pamphilj commissioned ten narrative fresco friezes in two phases, originally to mark his promotion to cardinal (1629-1644), then to celebrate his ascendancy to the papal throne as Innocent X (1644-1655). Little has been written on the decorative programme and the thesis seeks to explain why Rome's leading patron adopted the 'old-fashioned' frieze when a more 'modern' form of decoration, the illusionistically painted barrel-vaulted ceiling, had been chosen by Innocent's predecessor, Urban VIII Barberini (1623-1644), whose family residence appeared likely to set new trends.

How does the law influence real life contractual arrangements?  These are everyday questions for businesspeople and commercial lawyers.  The traditional &#8216;imperative&#8217; view of law assumes that business people contract &#8216;in the shadow of the law&#8217; and contractual arrangements conform to what the law says.  But empirical studies on contract practice suggest that contract law may, in fact, play a very insignificant role in real life contractual arrangements.  This thesis provides a sociological view of the role of contract law in real life contractual arrangements in the context of the Vietnamese market.  Specifically, this thesis applies an institutional law &amp; economics approach to investigate how social structures of the market influence contractual arrangements to marginalize contract law in the Vietnamese market.  Drawing on two surveys of contract behaviour in the Vietnamese market, this thesis finds that real life contractual arrangements respond to the institutional structure of the market as a whole, rather than only &#8216;the shadow of the law&#8217;.  Institutional changes in the Vietnamese market suggest that there exists a merchant law system, constituted of traditional moral norms and social structures in the market.  This merchant law system continues to order contractual arrangements in the market, despite the introduction of a transplanted contract law system.  Disagreeing with the imperative approach, this thesis claims that contract law reform should conform to the institutional structure of the market to reduce transaction costs of contracting and to provide an effective framework for real life contractual arrangements.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">contract law, contract law in action, relational contract theory, contract management, Vietnam, doing business in Vietnam, commercial law in Asia, business law in Vietnam, law and Confucianism, social norms, investment in Asia, investment in Vietnam, institutional law and economics, law and game theory, commercial law reform, law reform, commercial law reform in Vietnam, commercial law reform in Asia, trading relationships in Asia, business relationships in Asia, business management in Vietnam, institutional reform in Vietnam, Vietnamese market, Vietnamese economy, Vietnamese law, Vietnamese commercial law, contract law reform in Vietnam, contract management in Vietnam, legal development in Vietnam, outsourcing in Vietnam, Asian markets, contractual relationships, Vietnam business, law and economics in Vietnam, business opportunities Vietnam, Chinese Vietnamese, Chinese business in Vietnam, market in Vietnam, business administration in Vietnam, Vietnamese legal system, Vietnamese court system, dispute resolution in Vietnam, commercial dispute resolution in Vietnam, conflict resolution in Vietnam, business dispute resolution in Vietnam, legal history in Vietnam, institutional development in Vietnam, contracting in Vietnam, government contracts in Vietnam, insight business in Vietnam, legal anthropology, law and development, transitional economy, Confucian moral norms, traditional social structures in Vietnam, merchants' law in Vietnam, ethnic-based trade in Vietnam, game theory models of contracting, transaction cost model of contracting, legal transplant in Vietnam, interviews of Vietnamese merchants, business interviews in Vietnam, social networks in Vietnam, business dispute settlement in Asia, freedom of contract in Vietnam, business regulation in Vietnam</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.infodiv.unimelb.edu.au/00002265/01/Social_Structures_of_Contracts.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/313</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Child protection assessment: an ecological perspective</field><field name="creator">Scott, Dorothy Ann</field><field name="description">In a semi-longitudinal exploratory study using observational and in-depth interviewing methods the following questions were explored through an intensive analysis of 10 families involving 17 allegedly abused children.</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">risk assessment, abused children, child support, child protection</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/3309</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/3309</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Active transport journey planner methodology</field><field name="creator">Hu, W.</field><field name="description">This research aims to define and develop a methodology to assist an individual traveller to select healthier and more sustainable transport routes and modes among admissible transport options and highlight the trade-offs among multiple objectives in terms of health, economic, social and environmental benefits.

S.

Either by experiment or theory these aspects have been described in different ways. This thesis describes some experimental programmes on prepacked concrete that include its manufacture and a study of its strength, deformation and failure mechanism. To compare these aspects, normal concretes having the same water-cement and aggregate-cement ratios were made and tested under the same condition. The experimental work investigates the use of different types of admixture in grout in order to improve the strength of prepacked concrete. Among them the expanding admixture was found to be most suitable. Data are presented on some properties of grout using different types of admixture at various sand-cement ratios.

In addition, increased public acceptance of the global warming problem has prompted car manufacturers to agree to carbon emission targets in many regions including most recently, the Californian standards. Other legislating bodies are sure to follow this lead with increasingly stringent targets.  As a result of these issues, spark ignition engines in their current form will need significant improvements to meet future requirements. One technically feasible option is smaller capacity downsized engines with enhanced power that could be used in the near term to reduce both carbon emissions and fuel consumption in passenger vehicles.This research focuses on exploring the performance limits of a 0.43 liter spark ignited engine and defining its operating boundaries. Limiting factors such as combustion, gas exchange and component design are investigated to determine if they restrict small engine performance. The research gives direction to the development of smaller gasoline engines and establishes the extent to which they can contribute to future powertrain fuel consumption reduction whilst maintaining engine power at European intermediate class requirements.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">small engine, performance limits, turbocharging, combustion, engine design, odd fire, two cylinder, formula SAE, CO2 emissions, oil supply, global warming, oil shortages, fuel consumption</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.infodiv.unimelb.edu.au/00002552/01/Attard_PhD.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/514</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies of hybrids between members of viatica group of morabine grasshoppers</field><field name="creator">Mrongovius, Margaret Joan</field><field name="description">The hybrids of three members of the viatica group of morabine grasshoppers from Kangaroo Island, South Australia, were studied.

This design approach results in expensive structures and is not consistent with the design philosophy commonly adopted for general structure which permits some inelastic response at the ultimate limit state event. A research program funded by the CICIND organisation has been undertaken to investigate the inelastic cyclic behaviour of tall reinforce concrete chimneys using both experimental and analytical techniques to determine whether the behaviour is brittle or ductile.

Interviews were conducted with forty-five prisoners and fifteen ex-prisoners (who had been released from prison as Christians) - all high/medium-security inmates with long sentences.  The study had two basic aims: to examine aspects of their religious backgrounds, experiences, and beliefs, and whether Christianity benefited and/or hindered them;  second, to investigate their religious needs (in prison and post-release), whether they were being met, and the likely effect to potential benefits of existing support structures.  It was anticipated that existing support would be inadequate to meet the men&#8217;s needs, particularly those who had been released from prison.  In relation to these issues the findings are both positive and negative.  With few exceptions, Christian prisoners/ex-prisoners believed that being a Christian made a qualitative difference to life in prison, offering essential hope, meaning and purpose in life, a positive outlook, and productive use of time.  Christianity provided a different way of life, with new morals, values, and a renewed sense of self that helped overcome guilt and generally enhanced relationships.  Belonging to a religious group provided practical and moral/spiritual support, which assisted prison adjustment and personal security. Moreover, Christian inmates had more self-control and tolerance/respect (than they ordinarily would)  for authorities and others, resulting in fewer institutional rule violations.

This thesis has combined ideas from human computer interaction (HCI) and architecture to investigate indexicality in interface design as an instrument for incorporating physical and social context of the built environment into context-aware pervasive computing. Indexicality in interface design is a new approach to designing HCI for pervasive computing that relies on knowledge of current context to implicitly communicate between system and user.

In this study length of stay is examined as a programmatic rationality, evident in the reengineering of the modern hospital. However, the focus of analysis is not the &#8216;effect&#8217; of this reengineering, as seen in the substantial changes to hospital treatments and the shifting burden of responsibility for health and ill-health care to individuals and communities.

Established farm plantings were identified for the necessary sampling and measurements but, as broadscale P.pinaster planting on farms is a relatively new venture, those available for study were mostly small-scale and not managed for current timber production objectives. Therefore new methods for sampling, data analysis and modelling were developed or adapted to indicate the growth and carbon sequestration that will be achieved in the new plantations. The system developed for site quality assessment is a two-stage process. Firstly, survival rate is predicted from annual pan evaporation and soil salinity. Then, site index (SI) is predicted from annual rainfall and six soil variables: soil salinity, depth to bedrock, depth to gravel layer, depth of pale soil, presence of high watertable, and soil colour at 5 cm soil depth. A difference equation form of the Chapman-Richards growth model is applied to predict future stemwood volume yield from measurement of current or past stemwood volume. Alternatively, in the case where P.pinaster has not been grown at a site, or no growth measurements are available, yield is predicted from SI. In both cases the yield prediction models were developed for fully-stocked block plantings, wider-spaced block plantings and belt plantings. A thinning model simulates the response of stemwood volume to thinning operations in block plantings.

By focusing attention on the workplace a number of important questions are raised that have not been systematically addressed in Australian industrial relations research. In particular, what, if any, is the role of shop stewards in a centralised system dominated by unions, employers and tribunals organised on a state and national basis? If there is a role for shop stewards, how does this role manifest itself in terms of the stewards&#8217; relationships with members, fellow shop stewards, union officials and management? Finally, what factors explain variations in role perceptions, and how does the adoption of a particular role affect the behaviour of shop stewards?

The investigation set out to answer two research questions: What are the forms of autonomy expected of students in project-based classes?, and What are the factors that mediate the employment of autonomy in these classes? The investigation gathered qualitative data from students and teachers of four project-based, computer-assisted courses in four language departments at The University of Melbourne. The study was carried out in two stages, over two years. In all, a total of ten 14-week classes run by four teachers were investigated, containing a total of 136 students. The first year (stage one of the investigation) focussed on teacher practice and course syllabi, and addressed the first research question. The second year (stage two), focussed on student practice and addressed the second research question.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">computer-assisted language learning, CALL, autonomy, classroom practice, PrOCALL, activity theory, learner-centred teaching and learning, collaborative learning</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.infodiv.unimelb.edu.au/00001476/01/MASmith_PhD_2005.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/1055</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The reforms to mental health and their impact on the empowerment of consumers and carers</field><field name="creator">Lammers,  Arthur John</field><field name="description">The intention of this thesis is to explore and discuss the experiences of consumers and carers with psychiatric disability support services.

It is characterized primarily by relative or absolute insufficiency of insulin secretion (type I diabetes or IDDM) or concomitant insensitivity / resistance to the metabolic action of insulin on target tissues (Type II diabetes or NIDDM), both resulting in hyperglycaemia. Diabetes mellitus is known to induce microvascular changes and alterations to neuronal functions. The neurovascular system comprising of unmyelinated primary afferent sensory neurones and the microvasculature innervated by these nerves play a major role in modulating inflammatory and tissue repair processes. Sensory nerve terminals respond to injury via the release of sensory neuropeptides which mediate inflammation and tissue repair. These processes are known to be altered in diabetes. This thesis is concerned with the role of diabetes in modulating microvascular blood flow directly and indirectly via modulating sensory nerve activity and the effect of these changes on repair processes in skin of 4 weeks streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats. The following hypotheses were examined: 1. That factors implicated in long-term diabetic vascular damage play a role in altering skin microvascular function in early diabetes. 2. That preventing the deleterious effects of these factors could improve skin microvascular blood flow and skin repair processes in early diabetes.

The study of fifteen selected A1-Si minerals shows that the framework structured A1-Si minerals with a high CaO content and a lower K2O content, have a higher potential to undergo geopolymerisation in KOH solution with resulting geopolymers possessing a higher compressive strength.  The NaOH solution is observed to leach more A1 and Si complexes from the solid reactants than KOH solution, while KOH solution produces geopolymers with a higher mechanical strength than NaOH solution does.

Augmented reality, a technology that overlays digital information with views of the real world, requires accurate and precise position and attitude determination to operate effectively. For small (often indoor) areas, careful preparation of the environment can allow for augmented reality systems to work successfully. In large outdoor environments, however, such preparation is often impractical, time-consuming and costly. This thesis aims to investigate the development of a position and attitude determination component for augmented reality systems capable of operation in outdoor unprepared environments. The hypothesis tested in this investigation is that the integration of Global Positioning System (GPS), Dead Reckoning (DR) and map matching techniques enables the continuous and accurate real-time visual alignment of three-dimensional data with objects in the perspective view of a user operating in outdoor unprepared environments.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">augmented reality, position and attitude determination, real-time, navigation, land vehicle</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.infodiv.unimelb.edu.au/00000827/01/Thesis.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/1111</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The relationship between anxiety vulnerability and stress in the cognitive processing of threat-related information</field><field name="creator">Kennedy,  Simon G.</field><field name="description">In order to clarify the relationship between anxiety vulnerability and clinical anxiety, information-processing models have been employed to examine the cognitive biases of anxious individuals for threat-related information.

The purpose for which it was designed, coupled with the technologythat was available at the time, resulted in a paper based system of plans and indexes. Due tomany external factors, the current land registration system has essentially remained the samefor the past 130 years. However the need for cadastral information means that plan lodgementnow serves a wider range of needs, and although changes have been made to the system, itwould seem that document-based systems are reaching the limit of cost-effectiveimprovement.A detailed study of the Victorian system of data lodgement has shown there to be severalinefficiencies within the system, many of which would benefit by the shift to a digitalenvironment. Research has also shown that the Victorian surveying profession is actuallyquite prepared to adapt to a digital environment, with many surveyors already preparing orsubmitting plans digitally.Other jurisdictions that are experiencing similar problems to Victoria have progressedsubstantially in this area and form ideal examples to learn from. The study of thesejurisdictions has shown that although technically the process of lodging data in a digitalformat is quite straightforward, there are still many technical and legal problems that must beresolved.It is envisaged that in the future, data be lodged in a digital format, which would involve there-engineering of the Victorian land registration system as we know it.

There are not sufficient public police to provide adequate response and protection to businesses; therefore, private security agents have grown in number as a response to this perceived need.  This thesis examines private security and surveillance in the hotel industry.  There is a general introduction to contemporary security issues in society.  The specific nature of these problems is examined within the context of the hotel industry.  These issues are analysed in relationship to recent scholarly literature.  Since so little has been written about problems of security in the hotel industry, it was decided to conduct in-depth interviews, using multiple case studies and field observations.  The thesis examines issues of security in seven major hotels in Australia.  Although there are many alternative ways that security can be organised, this thesis examines the application of a differentiated model of security as contrasted to an imbedded model in which all employees are involved with security procedures.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">security measures of hotels, evaluation of private security services, private police</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.infodiv.unimelb.edu.au/00000321/01/Niblo.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/993</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dispute Resolution for Customary Lands in Fiji</field><field name="creator">Fonmanu, Mz.

Land and land tenure systems are the keyelements and the key forces which shape the society. However, theconstraints of the land tenure system and the effects of rapid economicdevelopment are visible throughout the world today, especially in lessdeveloped countries. Therefore land problems often break out as disputes. Inthis context, this thesis concentrates on customary land tenure and thecustomary land problems in Fiji.The main purpose of this thesis is to propose an alternative centre for theadministration and management of customary disputes, which will utiliseland information and geographical information to its maximum capabilities.It is anticipated that this model would assist customary landowners, landadministrators and land managers to resolve customary land disputes. TheFiji customary land tenure system is examined, in particular, landownership,land boundaries and land administration. These three topics are discussedindividually and then discussed as a basis of land disputes. It is in these threeareas that a procedure is developed into a system that may help in customaryland dispute resolution.This thesis aims to assist all other countries with customary land tenureproblems, especially those countries of the South Pacific that share the sameprinciples and the same flexibility.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fiji, Land Administration, land tenure, customary land, dispute resolution</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.infodiv.unimelb.edu.au/00001051/01/keresi.zip</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/1189</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Heidelberg School and the rural mythology</field><field name="creator">Astbury,  David Leigh</field><field name="description">The thesis covers Melbourne in the 1870s: the formative years; the Heidelberg School and the popular image; George Folingsby: Australian narrative painting; the social and cultural background of the rural mythology; freedom and independence: &#8216;On the Wallaby Track&#8217;; Tom Roberts: &#8216;Strong, masculine labour&#8217;; Frederick McCubbin: the spirit of the pioneers; The Lost Child: nature&#8217;s enticing but treacherous beauty.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Heidelberg school of painters, history of Australian painting in the 19th century</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.infodiv.unimelb.edu.au/00000426/01/Astbury_Vol1.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/1273</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Interfacial effects on aqueous sonochemistry and sonoluminescence</field><field name="creator">Sostaric, Joe Zeljko</field><field name="description">The dissolution of quantum sized CdS and MnO2 particles in water was conducted using 20 kHz ultrasound. CdS particles were found to dissolve chemically via an oxidation process while MnO2 particles dissolved via a reductive process. It was found that the dissolution of the colloids could be controlled via the addition of surface active chemicals to solution and by varying the saturation gas type. In the presence of Na2S or propan-2-ol and argon gas, the dissolution of CdS was inhibited, whereas the addition of alcohols (methanol, ethanol, propan-2-ol, butan-1-ol and pentan-1-ol) to the MnO2 system led to an increase in the amount of dissolution for a given time of sonication. This increase in dissolution was found to be dependent on the ability of the surface active radical scavenger to accumulate around the bubble interface during the cavitation process. Eventually, at higher alcohol concentration there was a plateau or a limiting value reached for the efficiency of colloid dissolution which was common for each alcohol.

The principal aim of this study was to assess which species of native mammals, birds and higher plants are able to utilise or occupy such plantations. Successional aspects of community structure, and colonisation in pine forest systems, were investigated by considering stands of different ages.

The research explores the involvement of key stakeholders in the curriculum development processes and the curriculum itself. The study is a qualitative approach, which, in collecting the data, employs in-depth interviews with the kyais (leaders), ustadzs (teachers), and santris (students); observation on the pesantrens&#8217; daily life and classroom activities; and relevant documentation. The findings suggest that there are similarities and differences in both pesantrens in the curriculum development processes. Both pesantrens can be classified as Site-Based Managed Schools in which all interactions of the members are permeated with some values. However, Pesantren A has a rather collaborative and goal-oriented curriculum development process, while Pesantren B tended to conduct a single-handed and content-oriented one. The curriculum of Pesantren A is a subject-based curriculum accommodating both religious and non-religious disciplines in relatively the same proportion, whereas that of Pesantren B is a kitab (book)-based curriculum accommodating largely religious disciplines. Overall, it was found that both pesantrens need to conduct more collaborative and systematic curriculum processes. To do so, since ustadzs have a significant influence on the curriculum, there is a need for well-directed and organised professional development programs focusing on pedagogical issues. There is also a need to set some indicators for curriculum evaluation based on the context of Islamic education and immediate societal demands.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Islamic education, pesantren, Indonesia curriculum development, curriculum planning, traditional education, modern education, Islamic traditions, South Kalimantan, kyai, ustadz, santri, pondok, kitab kuning, fiqh, tawhid</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.infodiv.unimelb.edu.au/00000994/01/final_draft_of_thesis.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/1255</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Globalisation of the pharmaceutical industry and the Australian state: the transformation of a policy network</field><field name="creator">Lofgren,  Hans Vilhelm Martin</field><field name="description">Processes of rationalisation and restructuring within the international drug industry in the past decade have altered the conditions for governance of Australia&#8217;s pharmaceutical sector.

In producing an analysis that locates the museum within cultural, political, economic and museological contexts, I examine how the museum&#8217;s particular institutional program develop, and point to limitations in its policy and practice.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">museum, New Zealand, Te Papa Tongarewa, museums, cultural politics, Taonga, national identity, cultural policy, Maori politics, new museology, Pakeha identity, exhibitions, Treaty of Waitangi, South Pacific museums</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.infodiv.unimelb.edu.au/00000765/13/harveycomplete.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/1542</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Natural language understanding in controlled virtual environments</field><field name="creator">Ye, Patrick</field><field name="description">Generating computer animation from natural language instructions is a complex task that encompasses several key aspects of artificial intelligence including natural language understanding, computer graphics and knowledge representation.

Planning for pedestrians is becoming more important as planners and engineers become more aware of the sustainability and environmental aspects of transport and infrastructure. It is also necessary for the planning and management of pedestrian areas and events. Pedestrian behaviour is more difficult to model than other transport modes as it is not as constrained and operates at a finer scale. Many approaches have been developed for modelling pedestrian behaviour. The simplest involve a single mathematical equation taking into account area and attractiveness of an area to calculate the maximum capacity. More complicated mathematical models involving differential equations have also been used. Agent-based modelling is a recent development in modelling and simulation. These simulations contain agents who interact with each other and the environment in which they are situated. Their similarity to human societies has led to their use for many social applications. Many modellers are unsure of what agents are and how to develop models using them. In some cases, agents may be useful. In other cases, the model outputs and realism may not offset the learning curve, development time, and increased complexity of an agent-based model.

Mawng&#8217;s five genders have a strong semantic basis. In verbs with lexicalised agreement, a verbal pronominal prefix that usually indexes a core argument of a particular gender instead functions to specify a particular sense of the verb. Such verbs form a significant portion of the verbal lexicon in Mawng. An investigation of these verbs requires an updated description of Mawng, which has not been the object of linguistic study for some time.  A non-Pama Nyungan language of the Iwaidjan language family, Mawng is still spoken by around three hundred people living on the north-west coast of Arnhem land, Northern Territory, Australia. This description is based on new fieldwork carried out at Warruwi (Goulburn Island) and adds to what was previously known about the Mawng language. Complex verb constructions, reciprocal constructions, argument structure, complex sentences, NP structure, the semantic basis of the gender system and the nature of verbal agreement are some of the topics explored in greater detail in this thesis than previously available materials. Lexicalised agreement was not discussed in previous work on Mawng.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mawng, typology, dummy arguments, verbal semantics, Australian languages</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.infodiv.unimelb.edu.au/00003242/01/Agreement_in_Mawng.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/1974</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Trachoma in Australia: an evaluation of the SAFE strategy and the barriers to its implementation</field><field name="creator">Wright, Heathcote R.</field><field name="description">Trachoma is known to be a significant cause of blindness in Australia. It was brought into the public spotlight 30 years ago by Fred Hollows. Unfortunately public interest has waned and so have efforts to combat this terrible and painful blinding disease. The World Health Organization has set the goal of eliminating the disease by 2020. Unless momentum is soon gained in Australia, there is a very real risk that Australia will be the last country on earth where blinding trachoma remains. The importance of trachoma in the overall context of Indigenous health is constantly debated. We set out to evaluate the SAFE strategy, including the impact of a swimming pool. However the project soon changed course. This thesis shows that trachoma is still a major public health concern and a cause of significant visual morbidity. This thesis demonstrates that the A and F components of the SAFE strategy can be an effective intervention. This thesis reports on some of the barriers that are impeding the widespread implementation of SAFE within the Northern Territory of Australia.

When high-accuracy positioning is undertaken, the atmospheric delays at the rover need to be accurately estimated. This enables the ambiguity fixing that in turn allows centimetre level positioning. In order to obtain the necessary accuracy in the atmospheric delays a relatively dense network of reference stations is required. The cost of installing and maintaining such a network is significant; and, in the case of sparsely populated areas, can be economically unviable. It would be desirable, therefore, to construct an alternative processing technique that is capable of achieving the necessary ambiguity fixing with a sparser reference network. Such an advance would not only reduce the cost of installing and maintaining reference networks, but would improve the performance of existing networks. Current techniques use a double differenced approach. This suffers from a variety of disadvantages which decrease the accuracy of the atmospheric delay estimates.  This thesis proposes an undifferenced approach, which will not suffer from the same disadvantages. Such a methodology requires more rigorous a priori modelling, as no errors are cancelled out. Many effects that do not need to be estimated in double differenced processing, such as phase hardware delays, are crucial to the accurate estimation of atmospheric effects using the proposed technique.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/2807</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/2807</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Implementing critical inquiry in arts responding classes: studies of teaching strategies whilst studying contemporary artworks</field><field name="creator">Hogan,  Marie</field><field name="description">This study investigates one teacher&#8217;s strategies and use of critical inquiry skills whilst teaching a senior art class about contemporary artworks.

The research focuses specifically on ESL literacy learners with limited or no formal education who are characterised as having literacy needs.  Non-language outcomes (NLO) such as improved self-esteem, cultural awareness and the development of learning-to-learn skills are seen by many teachers to be important gains from language and literacy courses. However, since the introduction of competency-based credentials like the CGEA, many practitioners are concerned that these do not acknowledge NLO. Using the theoretical framework of a previous study by Jackson (1994) into NLO categories, this thesis reported on the findings of a qualitative multi-case study of six teachers and their low-level ESL literacy learners. A range of data including teacher interviews, classroom observations and field notes was used to examine the informants&#8217; conceptualisation of both ESL literacy learner characteristics and of NLO. The teachers were also asked to comment on whether NLO were documented in the CGEA. The data revealed that the informants&#8217; characterisation of ESL literacy learners matches current definitions found in the literature. The teachers reported that these learners do make non-language gains, particularly in the affective and learning skills categories.

It draws upon critiques of the genre of the traditional Bildungsroman to further contribute to the conceptualisation of a related genre, the ethnic bildungsroman. In applying an interdisciplinary approach, the thesis critically analyses the processes of ethnic identity formation in these Italian Australian narratives in various socio-historical and literary contexts, with particular reference to the intersection of gender and ethnicity. It is argued that not only can the development of individual protagonists&#8217; identities be read in each text, but the narratives selected here chart the journeys of ethnic identification made by Italian Australian protagonists and the varying trends in their modes of identification. This study focuses upon a selection of fiction, biography and autobiography that narrates these identities. These narratives both directly and indirectly address experiences of being of Italian heritage in Australia at various times throughout the twentieth century. It argues that the narrative representation and, more importantly, the narrative self-representation of ethnic identities are integral parts of migration and settlement processes, as well as significant steps in opening up dialogues amongst and between various Australian identities.

A critical underlying assumption of the performance-based philosophy is that performance can be predicted with reasonable accuracy and consistency. Development of improved performance prediction technologies, for light-frame structures, requires a detailed understanding of the structural behaviour of light-frame buildings, as well as the environmental loadings to which they are subjected during their lifetime. Full-scale structural testing in the laboratory, combined with analytical modelling, are essential in obtaining this understanding. This thesis presents the results of experimental and analytical investigations into the performance of light-frame structures under lateral loading. The specific objectives of this research are to:1)develop simple, experimentally validated numerical models of light-Frame structures, which can be used to predict their performance under lateral loads, particularly seismic loads; and 2) collect experimental data suitable for validation of detailed finite-element models of light-frame structures.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">wooden-frame houses, design and construction, standards, lateral loads</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.infodiv.unimelb.edu.au/00004166/01/Paevere_PhDThesis.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/2184</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Federal governance in the European Union</field><field name="creator">Annett, Dr Iona</field><field name="description">Since the signing of the Treaty of Paris in 1951, the European Union has emerged from a limited economic confederation to a supranational federal polity. There is, however, little work based in federal theory that seeks to understand the European Union as a federation nor the process by which that was achieved. Federal theory gives us two means of understanding federal government &#8211; federalism as techne and as telos. Federalism as techne informs us of the institutions and structures involved in federal governance. Federalism as telos provides the ideas, norms and values of federalism. Thus it is possible to speak of the federal idea (telos) and the institutions that embody it (techne).The process of federalisation of the European Union has seen the separation of these strands. Federal ideas do not necessarily lead to federal governance regimes; federal governance outcomes are not necessarily based on federal ideas. The European Union has adopted, over time, federal governance structures due to pragmatic concerns with institutional efficiency, bargain implementation, defection from agreement, and the equality of member states. The institutions created by the member states have themselves contributed to the federalisation process.

The evolution of this family has been controversial; points of contention include the existence of an invertebrate relaxin and the absence of a ruminant relaxin.  Using the known members of the relaxin peptide family, all available vertebrate and invertebrate genomes were searched for relaxin peptide sequences.  Contrary to previous reports an invertebrate relaxin was not found; sequence similarity searches indicate the family emerged during early vertebrate evolution.  Phylogenetic analyses revealed the presence of potential relaxin-3, relaxin and INSL5 homologs in fish; dating their emergence far earlier than previously believed.  Furthermore, estimates of mutation rates suggested that the expansion of the family (i.e. the emergence of INSL6, INSL4 and relaxin-1) during mammalia was driven by positive Darwinian selection.  In contrast, relaxin-3 is constrained by strong purifying selection, implying a highly conserved function.

It arises from my involvement with a local ex-refugee Hmong community, who asked me a few years ago to assist in an ongoing standardization project; working first on orthography establishment, then moving on to dictionary work. This work has led me to consider what directs the phenomenon, the goals and the procedures of standardization. An intricate web of ideologies, intergroup relations, linguistic considerations and practical requirements motivate and shape the course it follows. Speakers and researchers, the minority community and the dominant culture all influence its processes and outcomes. For my primary Hmong consultancy group, a strong socio-politico-religious position leads the standardization agenda, manifested particularly in the choice of a unique script. Throughout the wider Hmong community, values including orthodoxy, progressivism and nationism interact with communicative, pedagogical, scientific and technological imperatives, as well as the broader context of recent relocation to a western environment. This complex of conditions informs the salient problems and directions discussed. My approach comprises (i) a descriptive linguistic and sociolinguistic assessment of how particular aspects of language are treated in standardisation, and (ii) a post-Foucauldian investigation of how the processes of standardization are given form as possible objects of thought, discussion or action.

Drama is often used as a pedagogical tool to assist people to develop their communication skills. Dramatic portrayals however, can reinforce rather than challenge limiting stereotypes, and there is the potential for learning through drama to contribute to a patronising world-view and lead to the assumption that a set of formulaic approaches can bridge the communication divide. There is thus a need for research that engages both theoretically and technically with the use of drama as a tool for applied learning. In this thesis, a reflective practitioner methodology is used to explore the use of drama as a method in participatory enquiry and as a tool in the professional education of teachers and doctors. Use of the practitioner perspective permits analysis of the alignment between theory and practice. The Learning Partnerships project provides the context within which to conduct this enquiry. In this project the researcher leads drama workshops that bring together classes of school students and tertiary students completing their studies in medicine or education. The adolescents work as co-investigators with the teachers and doctors, exploring how to communicate effectively in the institutional contexts of schools and clinics.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">drama education, teacher education, medical education, youth participation, participatory action research, reflective practitioner research, emancipatory pedagogy,  poststructuralist theory, youth identity, role-play, communication training</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/2461</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/2461</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The choice agenda and the geography of housing for people with intellectual disabilities</field><field name="creator">Vizel, Ilan</field><field name="description">The notion of choice is emerging as fundamental to new approaches to the provision of housing for people with intellectual disabilities.

During his lifetime, science was undergoing a major transition from mechanistic to dynamical modes of explanation. Coleridge's views on natural philosophy reflect this change. As a young man, in the mid-1790s, he embraced the mechanistic philosophy of Necessitarianism, especially in his psychology. In the early 1800s, however, he began to condemn the ideas to which he had previously been attracted. While there were technical, philosophical and religious reasons for this turnabout, there were also major political ones. For he repeatedly complained that the prevailing 'mechanical philosophy' of the period bolstered emerging liberal and Utilitarian philosophies based ultimately on self-interest. To combat the 'commercial' ideology of early nineteenth century Britain, he accordingly advocated an alternative, 'dynamic' view of nature, derived from German Idealism. I argue that Coleridge championed this 'dynamic philosophy' because it sustained his own conservative politics, grounded ultimately on the view that states possess an intrinsic unity, so are not the product of individualistic self-interest.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Samuel Taylor Coleridge, natural philosophy, science, Romanticism, Necessitarianism, dynamicism, mechanical philosophy, conservatism, German, 1790, 1800s</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.infodiv.unimelb.edu.au/00000664/10/664complete.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/2866</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The relationship between team communication and R&amp;D project performance: a five factor model of team communication</field><field name="creator">Hirst,  Giles</field><field name="description">While the importance of sound communication for achieving excellent research and development (R&amp;D) performance is widely recognised, previous research has not identified which aspects of team communication are most important for effective project performance.

This technique has enabled the complete characterization of the oligomer distributions of very small samples of surfactants (typically 0.1 &#181;g to 0.5 &#181;g).  It has made possible the determination of changes in the oligomer distribution on adsorption of surfactant at the solid/aqueous interface.  Isotherms have been measured for the adsorption of a series of polyoxyethylene nonylphenol surfactants from aqueous solution on to various solids. These isotherms indicate that the surfactant &#8211; surface interaction increases with an increase in the hydrophobicity of the adsorbent. They also show a dependence upon the average length of the ethylene oxide chain and the ratio of the surface area/solution volume. These latter factors affect both the total partition of surfactant between the surface and the solution, and also the selectivity of the solid surface. A detailed study of the adsorption of N8 (a commercial non-ionic surfactant) by a precipitated silica at various surface area/solution ratios, has been undertaken, where the equilibrium surfactant oligomer distributions in the adsorbed and solution phases have been determined. At surfactant concentrations above the critical micelle concentration, the phase separation approach has been used to estimate the surfactant oligomer distributions in free monomer solution and in micelles. This information has been combined with a surface phase model to interpret the results of the adsorption distribution studies.</field><field name="date">1987</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">surface-active agents</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/2867</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/2867</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of a tree delineation algorithm for application to high spatial resolution digital imagery of Australian native forest</field><field name="creator">Culvenor, Darius Samuel</field><field name="description">The automated Tree Identification and Delineation Algorithm (TIDA) was developed for application to high spatial resolution digital imagery of Australian native eucalypt forest.

For example, the existing procedures to estimate pipeline pressure drop during low-velocity pneumatic conveying still are inaccurate and inefficient. For this reason, this thesis aims at developing a pressure prediction model that is a function of the physical properties of the material, pipeline configuration and conveying condition.During low-velocity pneumatic conveying, particles are conveyed usually in the form of slugs. This thesis studies initially the pressure drop across a single particle slug and the stress state and distribution in the slug through theoretical analysis.To obtain detailed information on low-velocity pneumatic conveying, a test rig is set up and four types of coarse granular material are conveyed in the rig. Major parameters such as mass flow-rate of air and solids, pipeline pressure, slug velocity and wall pressure, etc. are measured over a wide range of low-velocity conveying conditions.Based on the experimental results and a dimensional analysis, the relationship between the slug velocity and superficial air velocity is established in terms of the physical properties of the material and pipe size. Also by using particulate mechanics, a semi-empirical correlation is developed to determine the stress transmission coefficient for the slugs flowing in the pipe with rigid and parallel walls. A model then is developed to predict the overall horizontal pipeline pressure drop of low-velocity pneumatic conveying.This model is used to predict the pneumatic conveying characteristics and static air pressure distribution for different test rig pipelines and materials. Good agreement is obtained between the predicted and experimental results. Based on the developed model, a method for determining the economical operating point in low-velocity pneumatic conveying is presented.Additional experimental results from the conveying of semolina show that the performance of fine powders is quite different in low velocity. Based on these experimental results, an appropriate modification to the model is made so that it can be applied to the prediction of pressure drop in low-velocity pneumatic conveying of fine powders.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/830</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Bioactive molluscan resources  and  their conservation:  biological and chemical studies on the egg masses of marine molluscs</field><field name="creator">Benkendorff, Kirsten</field><field name="description">Chemical prospecting for pharmaceuticals in natural organisms (bioprospecting) can be used as a tool for the conservation of biological diversity. However, bioprospecting can only be considered compatible with conservation if it is conducted in an environmentally sustainable manner. In order to prevent the overcollection of vulnerable organisms it is essential to gain an understanding of the local distribution and abundance of the target organisms. In this study, the egg masses of intertidal molluscs were targeted as a novel source of biologically active compounds. Surveys of the molluscan fauna were conducted on 13 intertidal reefs along the Wollongong Coast, New South Wales, Australia. In total, 161 species of intertidal molluscs were found and the benthic egg masses from 47 species were identified. Only 31% of these molluscs have been previously recorded from intertidal surveys in the region and 66% of the species may be regarded as regionally rare. Repeated surveys of the 13 reefs revealed that the species diversity recorded in a single inventory was representative of the cumulative diversity detected. &#8216;Hotspots&#8217; of molluscan diversity were found on the northern side of two large headlands (Bass Point and Bellambi Point), which are characterised by a high habitat complexity and shelter from strong wave action.   Three selective pressures could potentially lead to the evolution of chemical defence in molluscan egg masses: predation, disease and surface fouling. Marine molluscs may rely on a range of alternative strategies to protect their egg masses from predators, including physical protection in leathery egg capsules, camouflage and rapid embryonic development, as well as behavioural mechanisms, such as brooding and the deposition of large aggregated egg masses. Predator feeding trials provided evidence of chemical defence in five out of eight species that were tested. On the other hand, observational studies provided no evidence to suggest that molluscan egg masses are chemically defended against surface fouling by macroorganisms. A range of macrophytes and epizooites were observed on the surface of both gelatinous egg masses and leathery egg capsules. Nevertheless, the overall incidence of fouling was low, probably because of their ephemeral nature and the fact that most molluscs deposit egg masses on the underside of boulders.   Disease appears to be a significant selective pressure leading to the evolution of chemical defence in molluscan egg masses. Two assays were used to screen the egg masses of marine molluscs for antimicrobial activity against human and marine pathogens; a modified version of the traditional Zone of Inhibition assay and the Fluorescein Diacetate assay. These two assays have small sample requirements and thus it was possible to screen the egg masses of 42 molluscs and four polychaetes. Antimicrobial activity against at least one human pathogen was found in the egg masses of 36 species, including two polychaetes and a wide range of molluscs. The egg masses from a number of species clearly lose activity during embryonic development. The antimicrobial activity also appears to be greater in the internal matrix, rather than on the outer surfaces of molluscan egg masses. Surface bacteria could be responsible for the observed activity in some species but are unlikely to be the source of antimicrobial agents in leathery egg capsules, or the gelatinous egg ribbons of Aplysia spp. The egg masses of Dicathais orbita and Aplysia juliana were found to inhibit ecologically significant marine bacteria, as well as Gram negative and Gram positive human pathogenic bacteria and the yeast Candida albicans.  The compounds responsible for the antimicrobial activity in the egg masses of the common muricid Dicathais orbita were isolated using bioassay-guided fractionation. These were then identified by mass spectrometry and proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Three antimicrobial compounds were characterised (tyrindoleninone, tyriverdin and 6-bromoisatin) and these are all known precursors to the ancient dye Tyrian Purple. Tyrindoleninone is the most abundant volatile organic compound found in the fresh eggs and this compound was shown to be toxic to bacteria at a concentration of 1mg/ml. As the eggs develop, most of the tyrindoleninone is converted into tyriverdin, which was found to be effectively bacteriostatic at 0. 5 &#181;g/ml but was not cytotoxic at 1 mg/ml. This compound is considered to be a useful new drug lead. The 6-bromoisatin, which is likely to be an oxidative artefact derived from the other precursors, exhibited mild cytolytic activity against a range of bacteria. As the larvae began hatching, most of the tyriverdin was converted into Tyrian Purple in the egg masses. Tyrian Purple did not exhibit any significant antimicrobial activity, although it is highly insoluble in aqueous media. Nevertheless, these studies provide evidence for a chemical ripening process in the egg masses of Dicathais orbita, which may provide a means of avoiding autotoxicity to the larvae during hatching.  Extracts from the egg masses of 23 molluscs were then examined for the precursors of Tyrian Purple, as well as other potential antimicrobial agents, using gas chromatography/ mass spectrometry. The egg masses from six species of Muricidae were found to contain the precursors of Tyrian Purple. However, these compounds were not found in the egg masses of species from any other family. A range of other related indoles, as well as di- and tribromoimidazoles/pyrazoles were also found in the egg masses of the Muricidae. Most of these compounds have not been previously described from a natural source and they could all contribute to the observed antimicrobial activity in the muricid egg masses. The egg masses of the Aplysiidae were found to contain some bioactive polychlorinated hydrocarbons and a range of long chain unsaturated fatty acids. Halogenated compounds were not found in the egg masses of any other species, although fatty acids could be partly responsible for the observed antimicrobial activity in most of the gelatinous egg masses. A high diversity of volatile organic compounds was found in the molluscan egg masses, but further work is required to identify the active components.  Clearly, bioprospecting can contribute to conservation through the development of comprehensive species inventories. Bioprospecting can be conducted with minimal impact on the environment and the discovery of novel bioactive compounds provides an incentive for conservation. All marine molluscs that deposit benthic egg masses have potential pharmaceutical value and therefore an effort should be made to conserve both them and their natural habitats. Bass Point would be an appropriate site for an intertidal protected area in the Wollongong region.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/278</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Alpha-2-Macroglobulin: an abundant extracellular chaperone</field><field name="creator">French, Katie</field><field name="description">Alpha-2-macroglobulin (&#945;2M) is a 720 kDa glycoprotein consisting of four identical (180 kDa) subunits and is the major representative of the &#945;-macroglobulin group of plasma proteins, present at high concentrations in human plasma.&#61472;&#945;2M is best known for its ability to inhibit a broad spectrum of proteases which it accomplishes using a unique &#8220;trapping&#8221; method. Protease trapping induces &#945;2M to adopt an activated conformation which exposes a binding site for the low density lipoprotein receptor (LRP), facilitating clearance of the complexes from the body. &#945;2M has been ascribed many biological roles which extend beyond simple protease inhibition including immune regulation, mediation of the inflammatory response via cytokine binding and more recently chaperone activity. &#945;2M has been shown to inhibit the heat-induced precipitation of proteins in vitro through the formation of stable complexes. The work outlined in this study further characterises the chaperone activity of &#945;2M under conditions of heat and oxidative stress and establishes the relationship between this and its role as a protease inhibitor. When present at physiological concentrations, &#945;2M was found to inhibit the oxidation-induced precipitation of lysozyme (lys). In a preliminary study, it was shown that &#945;2M forms stable, soluble complexes with heat-stressed proteins. In the current study, native agarose gel electrophoresis and immunoprecipitation analyses were used to demonstrate that &#945;2M also forms stable, soluble complexes with oxidised proteins. Removal of &#945;2M from human plasma was found to significantly increase the level of plasma protein precipitation under conditions of heat and oxidative stress. Proteins co-purifying with &#945;2M from human plasma (following incubation at either 43 &#176;C or room temperature for 72 h) were analysed by mass spectrometry; this identified fibrinogen as a putative endogenous chaperone client protein of &#945;2M. It was also shown that protease-mediated activation of &#61537;2M abolishes the chaperone activity, but that native &#61537;2M is able to form soluble complexes with heat stressed proteins and then subsequently become activated by protease trapping. Oxidation of (chaperone-inactive) protease bound &#945;2M was shown to restore chaperone activity but not the protease inhibitor function.  These behaviours provide an alternative means for generating &#61537;2M/stressed protein/protease complexes which could be cleared in vivo by LRP-mediated cellular uptake and degradation.The ability of &#945;2M/stressed protein complexes to bind to cell surface receptors was investigated using JEG-3, Hep-G2, and U937 cell lines and granulocytes derived from whole human blood. &#945;2M/CS complexes had limited ability to bind to LRP expressed on the surface of JEG-3 cells. However, preliminary results indicated that activation of &#945;2M (&#945;2M*) and &#945;2M/stressed protein complexes (&#945;2M*/CS) with trypsin resulted in subsequent binding to the surface of JEG-3 cells. Native &#945;2M/CS complexes were found to bind to granulocytes and Hep-G2 cells via unidentified, non-LRP receptors. Collectively, the results presented here further establish &#945;2M as a potent extracellular chaperone with the ability to protect proteins from heat and oxidation-induced stress. &#945;2M appears likely to have a dual role in vivo, as a protease inhibitor and as an extracellular chaperone, the first identified mammalian protein with both activities. The evidence suggests that it may function as part of an extracellular quality control system for protein folding important in the control of inflammation and protein conformational disorders (PCDs) such as Alzheimer's disease and type II diabetes. The pathology of PCDs has been linked to the development of extracellular deposits of misfolded proteins. This thesis provides evidence supporting the hypothesis that &#945;2M binds to misfolded extracellular proteins to keep them soluble and mediates their cellular uptake and subsequent degradation. Future advances in understanding of extracellular protein folding quality control are likely to provide novel insights into the mechanisms underpinning the development of serious human diseases and identify opportunities for the development of new therapies.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/114</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Phytoplankton diversity and ecology in estuaries of southeastern NSW, Australia</field><field name="creator">Liu, Dongyan</field><field name="description">Phytoplankton, as one of the most important primary producers in aquatic ecosystems, have been widely used to indicate the health of such ecosystems, but they are a poorly understood component of coastal plant communities in Australia. The primary objective of this study was to address a number of gaps in the current knowledge of phytoplankton in the estuaries of southeastern Australia.An extensive literature review on phytoplankton diversity and ecology in the estuaries of Australia was conducted to identify knowledge gaps. There are more than 130 estuaries in New South Wales, Australia (NSW), but almost no single set of comprehensive information on phytoplankton taxonomy has been established, and very few studies on the seasonal and annual patterns of phytoplankton distribution have been carried out. The thresholds or standards to assess the changes of aquatic environments using phytoplankton are therefore difficult to establish, even though an increasing number of bloom events indicates an urgent need to monitor the dynamics of phytoplankton assemblages. Thus, seven representative estuaries, which cover about 400 km of the southeastern NSW coast, were chosen for study of the general characteristics of phytoplankton diversity and ecology. A more detailed comparative study of the phytoplankton assemblages in two lakes with different nutrient status and a historical study of environmental change using diatom frustules in sediments of one lake as indicators were also completed. In addition, the growth of key species was studied to explore the governing environmental factors.In the seven estuaries, 145 phytoplankton species were identified, covering five groups - Cyanophyta, Chlorophyta, Chromophyta, Diatom and Pyrrophyta. Diatom and Pyrrophyta species were the main contributors to the phytoplankton diversity.  Phytoplankton assemblages were characterized by a large number of temperate water species combined with a smaller number of warm water species, reflecting the warm temperate climate in the studied areas. The proportions of brackish and freshwater to brackish species corresponded to the gradient of salinity in the estuaries. A combination of euplanktonic, tychoplanktonic, epiphytic and periphytic species was observed in the phytoplankton assemblages, which was related to specific estuarine habitats. The seasonal patterns of phytoplankton biomass displayed winter or spring maxima, and a positive relationship with the nutrient levels in the studied estuaries. The horizontal distribution of phytoplankton assemblages within each lake can be significantly impacted by seagrass beds or large freshwater discharges caused.A more detailed comparison of the phytoplankton assemblages between a heavily impacted lake (Lake Illawarra) and a less impacted lake (Burrill Lake), was completed, based on the bimonthly observations from April 2005 to April 2007. Lake Illawarra displayed higher DIN and DIP concentrations compared to Burrill Lake, particularly the DIP concentration. The former was characterized by a marked N-limitation condition, while the later displayed variable DIN:DIP ratios. Diatoms were the main dominant species in Lake Illawarra, combined with a limited dinoflagellate dominance in some seasons. In contrast, dinoflagellates dominated in Burrill Lake in most seasons. The proportion of toxic and red tide species in Burrill Lake was notably higher compared to Lake Illawarra. The different nutrient ratios between the two lakes were regarded as an important controlling factor. The seasonal succession of phytoplankton in the two lakes did not completely follow a spring maximum that is generally observed in temperate waters. In Burrill Lake, phytoplankton biomass increased from autumn and reached the maximum in winter, while the maxima in Lake Illawarra could occur in autumn, winter and spring. Factors influencing the seasonal maximum include nutrient concentrations and ratios, temperate and grazing pressure. In addition, seagrass beds significantly impacted the horizontal distribution of phytoplankton assemblages within lakes.Long-term environmental changes that have occurred in Lake Illawarra were investigated using dated (210Pb and 137Cs) sediment core studies. The diatom frustules deposited in the sediment post-World War II were analyzed along with the chronology.  The results indicated that significant changes had occurred in the phytoplankton communities in the lake over the past 60 years. There was evidence of increasing eutrophication through changes in diatom concentrations and the ratio of planktonic:benthic diatoms, and also of increasing salinity supported by the development of marine planktonic diatoms and a decrease of freshwater and brackish water species.Growth characteristics of two key phytoplankton species, Prorocentrum lima and Thalassionema nitzschioides isolated from Lake Illawarra, representing key dinoflagellate and diatom species, respectively, were studied. Their life strategies under the different nutrient and temperature conditions were compared. P. lima displayed a higher temperature preference and greater nutrient demand in contrast to Th. nitzschioides with a lower temperature preference and nutrient demand.  N-limitation can significantly impact the growth of P. lima because of its K-strategy preferring to utilize all available nutrients in a short time, and then ceasing growth.  The growth of Th. nitzschioides displayed less impact under N-limitation because of the preferred r-strategy which uses the nutrient in a more sustainable manner. In competitive experiments, P. lima displayed a great dominance in the f/2 enriched medium compared to the Th. nitzschioides at both 18 and 25&#186;C. In the N-limitation condition, Th. nitzschioides displayed dominance at 18&#186;C. Two explanations are suggested to explain these results. One is that the different strategies of two species to the nutrient uptake and temperature preference played important roles in determining their competitive ability. The other is that an allelopathic substance reported to be produced by P. lima could inhibit the growth of Th. nitzschioides.This research has provided important new information to assist understanding the characteristics of phytoplankton assemblages in estuaries of southeastern NSW. The indicative role of phytoplankton in estuaries was assessed and linked to the relevant physical and chemical factors, human activities and climate change. The need for further research and the application of phytoplankton studies in the environmental management has also been highlighted.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/827</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">TOTALLY DIFFERENT: 
AN ETHNOGRAPHIC ACCOUNT OF 
INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY NURSING</field><field name="creator">Paech, Susan Elisabeth</field><field name="description">This study adopted an ethnographic approach to examine the role of the Registered Nurse (RN) in the intellectual disability sector. The research setting (The Centre) is a residential facility for clients with intellectual disability in the northern suburbs of Adelaide that opened in 1971 and was similar to a hospital with the same hierarchy of nursing. Mental deficiency nurse training was conducted there until the 1990s but that qualification is no longer recognised. The Centre is under the umbrella of a large state disability organisation that is in the process of moving clients of the service from institutions (the Centre) to community living options such as group homes. 

The cessation of mental deficiency nurse training and the introduction of deinstitutionalisation were considered to impact on client health and in the late 1990s a 24 hour nursing service was commenced. There was strong anecdotal evidence the service should be evaluated. A review of the literature found some research had been conducted in overseas countries with a focus on deinstitutionalisation but with a paucity of interest in the role of the RN, particularly in Australia.

Ethnography, first used in anthropology as a way of describing different cultures, was chosen as the research methodology because the researcher wanted to discover how the culture influenced the role of the RN. The researcher is  an RN employed in the area. As an ethnographer and participant observer, the researcher became the data collection instrument. The entire culture is considered to be the sample in ethnography and data took the form of hundreds of hours of field note entries and interview transcripts. 

Following analysis, the findings were presented in themes answering the research question which was in two parts. The first &#145;from the perspective of the nurse, client and other health care professionals, what constitutes intellectual disability nursing?&#146; and secondly &#145;what are the every day rituals, norms and patterns within the disability culture that shape and influence disability nursing for the Registered Nurse?&#146;. 

&#145;Caring for the client who is institutionalised&#146;, &#145;The RN in the disability sector having certain qualities&#146;, &#145;Working within a different paradigm&#146;, &#145;Having to assume responsibility for large numbers of unregulated workers&#146;, &#145;Having to work alongside many professional groups&#146; and &#145;Having different educational needs&#146; are themes which describe the role. Themes describe the diversity of the role and in describing the registered intellectual disability nurse as &#145;different&#146; the role is compared with that of the nurse in other settings. The current research revealed there is a need for more health related education for unregulated workers and specific intellectual disability education for registered and enrolled nurses. 

Themes that answer the second part of the research question are &#145;hierarchical structure&#146;, &#145;the Registered Nurse's position&#146; and &#145;role confusion&#146;. The non-nursing management at the top of the hierarchical ladder was found to significantly limit the role of the RN who was afforded no opportunity for leadership. Confusion over the RN's role and indeed individual workers' roles was observed at all levels. Findings suggest much stronger nursing leadership is required to provide advocacy and holistic care for the client and education for the carer. An outcome of the current research was the development of a model for intellectual disability nursing (see Table 8-1).</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Intellectual Disability</field><field name="subject">Nursing</field><field name="subject">ethnography</field><field name="subject">Leadership</field><field name="subject">Disability Nursing</field><field name="subject">Holistic Care</field><field name="identifier">http://catalogue.flinders.edu.au./local/adt/public/adt-SFU20090918.161221</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Karl Rahner and the Option of Grace in Freedom: A critical examination of Rahner's understanding of both fundamental option and virtue ethics and the link between them in the light of their classical antecedents and contemporary developments in moral theology, moral philosophy and fundamental theology</field><field name="creator">Warner, James Jonathan</field><field name="description">1 Aim of this Thesis. The aim of this thesis is to critically examine the understanding of the relationship between fundamental option and virtue ethics in the work of Karl Rahner. This is done in the light of: both the classical heritage of virtue ethics and its contemporary recovery in post modernity: both the pre-history of the fundamental option and the contemporary issues of post modernity surrounding it. The work of Karl Rahner has been chosen as the subject of this thesis because, first, as the pre-eminent post-conciliar Catholic theologian, he developed the leading theory of fundamental option based on fundamental freedom, and second, as a self confessed Thomist, he also included virtue theory within his theology. These two traditions in moral theology, of virtue theory and fundamental option theory, have not only developed in relative mutual isolation (the former largely confined to the English speaking world, the latter a product of continental moral theology) but they have also been seen in some quarters as irreconcilable. This thesis uses the example of Karl Rahner to provide a bridgehead between these two distanced ethical theories. The example of the reconciliation of these two traditions in the work of Karl Rahner will be pursued in the setting of postmodernity. This provides the opportunity to assess the continuing significance of the theology of Karl Rahner. 2 The Scope of the Thesis. The thesis begins by stating the problem under examination, that is, that there has been no sustained analysis of the link between virtue ethics and fundamental option in the work of Karl Rahner (or any other contemporary moral theologian). The setting for this thesis topic is briefly considered. First, the setting of postmodernity is examined and then second, the profound impact of the Second Vatican Council on contemporary moral theology is examined, in particular with regard to the development of the perspective of moral agency. In order to establish the link between virtue ethics and fundamental option, an understanding of these two approaches per se is developed, beginning with the precursors of fundamental option (in particular, the approach of Aquinas) and then the recovery of virtue and its classical antecedents, (in particular, Aristotle and Aquinas). Both these concerns have been influenced by the shift in moral theory from moral act to moral agency, with a concern for the moral dimension of the psychology and communitarian perspective of the human person. Attention is also given to the role of passions and the hexis/habitus controversy in virtue theory insofar as they impinge on the understanding of freedom in fundamental option. This general setting of the history of Christian ethics is then given a narrower focus with the work of Karl Rahner. Various aspects of his thought are examined, in particular his intellectual heritage, his transcendental anthropology, and his perspectives on moral theology. The focus is narrowed further to particular components of his theology, viz. his understanding of fundamental option, fundamental freedom, Ignatian mysticism, supernatural existential, virtue ethics, theology of grace and metaphysics of knowledge. The Rahnerian understanding of virtue ethics and fundamental option is considered further with regard to the issues raised in the contemporary debate on these subjects. His metaphysics of knowledge is also considered in relation to the contemporary concern of virtue epistemology and the rediscovery of metaphysics. The link between fundamental option and virtue ethics in the work of Karl Rahner is examined with reference to antecedents in Aquinas et alii and contemporary minimalist approaches. 3 Conclusions. Despite the fact that there is no systematic treatment of either fundamental option or virtue ethics in the Foundations of Christian Faith (Rahner's most systematic work) and further, that Rahner seemed unaware of the recovery of virtue ethics, it has been possible to establish in Rahner's work a link between fundamental option and virtue. The link is explicitly embedded in an an obscure way in diverse works but it is more importantly and implicitly preeminently dependent on the theological virtues. For example, faith is the exercise of a fundamental option for or against God, not a process of categorical choice or habit, but a state of fundamental freedom. What stands behind the exercise of faith, and the other theological virtues of hope and love are all the components of his transcendental anthropology, viz. fundamental freedom, supernatural existential, grace and metaphysic of knowledge. They all have as their terminus the virtue of faith, that is belief with absolute assent. Rahner also gives centrality to the virtues of hope and love. The three theological virtues are the three basic perfections of Christian existence which abide and last. They are interrelated, distinguishable yet possess a unity and condition one another. The theological virtues vis-a-vis the fundamental option are pre-eminent, have unity in diversity and are linked intimately with both the supernatural existential and fundamental option in grace and freedom. They are at the centre of Rahner's anthropology even if they are heavily camouflaged. They reflect Rahner's Thomist heritage, they lend themselves, via Rahner's metaphysic of knowledge, to a virtue epistemology, to a recovery of metaphysics and they contribute to a contemporary philosophical psychology in the setting of postmodernity and engagement with the leading concerns of postmodernism.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Grace</field><field name="subject">Freedom</field><field name="subject">Fundamental option</field><field name="subject">Virtue ethics</field><field name="subject">Moral theology</field><field name="subject">Moral philosophy</field><field name="subject">Fundamental theology</field><field name="subject">Karl Rahner</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp221.15092009</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Experience of Six Non-aboriginal Teachers Living and Working in Remote Aboriginal Communities During the 1990's</field><field name="creator">Whiting, Elizabeth</field><field name="description">In Australia, non-Aboriginal people have been involved in Aboriginal education since the end of the 19th century. There has been ongoing criticism of non-Aboriginal involvement in Aboriginal education and a movement towards Aboriginalisation in education. This study addresses the issues faced by six non-Aboriginal teachers in remote Aboriginal communities in the 1990's. The purpose of this study is to explore the experiences and perceptions of non-Aboriginal teachers living and working in remote Aboriginal communities in the 1990's. Through this research I found that the non-Aboriginal teachers faced difficulties living and working in remote Aboriginal communities. They talked about the distinctive lifestyle and living conditions. They reported a need for pre-service and ongoing professional development focusing on aspects influencing their lives. The discussion topics included: their living circumstances; Aboriginal world view; Aboriginal health issues; community issues; Aboriginal teaching and learning styles and school policies. The study is consistent with previous research about non-Aboriginal teachers living and working in remote Aboriginal communities. It argues that pre-service and ongoing professional development is vital for the success of non-Aboriginal teacher in remote communities. Community based educational programs for non-Aboriginal teachers are needed. These programs should include non-Aboriginal teachers learning about Aboriginal culture, Aboriginal learning and teaching styles and the development and implementation of educational policies. These programmes need to include discussion of aspects of living in isolated settings. Schools and governing bodies involved need to develop closer liaison with non-Aboriginal teachers to support their living in this setting. It is also important that policies in place address the problem of the high turnover of non-Aboriginal staff experienced by remote community schools. This study also poses the question what is the future for non-Aboriginal teachers in remote Aboriginal communities? Aboriginalisation in remote Aboriginal communities is highly recommended.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Aboriginal education</field><field name="subject">Remote education</field><field name="subject">Primary school teachers</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp222.15092009</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Managing risk : a case study of a non-government organisation that provides long-term care and support services for people with mental, intellectual and physical disabilities : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Management at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Mohammed, Kassim M.</field><field name="description">This research examines the way employees perceive risk in a non-governmental healthcare organisation that provides care and support for people with mental, intellectual and physical disabilities. Thirty-four respondents from all levels and services within an NGO participated in in-depth semi-structured interviews to explore the meaning of the concept of risk from their own viewpoints, as well as their perspectives regarding types and sources of risk in their work and initiatives for controlling and dealing with such types and sources. This involved discussing the role of training in improving the awareness of employees in minimising risk, and the effect of training on the entire risk management process. Additional information was obtained by the researcher from documentation and personal observation. Themes that emerged from analysing data pointed to the interrelated link between perception and risk. Accordingly, the study found that risk is culturally constructed, individualistic, and subjective. It was evident that risk is a perceptual matter affected by beliefs, feelings, knowledge, culture, image, context, and the experience of people. The culture of fear of risk and of perceiving risk as something purely negative was dominant among the participants, who viewed risk as an unfavourable issue that does not have opportunities, which creates another source of risk &#8211; the risk of perception of risk. This research demonstrates that the perceptual aspect of risk emphasises the central role of people in any risk management process. For effective risk management, all perspectives should be considered. This requires a participatory system of managing risk, improving the awareness of people about risk, and modifying the culture of risk among them. Training has a significant role in the achievement of these fundamentals.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">MASH Trust</field><field name="subject">non-governmental organisations</field><field name="subject">risk management</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">people with disabilities</field><field name="subject">health care organisations</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::360000 Policy and Political Science::360200 Policy and Administration</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/792</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Surveillance for diseases of poultry with specific reference to avian influenza : a dissertation presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy at Massey University</field><field name="creator">Lockhart, Caryl Yolanda</field><field name="description">This thesis addresses issues related to surveillance for disease in commercial and non-commercial poultry populations. The motivation for this work has largely arisen from the unprecedented outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 that have occurred in 52 countries in Asia, Africa and Europe since 2003. A series of studies are presented using data derived from two countries, Vietnam and New Zealand. The two Vietnamese studies provide in-depth epidemiological analyses of the outbreak of HPAI H5N1 from December 2003 to March 2004. The three New Zealand studies deal with issues related to the development of effective surveillance strategies for HPAI &#8212; informed both directly and indirectly by the findings from the Vietnamese studies. This approach provides an example of how &#8216;lessons&#8217; learnt from countries that have experienced large scale infectious disease epidemics can be used to assist in the design of surveillance activities in (as yet) unaffected countries. The descriptive analyses of the 2003 &#8211; 2004 outbreak of HPAI H5N1 in Vietnam indicate that the epidemic was seeded simultaneously in the north and south of the country in the later part of 2003 with 87% of provinces affected by February 2004. HPAI risk was concentrated around the Mekong and Red River Deltas. The broad scale spatial distribution of disease is likely to have been associated with regional differences in the poultry farming, trade in poultry, and environmental conditions such as the presence of bodies of water which would support reservoir species for the virus. A Bayesian zero-inflated Poisson regression model was used to quantify the influence of environmental and demographic factors on the spatial distribution of HPAI positive communes. In areas where disease was reported, our results show that HPAI risk was positively associated with the presence of irrigation and negatively associated with elevation. After controlling for these fixed effects, a single large area of elevated risk in the Red River Delta area was identified, presumably arising from similarities in the likelihood of reporting disease or the presence of factors increasing disease transmission and spread. Further investigations to elucidate likely transmission mechanisms, targeting this area of the country, would be a profitable area of future research. The second part of this thesis presents three studies that address issues related to the development of effective surveillance strategies for HPAI in New Zealand. The first was a cross-sectional study to enumerate the prevalence of backyard poultry ownership in two areas (one urban and the other rural) close to a large provincial city in the North Island of New Zealand. The prevalence of poultry ownership was 2% (95% CI 1% &#8211; 4%) in the urban area and 19% (95% CI 12% &#8211; 30%) in the rural area. The relatively low numbers of land parcels where poultry are present indicates that these areas, in the event of an infectious disease incursion, would be unlikely to pose a risk for spread of infectious agent. A cross-sectional survey of all members of the Poultry Industry Association of New Zealand was conducted in the later half of 2007. Respondents were asked to document contacts made with other enterprises related to feed, live birds and hatching eggs, table eggs and poultry product, and waste litter and manure. Patterns of contact were analysed using social network analyses. Each of the four networks had scale-free properties, meaning that for each movement type there were small numbers of enterprises that had contacts with large numbers of enterprises (potential &#8216;super-spreaders&#8217; of disease). The presence of an undetected infectious disease in enterprises with super-spreader characteristics increases the likelihood that an epidemic will propagate rapidly through the population, assuming there is a directly proportional relationship between the number of contacts an enterprise makes and the probability that disease will be transferred from one location to another. While the finding that feed suppliers had large numbers of poultry farm contacts in the feed network came as no surprise, what was of greater interest was that there were small numbers of poultry farms that reported off-farm movements of feed. This should serve as an important reminder for disease control authorities: movement (and other) restrictions applied during the course of an animal health emergency should be applied across a range of industry sectors, recognising that some industry participants may practice activities that are not entirely typical for their enterprise type (e.g. poultry farms on-selling feed to other farms). In the absence of perfect and up-to-date network data, knowledge of the characteristics of individual enterprises that render them more likely to be atypical (e.g. size, type, and geographic location) would be of value, since this information could be used to inform a risk based approach to disease surveillance and control. A scenario tree model was developed as an approach for evaluating the effectiveness of New Zealand&#8217;s passive surveillance system for HPAI. The model was developed in two stages. In the first, factors thought to influence the geographic distribution of NAI risk of introduction and spread (and therefore surveillance strategy) were combined to create a spatial risk surface. In the second stage, a scenario tree model of the passive surveillance system for NAI was developed using the spatial risk surface and the HPAI surveillance strategy prescribed by Biosecurity New Zealand. The model was most sensitive to farmers reporting the presence of suspected cases of disease. This implies that the sensitivity of the system as a whole stands to increase if the importance of reporting suspicious clinical signs is reiterated to poultry producers. The studies presented in this thesis have presented a range of techniques and methodological approaches that are sufficiently generic to be used in any country to inform the design of surveillance strategies for a variety of animal diseases, not just those of poultry. Although epidemiology, as a discipline, is endoured with a vast range of analytical techniques that can be used to enhance the understanding of factors influencing the spread of disease among animal populations, the quality of data used to support these techniques is often lacking. The challenge in the years ahead, for both developed and developing countries, is to set in place the appropriate infrastructures to collect details of animal populations consistent in quality over time and space.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">bird flu</field><field name="subject">HPAI H5N1</field><field name="subject">infectious diseases</field><field name="subject">poultry industry</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300500 Veterinary Medicine::300503 Epidemiology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/813</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Shame on who? : experiential and theoretical accounts of the constitution of women's shame within abusive intimate relationships : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Sociology at Massey University</field><field name="creator">Jury, Angela Jean</field><field name="description">This feminist project explores the experiential accounts of twenty-five women who have lived through abuse within their intimate relationships. Their stories, gathered through a series of semi-structured face-to-face interviews intended to elicit accounts of resilience were saturated with emotion-talk, especially shame-talk. To address questions of the relationship between these accounts and theoretical accounts of abuse, and shame the women&#8217;s texts were engaged in an analytic dialogue with feminist knowledges of abuse against women, Erving Goffman&#8217;s sociological understandings of shame, stigma and mortification of the self, Thomas Scheff&#8217;s sociological theory of shame and social bonds, and feminist poststructuralist understandings around the constitution of human subjectivity. These conversations enabled development of a conceptual representation of the special and highly specific form of social bonding experienced by victims of abuse within intimate relationships. This bonding begins with processes of mortification of the self, the gradual erosion of a sense of self through the systematic imposition of various shaming and shameful actions. These processes take place within a specific social context created through the constitutive power of dominant discourses of gender, heterosexual coupledom, matrimony and motherhood which work to shape the lives of individual women. Because of the specific ways in which these discourses currently operate within Aotearoa New Zealand they result in the constitution of a narrow range of tightly prescribed subject positions available to victims of intimate partner abuse. This analysis leads to an argument that women&#8217;s inability to &#8216;do&#8217; motherhood or intimate partnership in line with dominant discourses of mothering and relationships (because these simply cannot be achieved within an abusive context), opens them to the debilitating effects of shame. Shame, both actual and threatened, promotes silence, isolation and dangerous private spaces as women seek to protect themselves from its painful experience. I argue that it is therefore crucial to promote the availability of discursive positioning for women living through abuse which offers non-shaming and realistic choices.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">abused women</field><field name="subject">intimate partner abuse</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">shame</field><field name="subject">stigma</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370100 Sociology::370105 Applied sociology, programme evaluation and social impact assessment</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/874</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">He ara ki te ao m&#257;rama : a pathway to understanding the facilitation of taha wairua in mental health services : a thesis submitted in partial fulfilment of the requirements for a Masters of Arts, Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Ihimaera, Louise</field><field name="description">This research is about the facilitation of taha wairua (spirituality) in mental health services. This research has been guided by kaupapa Maori frameworks and aimed to answer three questions: &#183; Whether taha wairua, supported by matauranga Maori can be verified as a valid concept for use in mental health services &#183; How Maori cultural and clinical workers facilitate taha wairua within a kaupapa Maori approach, and, &#183; How the use and influence of taha wairua facilitates the inclusion of matauranga Maori. The increasing acceptability of alternative and holistic approaches to healing often with a spiritual component deserves serious consideration, especially within the area of mental health services. The literature shows that indigenous views of health and healing are valid and deserve recognition and acceptance in mental health services. The Treaty of Waitangi, the founding document of New Zealand, underpins Maori rights to the facilitation of taha wairua practices in Western health systems. Current New Zealand mental health policy and legislation provide strategies to progress the facilitation of Maori healing interventions in mental health services. It is noticeable, however, that these strategies are not built on the Treaty of Waitangi but are built on health disparities. The literature also supports the concept that there is a place in the recovery process for both spirituality and religious beliefs, and Western and cultural interventions. The data illustrate how tikanga Maori either practised solely in its natural form or within the framework of Maori models of health is beneficial to health outcomes for tangata whai ora and whanau when supported by the facilitation of taha wairua. The research data provided the foundation for components that can produce a framework for the facilitation of the concept of taha wairua within the scopes of practice of kaimahi Maori in mental health services. Some standards for best practice in supporting taha wairua within the cultural component of all Maori working in mental health have also been proposed. Maori do not have the critical mass to achieve all that has been raised in this research, and the principle of collective responsibility needs to be applied to provide the necessary resources and support to achieve implementation of Maori healing frameworks to facilitate taha wairua in mental health services. It is hoped the knowledge gained from this research will be useful to policy makers and managers in gaining insight into the benefits of healing for tangata whaiora, whanau and kaimahi Maori through the provision of appropriate cultural interventions and in providing an appropriate environment to enable physical and spiritual healing to take place. It is also hoped Maori too will find this research of benefit, particularly to inform scopes of practice, thereby providing potential for new ways to achieve best practice cultural and clinical practice.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">Mental health</field><field name="subject">Taha wairua</field><field name="subject">Spirituality</field><field name="subject">Mental health services</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321200 Public Health and Health Services::321204 Mental health</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/990</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Better relationships for better learning : schools addressing Maori achievement through partnership : research thesis submitted as partial fulfillment of a Masters degree in Education at Te Uru Maraurau, Massey University College of Education, Palmerston North</field><field name="creator">McLeod, Jen</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the policy document Better Relationships for Better Learning: Guidelines for Boards of Trustees and Schools on Engaging with M&#228;ori Parents, Whanau, and Communities (Ministry of Education, 2000a).

M&#257;ori women&#8217;s health and wellbeing influences the nature of their health outcomes, varies across their lifetime. &#8216;What is happening for M&#257;ori women, their health and interactions with &#8216;mainstream&#8217; health services?&#8217; is the question that guided the research with M&#257;ori women. A grounded theory informed by a M&#257;ori centred approach was developed that utilised Mason Durie&#8217;s M&#257;ori-centred concepts of mana M&#257;ori (control), whakapiki tangata (enablement) and whakatuia (integration), and integrated Glaserian grounded theory to guide the collection and analysis of the data. Twenty-three women who identified as M&#257;ori within the Te Arawa rohe, and who were between the ages of 18 and 80 years were formally interviewed as either a group, pairs or individuals, with a further 15 informally interviewed during the process of theoretical sampling. Semi-structured interviews and field notes were used to collect the data, and the processes of constant comparative analysis, theoretical sampling and saturation were used to generate a middle-range substantive M&#257;ori centred grounded theory. Three core categories were identified relating to the health and wellbeing of M&#257;ori women: (a) Mana M&#257;ori, which describes what is important for their health and wellbeing; (b) The Way It Is, which outlines the resigned acceptance they have of their reality and life circumstances, and the barriers and challenges that are encountered; and (c) Engaging with Health Services, which describes what they require from &#8216;mainstream&#8217; health services to improve the access and use of these services.

As a result, these transplanted varieties often show traces of the ongoing language contact as specific to their particular context. This thesis explores one such transplanted German language variety &#8211; Springbok- German &#8211; as spoken by a small subset of German Lutherans in South Africa. Specifically, this study takes as its focus eight rural German communities across two South African provinces, KwaZulu-Natal and Mpumalanga, which were founded in the second half of the 19th century.  The study employs a broadly ethnographic approach and integrates participant observation with interviews and (limited) questionnaire data. On the one hand, it addresses issues of language maintenance and shift, and on the other, presents findings from an analysis of grammatical features, that is morphosyntactic and syntactic features, of this particular German language variety.  The thesis explores the domains where speakers continue to make use of German, by discussing practices at home, within the church and community, and at school. It also briefly considers German media consumption. The findings reveal that the home and the church/community constitute the strongholds of German language maintenance, although intermarriage is having an increasing impact on these patterns. Changes in the demographics of the communities, e.g. out-migration of younger speakers and barely any in-migration, are also shown to be detrimental to the continued survival of German in this region. Conceptualising these communities as ethnoreligious ones where (Luther) German functions as a &#8216;sacred variety&#8217; (cf. Fishman, 2006a) helps to account for the prolonged maintenance patterns as exhibited by the communities. The study explores how the communities are shaped by their German Lutheranism and a 19th century understanding of Volkstum, and how this resulted in an insistence on preserving the German language and culture at all costs. This is still transparent today.  This study also seeks to provide new insights into the structure of Springbok- German, and, for this purpose, explores a number of (morpho)syntactic features, including case marking, possessive constructions, word order, and infinitive complements. Although the overall findings indicate that Springbok-German is (still) relatively conservative, there are clear indications of emerging structural changes. While reduction in the case system, for example, is not as advanced as in other transplanted German varieties, the accusative/dative distinction is becoming increasingly blurred. Changes are also apparent in possessive constructions and word order. In this context, the study considers the fundamental question of the role language contact plays in such situations, i.e. whether the respective changes can plausibly be attributed to contact with Afrikaans and/or English, or whether they are best seen as the result of language-internal tendencies. The conclusion follows that it is difficult to ascertain the precise role of external influence vs. internal developments. The developments in Springbok-German are best seen as resulting from a combination of both, shaped furthermore by the social conditions as prevalent in this particular language contact setting.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">German language variety</field><field name="subject">Ethno-religious communities</field><field name="subject">Religion and language</field><field name="subject">Language change</field><field name="subject">Language contact</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.monash.edu.au/hdl/1959.1/68398</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effect of concentration, pH and added chelating agents on the colloidal properties of heated reconstituted skim milk</field><field name="creator">Chandrapala, Janage Jayani Sandamau</field><field name="description">The thermal processing of milk changes the composition and surface properties of the colloidal particles present and alters the physical properties of the milk.  Whilst some changes such as those used to improve the texture of products such as yoghurt and are desirable, others such as gel formation during the manufacture of Ultra-High Temperature milk are highly undesirable.  This work aims to characterize the effects of milk composition and pH on the chemical and physical changes that occur when milk is heated in order to understand and control the effect of thermal processing on the functional properties of the milk. Particularly important are: (i)	the changes to the integrity of the casein micelles and the extent to which they are reversible on cooling of the heated milk, (ii)	the changes to the speciation of the components of the serum as they re-equilibrate in response to the changed environment during heating and on cooling, (iii)	the heat-induced denaturation of the whey proteins, (iv)	the interaction between the components of the micelles and those in the milk serum, particularly those interactions that lead to aggregation or other changes that affect the functional properties of the milk on heating.  This project includes thermal treatment (90&amp;deg;C/10 min) of control skim milk solutions (9% Milk Solids Non Fat) with or without addition of calcium chelating agents (orthophosphate (Pin) &amp; Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)) and concentrated skim milk solutions (up to 21% MSNF). The pH range chosen was 6.2 to 7.2. Almost all of the studies on heat stability to date have been carried out by heating the milk and determining the changes that have occurred after the milk is cooled. This project is focussed on the direct measurements in real time of the changes that occur at the exact temperature. The experimental techniques included pH, calcium activity and 31P NMR measurements at high temperatures to investigate the consequences to the change in mineral speciation, Size Exclusion Chromatography in combination with SDS-PAGE analysis for protein speciation during heating and Diffusing Wave Spectroscopy and viscosity measurements to determine the heat stability of milk systems. pH and calcium activity decreased with increase in temperature for all the milk systems studied. These changes were largely reversible as enough time was given for equilibration. pH and calcium activity changes during heating are a function of milk composition. The quantity, size and the composition of the protein aggregates present in the serum phase after mild centrifugation (~33,000g) of heated (90&amp;deg;C/10min) milk solutions were found to be a function of pH and milk composition (including the consequent differences in speciation of the components of milk). DWS and the viscosity measurements showed that pH at the temperature of heating is one of the primary determinants in influencing the aggregation of the proteins, which led to thermal stability of milk systems.  Hence, changing the milk composition resulted in differences in pH at the temperature of heating, which led to different behaviours of heat stability of milk systems.  Careful control of the composition of milk and thereby the pH at the temperature of heating allows a greater control of thermal stability of milk systems.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Heat treatment</field><field name="subject">pH</field><field name="subject">Chelating agents</field><field name="subject">Milk concentration</field><field name="subject">Soluble aggregates</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.monash.edu.au/hdl/1959.1/74618</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Enteroviral mediated oncolysis of cancer: evaluation of efficacy and obstacles to therapeutic success</field><field name="creator">Haley, Erin</field><field name="description">Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD)</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">oncolytic virus</field><field name="subject">enterovirus</field><field name="subject">cancer</field><field name="subject">gastric</field><field name="subject">colorectal</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1959.13/38508</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A family of higher-rank graphs arising from subshifts</field><field name="creator">Weaver, Natasha</field><field name="description">Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD)</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">operator algebras</field><field name="subject">graph algebras</field><field name="subject">higher-rank graph</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1959.13/38511</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of glass-ionomer cement lining on sealing ability and postoperative tooth sensitivity after resin composite restoration of posterior teeth</field><field name="creator">Banomyong, D.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/3533</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/3533</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Aspects of shrub-grass dynamics on the Bogong High Plains (Subalpine), Victoria</field><field name="creator">Williams, R.

The vegetation of the High Plains consists of woodland, heathland, grassland herbfield and wetland communities. On the better drained sites, the transition from heath dominated communities to grass dominated communities is correlated with gradients of decreasing accumulation and persistence of snow, increasing exposure to wind and low minimum air temperatures, and decreasing steepness and rockiness of terrain. In many areas, shrubs have increased in cover and abundance, especially over the last 50 years. In particular, shrubs have invaded many areas of grassland, which has resulted in an expansion of both open heath and closed heath. The High Plains have been grazed by free ranging cattle each summer since the 1850's, and a primary aim of this thesis is to investigate the dynamics of heathland and grassland, and the impact that cattle grazing has upon these two vegetation types.</field><field name="date">1985</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">shrub, grass, shrub-grass, Bogong, High Plains, Bogong High Plains, Victoria, subalpine, alpine, heath, vegetation</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/2436</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Kanyirninpa : health, masculinity and wellbeing of desert Aboriginal men</field><field name="creator">McCoy, Brian Francis</field><field name="description">Kanyirninpa, or holding, exists as a deeply embedded value amongst desert Aboriginal peoples (Puntu).

These values are transmitted across generations where they provide desert society with identity, cohesion and strength. While kanyirninpa can be identified in the nurturance provided a child after birth, its presence and power is particularly disclosed at ceremonial time.

The older generations of men and women enable this holding to occur. When boys (marnti) become men (wati) the manner of  kanyirninpa changes. No longer do young men seek to be held by their mothers and female relations. Instead, they seek to be held by older men: brothers, uncles and other males.

Undernutrition and poor socio-economic status also contribute to endemic and epidemic infectious disease, including scabies and streptococcal infection. It has been suggested that early undernutrition, and streptococcal and scabies infection are risk factors for renal disease, which is at epidemic levels and increasing. This thesis examines the prevalence of undernutrition in newborns and infants in an Aboriginal community over time, and its impact on childhood growth and child and adult renal markers. The association between skin lesions, streptococcal serology, post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis (PSGN) and renal markers as evaluated through a community wide screening program in 1992-1995 is also examined. Birthweights have increased since the 1960s, but they are still much lower than the non-Aboriginal values. Weights in infancy have decreased since the 1960s. At screening in childhood stunting was common, reflecting the presence of long-term poor nutrition in infancy.

This civic deficit has attracted increased attention by governments, policy makers, and the broad educational community within Australia in recent years. The Report of the Civics Expert Group (1994) identified school education as a major site in which to address this deficit, and the past decade has seen increased emphasis on civics and citizenship education in Australian schools. The thesis critically examines the role of civics and citizenship within Australia secondary schools. It does this, not purely from an educational perspective, but from within the broader context of the contemporary Australian political system. This thesis regards citizenship as inherently a political concept, and develops the notion of democratic citizenship as the most significant element of this. It is argued that democratic citizens are more than merely knowledgeable about their nation&#8217;s democratic traditions, government institutions and constitutional arrangements. While these elements of civics and citizenship education have a role, democratic citizens are genuine members of their political community.

Although frequently used in the literature to describe tasks, &#8216;complexity&#8217; has often lacked definition. Expert opinion about the nature of mathematical complexity was ascertained by seeking the opinions of experts in the areas of mathematics, mathematics education, and gifted education. Expert opinion about task complexity was stimulated by questions about the relative complexity of two tasks. The experts then categorised the complexities within each of these tasks using the Williams/Clarke Framework of Complexity. This framework identifies the dimensions of task complexity and was found by experts to be both useful and adequate for this purpose.

With less than ~25 km of the width of the original continental surface area submerged, the northern Gulf Extensional Province represents a key area to assess the history of strain localisation during the early stages of continental extension. Geological mapping revealed that the basins and ranges of the Sierra San Felipe, located in the hanging wall of the Main Gulf Escarpment, are bounded to the east by an en-echelon array of left-stepping moderate- to low-angle normal faults that represent the next dominant set of normal faults from the break-away fault in direction of transport. Structural displacement estimates suggest up to ~4.5&#8211;9 km of broadly east-directed extension on the Las Cuevitas, Santa Rosa and Huatamote detachments. Fault kinematics suggest a transtensional stress regime with NE- to SE-directed extension and permutating vertical and N&#8211;S subhorizontal shortening. Clockwise vertical-axis block rotations and constrictional folding of the detachments were an integral part of the late Miocene to Pleistocene deformation history of the San Felipe fault array. This overall constrictional strain regime is indistinguishable from the present-day deformation in the Gulf Extensional Province and indicates that the fault array formed during a single phase of integrated transtensional shearing since rifting began in the late Miocene.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">rifting, passive margin, extensional tectonics, structural geology, low-temperature thermochronology, Gulf of California</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/4212</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/4212</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Structure and function of the mammalian small heat shock protein Hsp25</field><field name="creator">Morris, Amie Michelle</field><field name="description">Hsp25 is the murine equivalent of human Hsp27, both of which are members of the small heat shock protein (sHsp) family. sHsps are a group of intracellular molecular chaperones that protect unstable intermediates of cellular proteins from aggregation and precipitation. Hsp27 and other sHsps play a role in various neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's, Alexander's, Creutzfeld-Jakob and Parkinson's diseases. Crystallisation of mammalian sHsps has thus far not been achieved due to the polydisperse and dynamic nature of these proteins. As a result, the oligomeric structure of sHsps is unclear, hindering the elucidation of the functional mechanisms of these proteins. In this study, a series of site-directed Hsp25 mutants was constructed, in which polar residues of the flexible region of the C-terminal extension were replaced with less polar residues. The C-terminal extension of sHsps is typically short and unstructured and is thought to play an important role in solubilising these proteins and the complexes they form with target proteins by counteracting the hydrophobicity of the remainder of the sHsp. The C-terminal extension is also implicated in interaction with target proteins. Wildtype Hsp25 and various C-terminal extension mutants (E190A, R192A, Q194A, E199A, E204A, Q205A, K209L) were expressed and successfully purified. A truncation mutant, E190stop, was also constructed but became insoluble during the purification process, demonstrating the importance of the C-terminal extension in maintaining the stability of Hsp25. Wildtype and mutant Hsp25 proteins were characterised structurally and functionally using a range of spectroscopic techniques, including far-UV circular dichroism spectroscopy, tryptophan and ANS binding fluorescence spectroscopy, sizeexclusion fast protein liquid chromatography, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and chaperone assays under both reduction and heat stress conditions. These experiments enabled the identification of residues key to the chaperone ability of Hsp25. The R192A and Q194A mutants were functionally indistinct from the wildtype protein and exhibited only minor alterations to their structure. It was therefore concluded that the R192 and Q194 residues are not vital for Hsp25 to function as a molecular chaperone. Each of the glutamic acid residue mutants exhibited significant alterations in tertiary structure, with increases in exposure of hydrophobic regions compared with wildtype Hsp25, and a minor decrease in the oligomeric size of the E190A mutant was observed. Functionally, these mutants showed poor thermostability and disrupted chaperone function. Glutamic acid residues are abundantly present in proteins from thermophilic organisms and are implicated in the stability of these proteins at high temperatures. Replacement of each of the glutamic acid residues in the C-terminal extension of Hsp25 resulted in loss of solubility at elevated temperatures, indicating that these residues perform similar roles in both Hsp25 and thermophilic proteins. The increase in surface hydrophobicity may have contributed to the poor thermostability of these mutants and also the inefficient capture of target proteins observed in the chaperone assays. The tertiary and quaternary structures of the Q205A mutant were significantly perturbed and the function of this mutant was completely abolished under heat stress conditions. Alterations to the tertiary structure of the N-terminal domain were observed and oligomerisation was severely disrupted, with three distinct oligomeric forms being present: an oligomer larger than that of the wildtype protein and two smaller oligomers. The chaperone activity of this mutant was comparable to that of wildtype Hsp25 under reduction stress conditions, indicating that each of the oligomeric forms were functional. Under heat stress conditions, however, the Q205A mutant co-precipitated along with the target proteins. Flexibility of the mutated residue was considerably decreased, as assessed by NMR experiments, but the remainder of the C-terminal extension was not significantly altered. Together, these results lead to the conclusion that the Q205 residue is vital for the performance of Hsp25 as a molecular chaperone at elevated temperatures. Mutation of the K209 residue also showed disruption to the oligomerisation of Hsp25, with the K209L mutant eluting as three peaks after size-exclusion chromatography. This mutant was functionally defective under reduction stress conditions but showed comparable chaperone activity to the wildtype at high temperature, suggesting that the smaller oligomeric species require temperature-induced structural alterations in order to acquire chaperone ability. Because full chaperone activity was observed under reduction stress conditions, direct interactions between the C- terminal lysine residue of Hsp25 and target proteins is unlikely to be a requirement of chaperone activity. The stabilisation of &#945;B-crystallin by &#945;A-crystallin is important for the maintenance of the structure and function of &#945;B-crystallin in the eye lens, where these sHsps are present in a ~3:1 ratio. Outside the eye lens, however, &#945;A-crystallin is found only in trace amounts in some tissues. Co-complexes between various sHsps have been observed in vivo, for example between &#945;B-crystallin and Hsp27, and it has been proposed that one or more ubiquitous sHsps stabilise &#945;B-crystallin in non-lenticular tissues. Whilst &#945;B-crystallin was found to be unstable above ~69&#186;C, Hsp25 remained almost completely in solution at 100&#186;C. A 3:1 Hsp25:&#945;B-crystallin mixture showed practically identical thermostability to the Hsp25 homo-oligomer and provides support for the role of this sHsp as a stabiliser of &#945;B-crystallin. Chaperone activity assays of the 3:1 mixture show results closely resembling those of the Hsp25 homooligomer and demonstrate that interactions between the two sHsps result in an altered chaperone activity of &#945;B-crystallin. Significant insights into the structure and function of Hsp25 were gained in this study. Several residues in the C-terminal extension were identified as critical to the structural and functional integrity of this sHsp and analysis of the amino acid composition of the C-terminal extensions of sHsps from various organisms indicate that some of these residues may play similar roles in other sHsps.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/744</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Filamentary H&#945; structure in the milky way</field><field name="creator">Walker, Andrew J</field><field name="description">The first part of this thesis presents the first results of a search for new optical supernova remnant candidates and other filamentary objects on films produced by the Anglo-Australian Observatory/UK Schmidt Telescope H&#945; Survey. Sixty-one fields, or 26 percent of the Galactic plane survey fields, have been visually examined. This resulted in the detection of four new large diameter filamentary structures, and the discovery of extensive new optical emission in two previously known optical supernova remnant candidates. The second part of this thesis presents results of a study we made using the FLAIR instrument on the UK Schmidt Telescope to obtain optical spectra of several filaments in RCW 114, a filamentary nebulae of about 250 arcmin diameter. These confirm that the emission is being produced by the interaction of the shock wave of a supernova remnant with the surrounding interstellar medium. We also obtained narrow-band H&#945;+[Nii] and [S ii] images to examine the spatial variation in ionisation structure. The third part of this thesis gives the result of a search using films from the UKST H&#945; Survey where the locations of 86 Galactic supernova remnants were examined for optical emission. From these we had likely detections of 8 objects and possible detections of 4 others.

In Chapter 1, I present some brief discussions about superconductivity and its relevant theories and history. Extensive examples are given for superconductor applications. At Chapter 2, a literature Review of MgB&#8322;superconductor is given. In this chapter, MgB&#8322;&#8217;s discovery, particulars and current research are discussed. In Chapter 3, the experimental details and relevant laboratory measurement equipments are introduced; specifically X-ray Diffraction and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) measurements are discussed. From Chapter 4 through Chapter 7, various methods of MgB&#8322; thick film/short tape fabrication were discussed, as well as the corresponding results. At Chapter 4, we studied the Cu and Nano-SiC doped MgB&#8322; thick films on Ni substrates processed using a very short-time, in-situ reaction. Pure and doped MgB&#8322; thick films were fabricated on Ni substrates with varying amounts of elemental Cu and Nano-SiC powders, samples were sintering at 840&#176;C or 900&#176;C for just a few minutes, and then quenched in liquid nitrogen. We found that for films sintered at 900&#176;C, critical current densities Jc were achieved as high as 1.4 &#215; 106 A/cm&#178; at 20 K and 2 T for the pure and SiC added films. Films doped with 5 wt% of Cu powders were observed to have better adherence to the Ni substrate without degradation in Tc, and Jc was found to be slightly decreased, but still remains as high as 7 &#215; 105 A/cm&#178; at 20 K in zero field. It was observed that Jc and irreversibility field increase with an increasing sintering temperature up to 900&#176;C. Furthermore, Nano-SiC addition has significantly improved the irreversibility field compared to un-doped MgB&#8322; films. In Chapter 5, the effect of nano-Y-ZrO&#8322; (YSZ) addition on the microstructure and critical current density of MgB&#8322; superconductors was studied. XRD results showed that YSZ does not react with MgB&#8322;. Furthermore, the transition temperatures of the YSZ Nano-particle doped samples dropped about 3 K compared to the un-doped samples. Samples doped with YSZ powders showed a higher critical current density in low magnetic fields, however the Jc drops faster compared to that made by long time sintering samples. It is proposed that the improved Jc in low fields was due to the enhanced density of the sample, which was caused by the YSZ Nano-particle inclusion. In Chapter 6, I discuss the fabrication, microstructure and critical current density of pure and Cu doped MgB&#8322; thick films on Cu, Ni and stainless steel substrates by short-time, in-situ reaction. These thick films were prepared using a short time sintering method. Results showed that single MgB&#8322; phase films can be easily formed in a short period of time (3 minutes) at temperatures above 700&#176;C. Un-doped MgB&#8322; films were found to be loosely attached to the Ni and stainless steel substrates. However, the MgB&#8322; with Cu powders addition adhered well to the substrates without serious degradation of Tc and flux pinning. The Jc increased by one order of magnitude and irreversibility field determined from M-H loops also increased when sintering temperature increased from 745&#176;C to 900&#176;C. Jc values in the range of 1-9 x 105 A/cm2 at 15 K have been achieved for both doped and un-doped films sintered at 900&#176;C for a short 3 minutes of time. Finally at Chapter 7, I look at the significant improvement of critical current density in Cu sheathed MgB&#8322; tapes through Nano-SiC doping and short-time in-situ reaction. We found that Nano-SiC doping samples resulted in a very high critical current density of more than 1 MA per square centimetre in zero field at T &#8804; 10 K. It is also found that these Nano-SiC doped MgB&#8322; /Cu tapes exhibited very small flux jumping at 5 K, indicating a high thermal stability. Such a high Jc field performance together with high thermal stability and large mechanical flexibility makes the Cu-sheathed MgB&#8322; tapes an attractive candidate for large scale applications.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/404</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Crystal growth, magnetism, transport and superconductivity of two dimensional sodium cobalt oxide single crystals</field><field name="creator">Chen, Dapeng</field><field name="description">The objective of this work was to study the single crystal growth of NaxCoO2 by the optical floating zone technique and the intrinsic properties of the high quality single crystal samples thus produced. The properties of the superconductors derived from it will also be reported. This thesis, after a literature review on the NaxCoO2 family and the superconductors derived from it, reports a systematic study on growing NaxCoO2 (x = 0.32&#8211;1.00) and NaxCoO2 &#8226; yH2O (x = 0.22&#8211;0.47, y = 1.3). The experiments demonstrate that nearly pure &#945;- (x = 0.90&#8211;1.00) and &#940;- (x = 0.75) phases of NaxCoO2 crystals could be obtained using the optical floating zone method, while other phases with lower sodium content, x &lt; 0.70 (&#946;-phase with x = 0.55, 0.60 and &#947;-phase with x = 0.65 and 0.70, respectively), are observed always to contain Na2O, Co3O4, and Na-poor phases. There is experimental evidence that the dependence of the superconducting transition temperature on Na content is much weaker than reported earlier. Implications of the Na effect for understanding of the structure, thermoelectricity, and superconducting phase diagram are discussed. Na-extraction and hydration were carried out on the &#945;- and &#940;-samples to obtain the superconducting phase. Hydrated single crystals exhibit cracked layers perpendicular to the c-axis, due to a large expansion when the water is inserted into the structure. A study of intercalation/de-intercalation was performed to determine the stability of the hydrated phase and the effects of hydration on the structure of the compound. X-ray diffraction and thermogravimetric experiments were used to monitor the processes of accommodation of water molecules and their removal from the crystal lattice. The initial intercalation process takes place with two water molecules (corresponding to y = 0.6) inserted in a formula unit, followed by a group of four (y = 1.3) to form a Na(H2O)4 cluster. Thermogravimetric analysis suggests that de-intercalation occurs with the removal of the water molecules one by one from the hydrated cluster at elevated temperatures of approximately 50, 100, 200, and 300oC. Our investigations reveal that the hydration process is dynamic and that water molecule intercalation and de-intercalation follow different reaction paths in an irreversible way. This thesis also contains intensive studies on the cobalt oxide superconductors NaxCoO2 &#8226; 1.3H2O based on 59Co nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and nuclear quadrupole resonance (NQR) measurements. For the sample with x = 0.26 and critical temperature Tc = 4.6 K, it was found that the spin&#8211;lattice relaxation rate, 1/T1, shows a T3 variation below Tc and down to very low temperatures, which indicates the presence of line nodes in the superconducting (SC) gap function. The spin susceptibility below Tc for these samples was also studied via Knight shift measurements. The spin part of the Knight shift decreases below Tc in both the a- and c- directions, indicating a singlet spin state of the Cooper pairs. Our results strongly suggest that the superconducting state is a d-wave state. Based on bulk measurements of the electron momentum distribution, using the technique of x-ray Compton scattering, we present evidence that small, elliptically shaped pockets do indeed exist in the Fermi surface of cobalt oxide superconductors. The magnetic properties of two-layer NaxCoO2 (x = 0.42, 0.82, and 0.87) were studied. The magnetic susceptibility measurements revealed considerable anisotropy along H//ab and H//c for the as-grown single crystals. It was found that an antiferromagnetic transition with N&#233;el temperature, TN = 21 K, occurred for the x = 0.82 sample, and there was a paramagnetic phase for the x = 0.87 sample over a wide temperature range from 2 to 300 K, while the sample with x = 0.42 showed a monotonic increase of &#967; with increasing temperature above ~100 K. In addition, the x = 0.82 sample had the largest derived anisotropic g-factor ratio (gab/gc &amp;asymp; 1.30), whereas the sample with x = 0.42 was nearly isotropic (gab/gc &amp;asymp; 0.96). Magnetic susceptibility measurements on three-layer alpha-NaxCoO2 (x = 0.91, 0.92, and 0.93) showed that the magnetic properties depend strongly on x. The compound was found to be antiferromagnetic at TN &amp;asymp; 20 K for x = 0.91 and x = 0.92, and paramagnetic for x = 0.93. In-plane and out-of-plane anisotropy were observed for the x = 0.91 crystals. In addition, the anisotropic g-factor ratio (gab/gc) derived from the anisotropic susceptibility along H//ab and H//c decreased significantly as the sodium composition increased from x = 0.91 to x = 0.93. A systematic study was also carried out on the conduction mechanism and the anisotropy of the electrical transport properties of the &#945;-Na0.91CoO2 single crystals. The resistivity was found to show a large anisotropy along the ab plane and the c axis. The resistivity below the metal-to-insulator transition temperature (20 K) can be well fitted by the variable-range hopping model. The high temperature range can be fitted well by &#961;(T) = &#961;0 + A&#969;s/sinh2(&#1115;&#969;s/2kBT) + BT7/2, both for the in-plane and the out-of-plane behaviours. Such behaviour provides evidence for small polaron and spin-wave scattering metallic conduction in heavily Na-doped sodium cobaltate.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/405</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Palaeoenvironments of the Gulf of Carpentaria from the last glacial maximum to the present, as determined by foraminiferal assemblages</field><field name="creator">Holt, Sabine</field><field name="description">This thesis presents a palaeoenvironmental study of the Gulf of Carpentaria, northern Australia, from around the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) to the present. Foraminifers, microscopic unicellular aquatic organisms, occur throughout the sediment in the time frame studied. Data on the species composition and preservation of the microfossils found in the Gulf of Carpentaria cores are utilised to reconstruct past environments by comparison to the known assemblages of living foraminifers in various modern environments. The Gulf of Carpentaria is a shallow epicontinental sea, situated between Australia and Papua New Guinea, and is a maximum of 70m deep. It is separated from the Pacific Ocean to the east by Torres Strait, which is 12m deep at its shallowest, and from the Indian Ocean and Arafura Sea to the west by the Arafura Sill, which is 53m below sea-level (bpsl) at its shallowest. For at least ten thousand years in the lead up to the LGM (which reached its peak about twenty thousand years ago), and for about ten thousand years after, sea levels were lower than the 53m-deep Arafura Sill. The continental shelf in the Gulf of Carpentaria area between Australia and Papua New Guinea was exposed, creating a land bridge between the two islands, and a lake developed in the Carpentaria Basin. This palaeolake is termed Lake Carpentaria (named by Torgersen et al., 1983). Documentation of the timing in fluctuations in the extent and salinity of Lake Carpentaria provides information on local and regional climatic systems, such as the Australian summer monsoon. Constraining the nature and timing of the postglacial rise in sea-level which flooded the lake provides evidence for global eustatic sea-level reconstructions. Analysis of sediment cores from the Gulf of Carpentaria, beginning around 40ka cal BP (forty thousand calendar years before present), shows the existence of Lake Carpentaria (a large, non-marine water body of fluctuating extent) until sealevel rose over the Arafura Sill and inundated the palaeolake around 10.5ka cal BP. The earliest studied phase dates to around 40ka cal BP which is a marineinfluenced brackish water lacustrine facies where Lake Carpentaria is briefly at its maximum extent: 12m deep in its deepest section. The existence of such a large body of water (around 150,000km2) supports the existence of a strong Walker Circulation in the region enhancing precipitation. Between 40ka and 18.8ka cal BP the non-marine, increasingly saline, Lake Carpentaria decreased to 7m maximum water depth, adding to the evidence of aridity around the LGM in northern Australia. At 18.8ka cal BP the lake freshened and monospecific bivalve, foraminiferal and ostracod populations dominated the still shallow (around 8m deep) lake. The lake was expanding, and from around 15&#177;2ka cal BP, fluctuations are noted in the general trend of increasing precipitation. The recorded variations in precipitation intensity may result from stronger seasonality (i.e. monsoons) and/or interdecadal variability (e.g. El Ni&#241;o Southern Oscillation). At 12.7ka cal BP Lake Carpentaria was at around 12m maximum water depth &#8211; the maximum documented extent in the studied period. At this stage there was some exchange of waters with the Arafura Sea via tidal outlet channels in the Arafura Sill (indicating sea-level around 60m below present), seen as a marine influence beginning in the western margins at 12.7ka cal BP. At 12.4ka cal BP the sealevel had risen to the same height as water levels within the lake (58m bpsl). By 12.2.ka cal BP sea-level was up to 2m higher than the previous lake level, and flowed into the lagoonal Lake Carpentaria via channels in the Arafura Sill. By 10.5ka cal BP the sea-level had overtopped the highest surface of the 53m-deep Arafura Sill and the transition to marine conditions began in the Gulf of Carpentaria, confirming the accepted models of sea-level rise.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/409</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Habitat associations of the long-nosed potoroo (potoroos tridactylus) at multiple spatial scales</field><field name="creator">Norton, Melinda A</field><field name="description">The long-nosed potoroo (Potorous tridactylus) is a threatened, ground-dwelling marsupial known to have been highly disadvantaged by changes brought about since European settlement in Australia.  Key threats to the species are believed to be fox predation and habitat loss and/or fragmentation. In order to conserve the species, the important habitat elements for the species at both the coarse and fine scale need to be identified and managed appropriately.  The aims of this study were to examine the coarse- and fine-scale habitat preferences of the long-nosed potoroo, using a variety of techniques, in two National Park reserves (Barren Grounds Nature Reserve and Budderoo National Park) in the Southern Highlands of New South Wales in order to inform management. The ecology of the long-nosed potoroo in this region is poorly understood, making this study both timely and critical.    Assessments of the morphometrics of the local long-nosed potoroo populations and their relative abundance, in addition to fox predation pressure at these localities, were also undertaken to assist in the conservation of the local potoroo population.Live-trapping was conducted in autumn and spring, from 2004 to 2008, at 103 trap sites across the two study areas and morphometric data were collected. The local long-nosed potoroos were found to be larger in size than Victorian animals but smaller than north-eastern NSW animals supporting the concept of a cline in body size for the species with weight increasing with latitude on the mainland.  Sexual dimorphism was also observed with adult males having larger body weights, head lengths and pes lengths.  Between one to two thirds of all males and females at either study area were only captured in a single trapping session, indicative of high levels of transience and/or low levels of survivorship.  Of the two study areas, Barren Grounds Nature Reserve supported a larger number of individuals and appeared to have a greater degree of home range overlap between individuals, which was considered indicative of a higher quality habitat at this study area. Overall, the two study area populations appear to have increased over the course of the study.  The sand plot technique, used in both study areas each Autumn and Spring from 2005 to 2008 as a second technique to monitor potoroo relative abundance, was considered less effective than trapping.  This was due to its inability to decipher between individuals with overlapping home ranges in higher density populations and the species&#8217; reduced utilisation of tracks compared to many other species. A number of habitat attributes were examined at each trap site to allow comparison with trap success ratings as an indication of macrohabitat preferences.  In Spring 2007 and Autumn 2008, microhabitat use was also examined at both study areas, using the spool-and-line technique and an assessment of forage diggings.  The results indicated that while potoroos were trapped at sites with a wide range of macrohabitat attributes, the species displayed a number of macrohabitat preferences, particularly for greater levels of canopy and shrub cover, for ferns as a dominant ground cover type and for lower levels of floristic diversity in ground cover. Differences in the macrohabitats present at each study area, as well as those preferred at either study area, were also observed.  Microhabitat attributes were assessed along the spool paths as well as in the available habitat to allow comparison of observed and expected usage.  The spooling results revealed that while most individual potoroos had significant preferences for some microhabitat attributes, no clear trends were evident across all individuals spooled.  Comparison of the presence/absence of forage diggings and associated microhabitat attributes at systematic sample points within the available habitat was also undertaken. Potoroos also displayed preferences for foraging in locations with higher shrub cover densities and more open ground cover.  Between the two scales of investigation, patterns of habitat preferences differed. The species&#8217; habitat use appears to be influenced by both macro- and micro-scale preferences, highlighting the importance of examining habitat associations at multiple scales.The relative abundance of foxes fluctuated over the study as indicated by sand plots monitored in both Autumn and Spring from 2005 to 2008 in both study areas. Yet despite the often high fox predation risks, individual potoroos were not all preferentially utilising higher levels of ground cover or habitat complexity.  Despite dense vegetative cover being a common attribute in potoroo habitat, my results support the theory that the species requires habitat patchiness, with structural and floristic preferences varying during different activities.  This includes the use of relatively open, floristically-diverse patches for foraging activity, providing some level of cover from aerial but not ground predation during foraging. Analysis of fox scats at the same study sites indicated a high prevalence of potoroo remains. Consequently, it was not considered likely that the species is afforded adequate protection against fox predation by its use of habitat.  Future management should aim to perpetuate the diversity of vegetation attributes at each of the study areas while avoiding practices that simplify such habitat. The effective control of foxes in and around potoroo habitat was also considered likely to assist in the conservation of the species.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/832</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Arab community and religious leaders' views about utilisation of mental health services amongst Arabic-speaking people in Australia</field><field name="creator">Youssef, Jacqueline</field><field name="description">Traditionally, utilisation of mental health services by Arabic-speaking communities in Australia has been low. Interviews were conducted with 35 key informants from Arabic-speaking backgrounds, exploring their perceptions of mental illness in the Arab community, together with their views about preferred forms of support and treatment. Transcript analysis of audio-taped interviews identified barriers to professional mental health help-seeking and utilisation of mental health services in the Arabic community. Shame and stigma appeared to be the overwhelming hindrance to accessing services, due to strong cultural prohibitions on exposing any personal or family matters to outsiders. The findings emphasised the perceived negative effect of mental illness on important cultural institutions, such as marriage. The results revealed strong concerns about confidentiality and lack of trust in service providers. Religious leaders were identified as important sources of help for mental health problems.The role of Arab clergy within their community is well known and respected. The second study explored the beliefs, attitudes and roles that Arab religious leaders have in relation to people with mental illness in their communities. Eighty-five Muslim and 85 Christian Arab religious leaders were surveyed using a structured questionnaire which solicited their perceptions of the causes of mental illness, attitudes toward people with mental illness and opinions regarding treatment and medication. Furthermore, the questionnaire focussed on types of support provided by clergy for those with mental illness and their families and the scope of their awareness of Community Mental Health Services. Findings indicated that Arab clergy believed drug and alcohol addiction, stressful life events, childhood trauma and spiritual poverty were the most important causes of mental illness. Over 50% of Arab clergy believed that psychiatric medications were addictive and harmful to the body in the long term, although about 65% thought that medication was helpful as a treatment.  Generally, Arab clergy&#8217;s attitudes toward the mentally ill were positive and most had normalising attitudes with 73% agreeing that &#8220;people with mental illness have an illness like any other&#8221;. Most respondents agreed that people with mental illness could be helped and suggested they were relatively comfortable with and willing to provide support to people with mental illness. However, most also indicated a lack of sufficient knowledge to be of effective help and they were not confident making referrals to mental health services.Arab clergy were unfamiliar with their local Community Mental Health Services but were unanimously predisposed to referring to such sources of help.  The key factors to establishing Arab clergy&#8217;s collaboration with professional mental health services were shown to be the mental health provider&#8217;s reputation, religious beliefs, values and level of awareness of Arab culture.  Collaboration with Arab clergy and professional mental health providers may promote and influence better access to existing mental health services and improve the help seeking process to increase future service utilisation. There is an immediate need for government and non-government organisations with interests in mental health to initiate collaborative work with Arab clergy in order to address access, utilisation and referral issues. There is also a need for educational opportunities and two-way communication with existing mental health services to improve the capacity of Arabic-speaking clergy to better support people with mental illness.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/831</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Assessing the effectiveness of corporate web sites: an experimental study of the web acceptance model</field><field name="creator">Suh, Koo-Won</field><field name="description">There has been an ongoing need for designing and assessing corporate Web sites as important marketing communication tools. Typically, most research on Web site effectiveness has adopted traditional advertising evaluation models. A fundamental shortcoming of this approach is that it does not provide much information about user interaction. As corporate Web sites are new interactive media and Web user characteristics are far different from those of traditional communication media, new approaches should be developed. To overcome the inherent shortcomings of previous research, this study has developed a new theoretical framework, the Web Acceptance Model (WAM), which explores customer acceptance and uses of corporate Web sites. This study took an interdisciplinary approach involving theory derived from Marketing, Communication, Information Systems (IS), Education, and Psychology. The model is premised on two central phenomena of Web-Mediated Communication (WMC): social interaction between Web sites and users, and the active participation of users. In the model, the phenomenon of social interaction is captured by the inclusion of moderating variables: affective and task-related interaction which can help explain &#8220;why&#8221; a specific type of Web site is likely to be more effective. It is unlikely that a particular type of Web site will be effective all of the time. Therefore, this model also seeks to explain &#8220;when&#8221; a Web site is more likely to effective. Individual user difference as a moderator can help explain &#8220;when&#8221; and reflects the active role of customers in WMC. Finally, the model addresses all three elements of consumer attitudes i.e., affective, cognitive, and conative. Specifically, the model includes predictor, moderator, mediator, and criterion variables. The predictor (independent) variables are Web site content and structure. Content analysis was used to identify Web site typology in terms of structure and content. It was necessary to conduct an empirical study of Web site typology, as there was no published research on this topic. Empirically derived typology may better explain real world phenomena than a conceptually developed typology. Through content analysis of around 386 corporate Web sites, this study identified two types of Web site structure (&#8220;hypermedia&#8221; and &#8220;static image&#8221;) and two types of content (&#8220;integrated communication&#8221; and &#8220;basic image&#8221;). The criterion variables, which are the communication effects achieved by a Web site, are measured in terms of overall attitude toward the Web site and revisit intention. Among three mediators between the predictor and criterion variables, &#8220;social presence&#8221; serves as an affective bridge, while &#8220;perceived usefulness&#8221; and &#8220;perceived ease of use&#8221; serve as cognitive bridges. Finally, Web literacy serves as a moderator, which affects the direction and strength of the relationships between the predictors and mediators. The overall purpose of this study was to uncover the distinguishing features of effective corporate Web sites (i.e., those sites which are seen by users to be attractive, userfriendly and useful). To do this, the study sought to answer two exploratory questions and test hypotheses derived from the model. The exploratory questions were: (1) What content and structural elements are presented on corporate Web sites? and (2) How can corporate Web sites be classified according to their content and structure? These questions were answered through a preliminary content analysis of corporate Web sites. Fourteen hypotheses were derived to answer the three experimental research questions: (1) How do consumers respond to different types of Web site? (2) Do user attitudes toward corporate Web sites vary according to Web literacy levels? and (3) What features of corporate Web sites determine revisit intention amongst Web users? The first five hypotheses addressed how customers respond to different types of Web sites. The next five hypotheses examined what features of corporate Web sites determine revisit intention amongst Web users. The final four hypotheses investigated whether user attitudes toward corporate Web sites vary according to their Web literacy levels. These hypotheses were tested through a laboratory experiment. This study employed a 2 (Web site structure) &#215; 2 (Web site content) between-subject factorial design, with Web literacy serving as a co-variant. Each subject was allowed to explore only one of four specially constructed Web sites. Subjects were randomly assigned to each cell. The data was gathered through a self-report instrument, of which validity and reliability were ensured by a rigorous two-stage pilot test. Empirical evidence was gathered from one hundred and sixty students at the University of Wollongong in Australia who were recruited for the experiment. The data was analysed using the statistical methods of MANCOVA, ANCOVA, ANOVA, Multiple Linear Regression, and Simple Linear Regression. In terms of Web site content, it was found that the integrated communication type of Web site was more effective than the basic information type. The integrated type had higher social presence and perceived usefulness. In relation to Web site structure, it was found that the hypermedia type was more effective than the static image type, generating higher social presence and perceived usefulness. The results of this investigation suggest that social presence and perceived usefulness were critical factors that explain &#8220;why&#8221; a specific type of Web site is more effective than the other type. The more positive social presence and perceived usefulness were, the higher attitude toward the Web site was, and in turn, the higher revisit intention was. However, there was no significant relationship between perceived ease of use and attitude toward the Web site. It was also concluded that Web literacy moderate the relationship between Web structure and social presence. For example, people who with low Web literacy experienced higher differences in social presence between static image type and hypermedia type than those with high Web literacy. These results imply that both Web site structure and content had effects on consumer attitude and the two dimensions of social interaction (i.e., social presence and perceived usefulness) are critical factors for identifying consumer responses to Web sites. One of the interesting findings was the importance of an emotional response, meaning that it is not possible to fully explain consumer behaviour without the understanding of emotional responses to Web sites. The Web Acceptance Model provides a new way of conceptualising social interaction, which is central to WMC, and underlines the importance of an interdisciplinary research to our understanding of WMC. Therefore, it is hoped that this study will make a significant contribution to a burgeoning area of research that is of great and increasing importance to both the discipline and the practice of marketing.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/354</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Lines Of Flight: The Design History of the Qantas Flight Attendants' Uniform</field><field name="creator">Black, Prudence</field><field name="description">Doctor of Philosophy(PhD)</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Qantas</field><field name="subject">Uniforms</field><field name="subject">Design history</field><field name="subject">Flight Attendant</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/5397</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Successful prisoner reentry : an analysis of the most important variables</field><field name="creator">Wilson, Anna</field><field name="description">Prisoner reentry is becomingly increasingly recognised as a significant societal problem. Almost all prisoners will be released will reenter the community and many will reoffend. Internationally, imprisonment rates continue to rise, compounding the challenge to the criminal justice system that the current system of incarceration and reentry creates. Gaps remain in our understanding of the reentry process and the challenges faced by released prisoners. Previous reentry research has tended to focus on specific issues such as accommodation or employment or have used prisoner interviews as the data source. The gaps in reentry literature are compounded by conflicting definitions of 'successful' reentry. Research was undertaken to examine the definition of 'successful reentry' and to determine the most important variables deemed to affect successful prisoner reentry. Semi structured interviews were conducted with twenty-four stakeholders with a variety of roles in prisoner reentry in Western Australia. Additional data was collected from published government reports, policy documents, research reports and academic literature. The interview findings determined that accommodation, employment, social networks and education and treatment programs were deemed to have the most significant impact on prisoner reentry. One of the most significant findings to emerge is the significance of social networks. This study has found evidence that the value of social networks has been neglected in reentry policy. One of the core issues examined throughout this process was the definition of 'successful reentry'.  The term 'successful reentry' requires clarification, alongside elucidation of related goals and measurements. Measures of reentry 'success' need to be developed further or ameliorated by additional criterion as successful reentry is a more complex problem than existing recidivism measures can address. This thesis challenges the existing understanding of the needs of prisoners reentering the community and suggests strategies for improving the reentry process and related outcomes. Future reentry policy needs to give greater weight to the value of social networks and establish mechanisms to facilitate the development and maintenance of these networks, which will in turn, assist prisoners to secure accommodation and employment opportunities.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Ex-convicts</field><field name="subject">Criminals -- Rehabilitation</field><field name="subject">Recidivism -- Prevention</field><field name="subject">Ex-convicts -- Education</field><field name="subject">Ex-convictss -- Housing</field><field name="subject">Ex-convicts -- Social networks</field><field name="subject">Ex-convicts -- Employment</field><field name="subject">Reentry</field><field name="subject">Throughcare</field><field name="subject">Transition to community</field><field name="subject">Rehabilitation</field><field name="subject">Social networks</field><field name="subject">Community</field><field name="subject">Prison</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0258</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Thermal Effects and Temperature Profiles in Capillary Electrophoresis</field><field name="creator">Evenhuis, CJ</field><field name="description">Whilst temperature control is usually employed in capillary electrophoresis (CE) to aid heat dissipation and provide acceptable precision, internal electrolyte temperatures are almost never measured. In principle this limits the accuracy, repeatability and method robustness. This work presents a fundamental study that combines the development of new equations characterising temperature profiles in CE with a new method of temperature determination. New equations were derived from first principles relating the mean, axial and inner wall electrolyte temperatures (TMean, TAxis and TWall). TMean was shown to occur at a distance 1/&#8730;2 times the internal radius of the capillary from the centre of the capillary and to be the average of TAxis and TWall. Conductance (G) and electroosmotic mobility (&#956;EOF) were used to determine TMean and TWall, respectively. Extrapolation of curves of &#956;EOF versus power per unit length (P/L) at different temperatures was used to calibrate the variation of &#956;EOF with temperature (T), free from Joule heating effects. &#956;EOF increased at 2.22 % per &#186;C. The experimentally-determined temperatures using &#956;EOF agreed to within 0.2 oC with those determined using G. The accuracy of G measurements was confirmed independently by measuring the electrical conductivity (&#954;) of the bulk electrolyte over a range of temperatures and by calculating the variation of G with T from the Debye-H&#252;ckel-Onsager equation. TMean was found to be up to 20 oC higher than the external temperature under typical conditions using active air-cooling and a 74.0 &#956;m internal diameter (di) fused-silica capillary. A combination of experimentally-determined and calculated temperatures enabled a complete temperature profile for a fused-silica capillary to be drawn, the thickness of the stationary air layer to be determined and the heat transfer coefficient (h) for the capillary to be determined.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/7733</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/7733/2/01_Front_CJE.doc</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/7733/1/02_whole_CJE.pdf</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Medicine in Advanced Modernity: Marketization, Expertise and the Problem of Trust</field><field name="creator">Cook, CJ</field><field name="description">This thesis is an analysis of doctors' understandings of, and responses to, changes to medicine and the doctor-patient relationship that locates them within a broader framework of socio-historical transformation. In the context of advanced modernity, adaptation to change is a key challenge facing orthodox medicine. Data on changes in the nature and context of medicine are drawn from a sample of editorials of the Australian Medical Journal, the Lancet, the Journal of the American Medical Association and the New England Journal of Medicine over the period 1965-1995. Data on the perceptions and experiences of individual doctors are drawn from semi-structured, in-depth interviews of general practitioners and specialist practitioners working in metropolitan, rural and remote regions of Tasmania and South Australia. Data from both sources are analyzed with the assistance of the qualitative analysis software package ATLAS/ti. The thesis demonstrates linkages between commodification, differentiation and rationalisation and the emergence of social processes and phenomena relevant to changing doctor-patient relationships, including the marketization of medicine and the rise of consumerism, the proliferation of knowledge and the specialisation of expertise. In contemporary social contexts (and most noticeably in metropolitan practice settings), doctor-patient relationships increasingly take the form of short-lived, 'restricted exchanges' in a market setting. Trust is becoming more problematic just as it simultaneously becomes more necessary as a mechanism for dealing with complexity and uncertainty.  Five factors contribute to the 'problematization' of trust in medicine as an expert system: 1) increasing public knowledge of and access to healing systems and philosophies other than Western biomedicine, known collectively as complementary or alternative therapies; 2) growing emphasis on medicine as a 'business' and patients as 'consumers' of medical care; 3) the large and growing number of specialties and the dominance of 'high-tech' medical care; 4) greater 'visibility' of medical and scientific knowledge and particularly of the 'disputes that divide experts'; and 5) the increasingly litigious nature of wider society resulting in the new centrality of contracts, informed consent, the disclosure of diagnoses and risks and the practice of 'defensive medicine'. These factors all have implications for trust at the interpersonal level. The project indicates that, by virtue of its growing relevance to points 1) and 4), in particular, the Internet has the potential to impact upon, or even transform lay-expert relationships in a way that has only been partially realized to date. The project also finds evidence of role confusion among doctors associated with rapid social change and the diminishing public acceptance of 'paternalistic' doctor-patient relationships. It reveals considerable tension between high levels of marketization and the service-orientation and altruism central to traditional notions of professionalism. Doctors (particularly general practitioners) find themselves at the centre of a complex web of contradictory pressures and their individual and collective efforts to build and maintain trust can inadvertently contribute to its further erosion.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">320100 Medicine - General</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/27</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/27/1/02whole.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/27/3/01front.pdf</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Maternal and nutritional factors affecting larval competency in the spiny lobster, Jasus edwardsii.</field><field name="creator">Smith, GG</field><field name="description">The major impediment to closing the life-cycle of Jasus edwardsii Hutton (Decapoda: Palinuridae), a spiny lobster being assessed as a candidate for aquaculture, lies with larval rearing. Larval development in J. edwardsii phyllosoma is a complex and protracted phase taking in excess of 300 days in captivity. Often the initial phyllosoma competency (survival and growth) is poor and thought to be associated with parental influences. To improve survival in culture a method to assess larval competency at hatch was determined and environmental, physiological and nutritional influences on competency assessed. 
 
 The development of an activity test to assess larval competence involved short-term exposure of phyllosoma larvae to temperature and salinity stresses, responses monitored (stress indices) and later correlated with survival in starvation tests and in culture. The initial activity test (1 h in 23&#195;&#130;&#194;&#186;C at 10 o/oo) was refined (1 h in 21&#195;&#130;&#194;&#186;C at 10 o/oo) during an examination of nutritional influence on larval competency allowing the most competent larvae to be selected for culture, a significant advantage for any potential aquaculture species. 
 
 The effect of exposing broodstock to elevated temperatures (17 and 19&#195;&#130;&#194;&#186;C) during embryonic development was assessed in relation to the larval competence of newly-hatched phyllosoma. Elevated temperature provided out-of-season larvae by accelerating embryonic development by up to 2 months however; the larvae produced were smaller and less competent than those incubated under ambient conditions (9.5-13&#195;&#130;&#194;&#186;C). This was a significant finding as it ended the use of this technique to provide out-of-season phyllosoma larvae and stimulated research into alternate methods to provide phyllosoma at different times during the year. 
 
 Larval competence was also assessed in relation to broodstock physiology. Larger females produced larger phyllosoma, which demonstrated a greater potential for survival in culture, ascertained by stress indices and LD-50. Viable fecundity (phyllosoma number at hatch) in captivity was 45% of that expected from fisheries estimates and may indicate a reduction in fecundity associated with captivity, an area identified as requiring further dedicated studies. Size at onset of maturity was correlated with morphometric changes to male leg length and female abdominal segment width, providing non-destructive correlates for determining maturity in both males and non-ovigerous females. 
 
 The ability of juvenile Artemia, the predominant food source of cultured J. edwardsii phyllosoma larvae, to assimilate a range of enrichment products was assessed. The nutritional factors targeted were those credited with improving larval competency in crustaceans and included lipids and the development of a protocol for enrichment with ascorbic acid (AA). These live feed studies demonstrated that both lipid and AA (particulate form) are assimilated by juvenile Artemia (at &gt;1% of Artemia dw for AA) concomitant with enrichment concentrations, and maintained with short-term starvation. The lipid assimilation ability of juvenile Artemia was examined in relation to the loss of gut content, a common occurrence during the external mastication process of J. edwardsii larval feeding. Gut content did not make a significant contribution to total Artemia profiles shortly after the cessation of enrichment meaning any subsequent loss that may occur during feeding would not significantly alter Artemia nutritional profiles. It is considered that juvenile Artemia, like smaller metanauplii are powerful a tool for the delivery of specialized enrichment products. 
 
 Dietary influences on the maternal lipid and fatty acid digestive gland (storage), ovary (maturation) and tail muscle profiles were examined during starvation and ovarian maturation and their roles examined in relation to the production of competent larvae. The digestive gland lipid content was high (70% dw) and dominated by triacylglycerol (energy source); it showed evidence of utilization during starvation but not during ovarian maturation. The digestive gland fatty acid profile resembled that of the diet, a fact that could be used to identify preferred wild lobster diets, i.e., through the use of dietary lipid signatures. A potential method to ascertain a range of beneficial nutritional products that may assist larval competence in wild caught larvae. The ovary and tail muscle were resilient to dietary changes in lipid or fatty acid profile, with the tail muscle approximating that of newly-hatched phyllosoma. This study demonstrated that J. edwardsii are effective in obtaining their lipid requirements in spite of minimal dietary input and reduces the emphasis on lipids and fatty acids in the nutrition of J. edwardsii broodstock. 
 
 A study to ascertain the benefit of supplementary AA during broodstock maturation found that ovarian AA concentration was easily saturated, and in the absence of supplementation was sequestered from the tail muscle, the first time this has been considered as a significant AA store. There was minimal AA utilization during embryonic development, no improvement to broodstock fecundity or phyllosoma competency suggesting that there are no reproductive or larval competency benefits to providing supplementary AA to broodstock. In contrast, the delivery of mega-doses of AA to newly-hatched phyllosoma via juvenile Artemia resulted in large increases to larval AA content (161,2250g, g-1) and concomitant increases in larval survival (74%). This is the first time Artemia enrichment protocols have resulted in an improvement to larval survival. 
 
 This thesis has identified factors which contribute to the production of competent phyllosoma larvae; a dietary mix of live and pellet feed is sufficient to supply the lipid and AA requirements of broodstock, large females producing large eggs and phyllosoma should be targeted as broodstock, while incubation should be conducted under conditions of ambient temperature. The development of an activity test is an effective tool that provides a quick and easy determination of larval competency at hatch, capable of enhancement by feeding with juvenile Artemia supplemented with a particulate form of AA. Adoption of these procedures should ensure the most competent larvae are available to improve the success of phyllosoma larval rearing in the spiny lobster J. edwardsii.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">300700 Fisheries Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/29</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/29/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/29/2/02Whole.pdf</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">From Immunology to Social Policy: Epistemology and Ethics in the creation and administration of paediatric vaccines</field><field name="creator">Mercae, A</field><field name="description">This thesis presents an extensive cross-disciplinary exploration of literature appraising epistemological and ethical issues relevant to the current status of paediatric immunisation.

Original insights are drawn from the synthesis of information provided by each of these areas, and future directions are suggested for research and policy formulation. Recently advanced theories on the function of the immune system are evaluated in relation to trends in vaccine creation. The current state of knowledge regarding neonatal tolerance, immunological memory, and vaccine design is analysed. The complexities of both immunological and epidemiological measurements of vaccine efficacy are outlined, and suggestions are made on improvements to study design and comparability of data. Ethical issues such as community versus individual rights, the reporting of adverse events, financial incentive schemes, the linking of immunisation with access to other public services such as education and welfare, and the influence of the profit requirements of trans-national corporations are addressed. The effectiveness of immunisation as a prevention of infectious disease is evaluated in relation to broad-based socio-economic influences on public health.

The research discussed in this work has two main streams. The first is the creation of a practical sign classification system, suitable for use within a sign language training system or other applications based on hand gestures. The second is an exploration of the suitability of neural networks for the creation of a real-time classification system with the ability to process temporal patterns.  Sign languages such as Auslan are the primary form of communication between members of the Deaf community. However these languages are not widely known outside of these communities, and hence a communications barrier can exist between Deaf and hearing people. The techniques for recognising signs developed in this research allow the creation of systems which can help to eliminate this barrier, either by providing computer tools to assist in the learning of sign language, or potentially the creation of portable sign-language-to-speech translation systems.  Artificial neural networks have proved to be an extremely useful approach to pattern classification tasks, but much of the research in this field has concentrated on relatively simple problems. Attempting to apply these networks to a complex real-world problem such as sign language recognition exposed a range of issues affecting this classification technique. The development of the SLARTI system inspired the creation of several new techniques related to neural networks, which have general applicability beyond this particular application. This thesis includes discussion of techniques related to issues such as input encoding, improving network generalisation, training recurrent networks and developing modular, extensible neural systems.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">280200 Artificial Intelligence and Signal and Image Processing</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/37</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/37/1/vamplew-thesis.pdf</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effective Run-Time Management of Parallelism in a Functional Programming Context</field><field name="creator">Dermoudy, J</field><field name="description">This thesis considers how to speed up the execution of functional programs using parallel execution, load distribution, and speculative evaluation.  This is an important challenge given the increasing complexity of software systems, the decreasing cost of individual processors, and the appropriateness of the functional paradigm for parallelisation.  Processor speeds are continuing to climb &#226;&#128;&#148; but the magnitudes of increase are overridden by both the increasing complexity of software and the escalating expectation of users.  Future gains in speed are likely to occur through the combination of today&#226;&#128;&#153;s conventional uni-processors to form loosely-coupled multicomputers.  Parallel program execution can theoretically provide linear speed-ups, but for this theoretical benefit to be realised two main hurdles must be overcome.  The first of these is the identification and extraction of parallelism within the program to be executed.  The second hurdle is the runtime management and scheduling of the parallel components to achieve the speed-up without slowing the execution of the program.  Clearly a lot of work can be done by the programmer to &#226;&#128;&#152;parallelise&#226;&#128;&#153; the algorithm.  There is often, however, much parallelism available without significant effort on the part of the programmer.  Functional programming languages and compilers have received much attention in the last decade for the contributions possible in parallel executions.  Since the semantics of languages from the functional programming paradigm manifest the Church-Rosser property (that the order of evaluation of sub-expressions does not affect the result), sub-expressions may be executed in parallel.  The absence of side-effects and the lack of state facilitate the availability of expressions suitable for concurrent evaluation.  Unfortunately, such expressions may involve varying amounts of computation or require high amounts of data &#226;&#128;&#148; both of which complicate the management of parallel execution.  If the future of computation is through the formation of multicomputers, we are faced with the high probability that the number of available processing units will quickly outweigh the known parallelism of an algorithm at any given moment during execution.  Intuitively this spare processing power should be utilised if possible.  The premise of speculative evaluation is that it employs otherwise idle tasks on work that may prove beneficial.  The more program components available for execution the greater the opportunity for speculation and potentially the quicker the program&#226;&#128;&#153;s result may be obtained.  The second impediment for the parallel execution of programs is the scheduling of program components for evaluation.  Multicomputer execution of a program involves the allocation of program components among the available tasks to maximise throughput.  We present a decentralised, speculation-cognate, load distribution algorithm that allocates and manages the distribution of program components among the tasks with the co-aim of minimising the impact on tasks executing program components known to be required.  In this dissertation we present our implementation of minimal-impact speculative evaluation in the context of the functional programming language Haskell augmented with a number of primitives for the indication of useful parallelism.  We expound four (two quantitative and two qualitative) novel schemes for expressing the initial speculative contribution of program components and provide a translation mechanism to illustrate the equivalence of the four.  The implementation is based on the Glasgow Haskell Compiler (GHC) version 0&#226;&#128;&#162;29 &#226;&#128;&#148; the de facto standard for parallel functional programming research &#226;&#128;&#148; and strives to minimise the runtime overhead of managing speculative evaluation.  We have augmented the Graph reduction for a Unified Machine model (GUM) runtime system with our load distribution algorithm and speculative evaluation sub-system.  Both are motivated by the need to facilitate speculative evaluation without adversely impacting on program components directly influencing the program&#226;&#128;&#153;s result.  Experiments have been undertaken using common benchmark programs.  These programs have been executed under sequential, conservative parallel, and speculative parallel evaluation to study the overheads of the runtime system and to show the benefits of speculation. The results of the experiments conducted using an emulated multicomputer add evidence of the usefulness of speculative evaluation in general and effective speculative evaluation in particular.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">280300 Computer Software</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/67</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/67/1/Dermoudy_PhD.pdf</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Oceanographic Influence of Sedimentation on the Continental Shelf: A Numerical Comparison Between Tropical and Antarctic Environments.</field><field name="creator">Hemer, M</field><field name="description">Sedimentation of two contrasting continental shelf environments have been investigated. Numerical ocean models were used to assess the oceanic processes which dominate Torres Strait and the Gulf of Papua, Northern Australia, and then the ocean cavity beneath the Amery Ice Shelf, East Antarctica.
 
 A three-dimensional, numerical ocean model (MECO) was applied to the Torres Strait/Gulf of Papua region at 0:05 degree resolution. Validation of the model was carried out against current meter and sea-level observational data. Dispersal pathways of sediments, derived from the Fly River, Papua New Guinea, and from a resuspension event on the Northern Great Barrier Reef, into Torres Strait were investigated via the introduction of passive tracers into the model. Sediment input into Torres Strait is found to be greater during the Trade season by approximately 10%. Wave data was also obtained, and together with hydrodynamic model output, sediment mobility due to currents, waves and wave-current interactions was considered for both the Trade and Monsoon seasons. Sediment mobility in the Gulf of Papua is dominated by wave motion, whereas Torres Strait is a mixed environment of waves and tidal currents.
 
 Two numerical ocean models were applied to the Amery Ice Shelf/Prydz Bay region to determine the oceanic processes responsible for the distribution of marine sediments beneath the ice shelf. The MECO model was used to determine the sub-ice-shelf tidal environment. A modified version of the Princeton Ocean Model was applied to determine the baroclinic circulation beneath the ice shelf. Validation of the tides within each model was carried out against available current meter data and sea-level records. Spring tidal currents (up to 10-15 cm/sec) are approximately two to three times the magnitude of the maximum density-driven flows (5-6 cm/sec). However, the influence of tides on the mean sub-ice-shelf melt-rates, and the mean density-driven currents, was shown to be insignificant. Thermohaline flows dominate the predicted mean sub-ice-shelf circulation and indicate a depth-integrated mass transport of 0.2 Sv, of the same order of magnitude as the overturning circulation. Combined tidal and density-driven maximum bottom currents are too small (up to 16 cm/sec)to remobilise sediments.
 
 Sediments were collected from beneath, and directly in front of, the Amery Ice Shelf. The observed sub-ice-shelf surface sediment distribution supports the dispersal pathways of diatoms beneath the ice shelf, predicted using the baroclinic model. The sediment core collected from beneath the eastern side of the Amery Ice Shelf in a region of predicted inflow (site AM02) contains a Holocene-age, siliceous mud and ooze layer, providing evidence that landward transport of hemipelagic sediments occurs beneath the Amery Ice Shelf. An imposed increase in the ocean temperature in the baroclinic model predicts increased melt rates at the ice-ocean interface, and a strengthened sub-ice-shelf circulation. An increase in sea-ice associated diatom deposition during the mid-Holocene is interpreted from AM02 down-core changes in the diatom assemblage. Results of the hydrodynamic model suggest the diatom signal may be a response to increased temperatures which may have occurred during the mid-Holocene climatic optimum.
 
 The dominant processes acting in the two continental shelf environments are able to be distinguished from each other allowing separate classification; the Torres Strait/Gulf of Papua environment is classified as a wave- and tide-dominated shelf, and the Prydz Bay/sub-Amery Ice Shelf environment is classified as a density-driven current-dominated continental shelf, and is probably typical of Antarctic shelf environments.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">260400 Oceanography</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/96</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/96/1/thesis_cor.pdf</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Peer to Peer Supply Chain Network</field><field name="creator">Goldsmith, B</field><field name="description">Many   papers   have   speculated   on   the   possibility   of   applying   peer-to-peer networking  concepts to networks  that  exist  in  the  physical  world  such  as  financial markets,   business   or   personal   communication  and  ad  hoc   networking.

The fact that Rolland preferred composers he considered heroic such as Beethoven and Handel led the author of this thesis to believe that there may be a link, as yet unexplored, between Rolland's formulation of heroism and music. The aim of this thesis is to demonstrate that musical influences and the life of certain composers played a central role in the fashioning of Rolland's concept of heroism. The first chapter, Rolland's musical formation covers the formative years of Rolland's life, outlining the development of his musical taste and also his interest in heroism. The influence of his mentor, Malwida von Meysenbug is examined, as is his search for a role model heroic figure. Beethoven, the second chapter, discusses the influence of this composer in Rolland's life and enumerates the musician's heroic qualities which Rolland adapts for the formulation of his own fictional hero. The biography The Life of Beethoven written by the author is also examined. The third chapter, Other heroic musicians investigates Rolland's musicological works in order to highlight heroic qualities found in other composers admired by Rolland. In his most famous work Jean-Christophe, Rolland creates his own heroic figure based on characteristics gleaned from his study of musicians. The character of his protagonist is examined in detail in the fourth chapter, Jean-Christophe. Many composers are criticised by the author for lacking an heroic nature. In order to develop fully the concept of Rolland's hero, a close examination of these 'non-heroic' composers is made in the fifth chapter, The insincerity of musicians. So inspired was Rolland by Beethoven that in writing Jean-Christophe, the author endeavoured to write his own literary 'Heroic Symphony'. The sixth chapter, Rolland's heroic symphony investigates how the author 'musically' structured his novel. The final chapter, Romain Rolland, the hero-prophet discusses how Rolland absorbed many of the heroic qualities that he read about, believing that it was his mission to lead an heroic life and to write inspirational works for his readers.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">420000 Language and Culture</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/209</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/209/1/01Front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/209/2/02Whole.pdf</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The evolution of knowledge</field><field name="creator">Hoerr, W</field><field name="description">This thesis will argue that there exists a unit of cultural knowledge (the meme) that is analogous to the genre of biological evolution. Genetic knowledge has been gained through the interaction of ancestral organisms with their environments. Those organisms with inferior genetic knowledge have died out. Cultural knowledge has also been gained through the interaction of new ideas within minds. Inferior cultural knowledge has died out. Genes, through their phenotypes, evolve in a physical environment while memes, through their phenotype, thought, evolve in a mental environment. Both vary in their respective environments, and the differential survival of these variations represents a single process underlying gene and meme multiplication. Because the units of knowledge, genes and memes, operate in distincively different environments, and so manifest themselves in different ways, there appear to some people to be two distinctive processes operating. One task of this thesis will be to establish logically this single process. I will show that memes are living units inhabiting a sea of minds in which they compete for survival just as organisms compete for their survival in their physical environment. In using the 'meme' I am not assuming any new physical forces, rather, the meme is a different way of seeing an old problem; cultural evolution. Through this view, contemporary problems can be seen in a new light, and in many cases, better explanations found for them.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">270200 Genetics</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/210</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/210/1/01Front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/210/2/02Whole.pdf</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Phytochemistry of Eucalyptus spp. and its role in insect-host-tree selection</field><field name="creator">Li, H</field><field name="description">Leaf oils and waxes of 29 native Tasmanian Eucalyptus species were studied from primarily a taxonomic aspect and their effects on insect-plant selection were evaluated. E. nitens, an important introduced pulpwood species that is not indigenous to Tasmania was also investigated in detail. 
 
 The chemical compositions of leaf oils and waxes of both juvenile and adult leaf samples of each species were examined by GC-MS. Results indicated that the distribution of both oil and wax components within Tasmanian eucalypts and their relative proportions between subgenera and species have taxonomic importance. A chemotaxonomic classification based on these data was constructed and this classification more functionally describes insect-host-tree relationships as opposed to the classification based on morphological differences.
 
 The results of this study indicated that differences in leaf oils of eucalypt species are correlated to genetic divergence in the biosynthesis of terpenoid compounds and that biochemically related terpenoid compounds provide sensitive taxonomic characteristics for the identification of eucalypt species. A study, using material from species/provenance trials, indicated that seasonal variation in leaf oil chemicals was influenced by time, ontogenetic and physiological aging effects. The variation pattern of leaf oils between different species was found to be under strong genetic control and environmental factors tended to affect leaf oils quantitatively but not qualitatively.
 
 For the first time the chemical composition of eucalypt leaf waxes of trees from a large number of species localities has been determined by the direct analysis of crude wax. In a representative number of species localities, wax morphology was examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Two general wax categories, amorphous and structured were found, the latter including three types. The results indicated that wax structure was correlated with chemical composition and that the distribution and variation ,- in both wax chemicals and wax types has relevance at all levels of the taxonomic hierarchy.
 
 The chemical composition of leaf oils and waxes among most provenances and localities of E. nitens were examined. The differences in leaf oil characteristics of two forms of E. nitens has supported the separation of the two morphological forms into separate species, E. nitens and E. denticulata. Results indicated that the chemical composition of leaf oils and waxes of E. nitens was similar to most Symphyomyrtus species but that oil yields from all E. nitens populations were significantly lower. 
 
 Commercially important eucalypt species are attacked by two paropsine defoliating beetles: Chrysophtharta bimaculata and C. agricola (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae, Paropsini). The feeding and oviposition preferences of these beetles and the feeding response of their larvae to eucalypt leaves were examined in laboratory bioassay in which the effects of leaf oils and waxes were evaluated. The results indicated that leaf acceptance or rejection by C. bimaculata and C. agricola was correlated to differences in leaf oils and waxes which were chemotaxonomically correlated among Tasmanian eucalypt species. The toxic effects of 1,8-cineole and related chemicals on C. bimuculata beetles were confirmed by leaf extract and chemical bioassay. It was found that the leaves of E. nitens were successfully attacked by C. bimuculata through the lack of chemical defence, notably low levels of 1,8-cineole. The wax bloom on juvenile foliage acts also as a physical defence against adult C. bimaculata beetles. Results also indicated that leaf preference of C. agricola was related more to variation in the triterpenoid class of wax chemicals.
 
 The inheritance of leaf oils and waxes in interspecific F1 hybrids of Eucalyptus was analysed. Results indicated that both oil and wax chemicals were strongly inherited in F1 hybrids and were valuable for identification of tree hybrids. Bioassay results indicated that feeding resistance was related to the inheritance of leaf oils in interspecific F1 hybrids. Hybrids between high and low cineole species had intermediate cineole levels and were therefore more resistant to C. bimaculata attack than the low cineole parent.</field><field name="date">1994</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">270400 Botany</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/211</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/211/1/01Front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/211/2/02Section1.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/211/3/03Section2.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/211/4/04Append.pdf</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Condition indicators for Antarctic krill, Euphasia superba</field><field name="creator">Shin, HC</field><field name="description">Antarctic krill use a variety of strategies to cope with, and thrive in the highly variable Southern Ocean environment. Despite much detailed information on its basic biology produced so far, the linkages between krill populations and the environment are yet to be systematically investigated. There is a practical need to have standardised indicators to assess the 'condition' of krill in relation to seasonal cycles and shifts in physical regimes and this study has aimed to develop such indicators.  The level of nucleic acids in abdominal tissue was determined as an estimator of growth rates of individual krill that could otherwise only be obtained by on-board experiments. The dynamics of the major digestive organ, the digestive gland, in its size, protein and lipid content and enzyme activities, were examined in relation to changing food regimes. The potential of using eye diameter as a long-term starvation indicator was also examined.  The amount of RNA and RNA:DNA ratio in krill muscle exhibited a significant relationship with individual growth rates, although the predictability was only modest. This was the case with both field-caught specimens and experimental juveniles. RNA-based indices were clearly different between well-fed, high-growth krill and underfed low-growth krill, and the RNA content levelled off when the growth rates became negative. The moult cycle had no significant effect on nucleic acid content. Overall, the content of nucleic acids varied considerably between individuals. Starved krill also tended to have higher DNA per unit biomass, which implies shrinkage of cells rather than loss of cells. The experimental krill showed a rapid response to the food conditions in their growth rates, either in a positive or negative direction, well within a single moult cycle.  The digestive enzyme activities in the digestive gland of field-caught adults decreased considerably during one week of starvation. The size of the gland decreased substantially both in length and weight, accompanied by a loss of lipid and protein, with the former being more readily utilised. In a laboratory experiment where juvenile krill were alternately fed and starved, the digestive enzyme activities changed in response to the food regime. These changes largely mirrored the mass gain and loss of the digestive glands. The gland size-specific activities of digestive enzymes showed no consistent trends even after a long period of starvation. When the food supply was resumed, the gland regained its mass and enzyme activities. The digestive gland appears to serve as a reserve, which can provide against a few days' starvation and be rebuilt relatively quickly. Its size showed a prompt and steady response to short-term changes in feeding regime, proving a reliable indicator of recent feeding activities.  By tracking individuals over time and examining specimens sampled as groups, it was demonstrated that fed and starved krill are distinguishable by the relationship between the eye diameter and body length. The eye diameter of starved krill did not decrease even when the animals were shrinking in overall body length. The eye digmeter of well-fed krill continued to increase as overall length increased. This created a distinction between fed and starved krill while no simultaneous separation was detected in terms of the body length to weight relationship. It would take approximately 2 moult cycles of shrinkage or more at modest rates for the eye diameter to body length relationship to significantly change. Whether this feature is manifested in the wild would be best seen at the end of winter, after the most likely period of extended food limitation.  Nucleic acid content has only limited predictive power as an estimator of growth rates. Growth rates measured by the 'instantaneous growth rate' technique are still the best representation of in situ growth, which is determined by the condition during the period since the last moult. The size of the digestive gland of krill, a crucial short-term storage organ, was more responsive to food condition than enzyme activities. The gland size is a result of feeding activities over the past few weeks and will not be affected by immediate past events such as cod-end feeding. The digestive gland size should, at least, be a simple measure of whether krill have recently undergone severe, sustained food shortage. Long-term, seasonal starvation and the shrinkage it caused over a few moult cycles can be seen in the body length to eye diameter relationship more obviously than the traditional body length to weight relationship. This suite of measurements will provide a matrix of methods to determine the 'condition' of krill, in time scales from a week to a few months. These techniques are now ready for repeated measurements in the field over wider temporal and spatial extent to examine their applicability and to contribute to unravelling the outstanding questions in krill biology.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">300700 Fisheries Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/212</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/212/1/01Front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/212/2/02Whole.pdf</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Industrial democracy and employee participation in Australia</field><field name="creator">Mahony, JT</field><field name="description">This paper on industrial democracy and employee participation aims at reaching a conclusion on the likely future of these concepts in this country over say, the next decade. An integral part of this aim will be some observations on what might be the most appropriate form(s) which will serve the wide-ranging interests of the protagonists and what strategy options might be available to encourage and facilitate an expansion of participative practices.  The approach adopted relies on a search of the extant literature including research findings and reviews, theoretical analyses, documented experiences and comments and observations by a wide range of writers on the subject. From these sources a background of historical and current expectations, attitudes and activities is built up to provide the basis for the conclusions which this paper aims to make. Worker alienation in industry has been debated since Karl Marx wrote of the plight of workers under industrial capitalism. Alienation exists and can be identified when 'workers are unable to control their immediate work processes, to develop a sense of'purpose and function which connects their job to the overall organisation of production, to belong to integrated industrial communities and when they.fai1 to become involved in the activity of work as a mode of personal self-expression'.Alienation is characterised by powerlessness, meaninglessness, isolation and selfestrangement.  The concept of alienation is still of importance throughout the world today and seems to be reduced significantly by the introduction of participative practices directly involving the worker. There is an impressive array of research findings which show consistently that satisfaction in work is enhanced by a genuine increase in workers' decision-making power. Since the days of the industrial revolution few ideas have persisted and been pursued from a multitude of directions as some form of democracy in the arena of industrial labour. Clearly, the concept is one of long standing and there are a number of compelling reasons why it should be addressed by contemporary society.  In general, the case for industrial democracy and worker participation rests on a number of arguments which may be classified as the political, moral and economic arguments. The political argument relates to the need to extend democracy from the political to the industrial arena and this can be achieved by allowing workers to have a greater say in decision making at work.  The moral argument is about the need to provide for the personal development and satisfaction of individual worker. The several tenets of democracy, viz., freedom of expression, access to information, participation and equality, must be the prerogative of everyone if we are to have a truly democratic society. These principles must extend into every facet of life, not least of all, the workplace. Efforts to improve the quality of worklife must be regarded as a social issue because it impacts on the lives of such a large proportion of the population. The moral argument is of such fundamental importance and has such far reaching implications for society that the case for industrial democracy and participation conceivably could be justified on this ground alone.  Finally, the economic argument relates to the belief that participation will improve productivity and industrial relations. One of the prime reasons advanced is that participation fosters a more cooperative attitude between workers and management which raises productivity by reducing industrial stoppages. It can be argued that this concept of using participation to improve productivity looks upon the worker as a special kind of factor of production and whose special characteristics must be taken into account if effectiveness is to be maximised. This contrasts with the view that democracy is a right of the worker.  The continuing debate suggests that there are some basic human problems of industrial organisation for which various concepts of industrial democracy and participation are seen as possible solutions. In essence, the debate indicates that the fundamental concerns relate to the sharing of power between workers and management; effective co-operation between all members of an enterprise in the interests of efficiency and effectiveness and/or industrial harmony; and the personal fulfillment of the members of the enterprise. There is adequate justification for the debate to be continued and intensified in this country. Certainly, in recent years there has been renewed interest in the subject brought about largely by the need for improved competitiveness and efficiency and by the demands of a better educated and organised workforce for greater involvement in those aspects which impact upon their worklife. The relevance of this paper is thus will established.  The subject is approached by firstly examining in Chapter 2 definitions, forms and levels of implementation of participation. Understanding the concepts involved is of greater importance than lengthy definitional debates but clarification of the meanings of the terms 'industrial democracy' and 'employee participation' does facilitate further discussion. Along with these considerations the chapter also examines the primary forms of participation and whether there is any relationship between the form of participation practised and the level within the enterprise at which this occurs. Chapter 3 analyses three models of participation in use in development, implementation and effectiveness of such schemes and to ascertain what lessons these hold for the development of participatory schemes in Australia. Three European schemes have been selected, viz., joint consultation, co-determination and worker management, as they represent quite a broad spectrum of participatory processes. Contemporary Australian developments are examined in Chapter 4 to determine the form, content and thrust of the activities undertaken, the current state of progress including the attitudes of the principal parties and whether there has been any shift in direction and/or emphasis since the early 1970's.. Chapter 5 then provides information about specific Australian experiences with the European models of participation dealt with in Chapter 3 together with the effectiveness of these models in the Australian industrial environment. It seems that the way ahead in Australia will be predicated on the basis of factors such as the attitudes and actions of governments, employers and unions; the experiences of the last decade or so and the barriers to an expansion of democracy in the workplace. Chapter 6 examines these factors to determine the likely future of the democratisation of work and the strategy options available to encourage and facilitate an expansion of participatory practices.</field><field name="date">1988</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">350200 Business and Management</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/216</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/216/1/01Front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/216/2/02Whole.pdf</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of juvenile foraging ecology and growth in the evolution of life history strategies for southern elephant seals</field><field name="creator">Field, IC</field><field name="description">In highly dynamic and unpredictable environments such as the Southern Ocean, species that have evolved behaviours that reduce the effects of intra-specific competition may have a selective advantage. This is particularly true when juveniles face disadvantages when foraging due to morphological or physiological limitation, such as in the case of many marine mammals. Southern elephant seals (Mirounga leonina) are a major consumer of biomass in the Southern Ocean with a global distribution. Recent modelling of the Macquarie Island population concluded that juvenile survival is a key parameter in influencing the rates of population change and as an important demographic component of the population. Resource limitation has been suggested as the primary reason for the change in numbers of these populations and this coupled with the importance of juvenile rates of survival influencing population change may provide some insight into explaining any reduction in juvenile survival. Until now, little has been known about these juveniles, ontogenetic and intra-specific differences in life history and foraging ecology have been suggested but not investigated. During this juvenile stage individuals undergo many morphometric and physiological changes as they develop toward maturity. Therefore, it would seem likely that studying the foraging ecology and growth and development patterns of this demographic group may show the proximate processes in affecting population dynamics. This study has followed juvenile seals as they grow and develop rapidly toward adulthood observing changes in foraging areas or strategies and associated changes in prey availability, differences in the seasonal availability of prey, changes in morphology and physiology for growth, maintenance or provisioning toward adulthood. In this thesis I present data for:  1) Anaesthesia for safe handling - I assessed the effects of variation in body condition and age at on the characteristics of anaesthesia, including induction time and dose-specific recovery rate which has increased the control over immobilisation level and duration, and reduces handling times for wild pinnipeds.  2) Foraging range and 3) Habitat use of the Southern Ocean -I tracked the at-sea movements of juvenile southern elephant seals using locations derived from recorded light levels.  4) Diet - I describe intra-specific dietary differences in prey composition and size. 5) Metabolic estimates and energy use and 6) Growth and body condition changes - I examined changes in mass and body composition of juvenile southern elephant seals during and between their annual moult and mid-year haul-outs. General discussion - These key ecological areas of an important predator has increased our understanding of the evolutionary and ecological interactions that influence the population dynamics of southern elephant seals at Macquarie Island and the structure of the Southern Ocean ecosystem.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">270700 Ecology and Evolution</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/217</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/217/1/01Front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/217/2/02Whole.pdf</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Flavobacteria in the Southern Ocean</field><field name="creator">Abell, GCJ</field><field name="description">The abundance, spatial distribution and diversity of class Flavobacteria, a bacterial group with a major role in marine secondary production, was investigated in the Southern Ocean euphotic zone of the ice pack off Eastern Antarctica and along a transect at 140-144 degrees East between latitudes 44.7 degrees South to 63.5 degrees South. Samples were comparatively analysed using 16S rRNA gene-based denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), fluorescent in situ hybridisation, real-time PCR and sequence analysis. The results were subsequently compared with direct cultivation approaches.
 
 Surface seawater samples were filter-fractionated into particulate and planktonic fractions and the abundance of particle-associated Flavobacteria, ascertained with real-time PCR and DGGE band analysis using Flavobacteriaspecific primers. Flavobacteria abundance was found to be significantly higher in Polar Front Zone (PFZ) and Antarctic Zone (AZ) water samples compared to warmer, nutrient limited Temperate Zone (TZ) and Sub-Antarctic Zone (SAZ) waters. Abundance of particle-associated Flavobacteria positively correlated with seawater chlorophyll a and nutrient concentrations. The abundance of planktonic Flavobacteria populations in the same samples remained relatively static, suggesting increased Flavobacteria abundance may relate to enhanced primary production in the PFZ and AZ. This was supported by comparisons of DGGE profiles that demonstrated significant differences occur in the total Flavobacteria community structure and 16S rRNA gene diversity between samples from the PFZ and AZ with samples from the TZ and SAZ. This suggests a shift to a different, more psychrophilic Flavobacteria community occurs across the Polar Front in the Southern Ocean.
 
 DGGE band sequences revealed a high diversity of class Flavobacteria within the Southern Ocean, with 24 genus-level lineages detected. Several of the phylotype clades detected were cosmopolitan in distribution, present in both polar and temperate oceans. Many of the phylotypes clustered in a large, so far uncultivated clade (previously termed DE cluster 2) widely distributed in seawater but apparently absent from sea-ice. Cosmopolitan phylotype clades occurred throughout the Southern Ocean, while several additional phylotype groups were found only in the colder waters of the PFZ and AZ. Examination of the cultivable diversity of Flavobacteria in Southern Ocean water samples, using a range of growth media, revealed a number of unique phylotypes including three novel genera, some grouping in clades for which only clones are currently available. Several other strains represented novel species belonging to the family Flavobacteriaceae, grouping in the genera Psychroserpens, Polaribacter and Tenacibaculum. A number of seawater microcosms were utilized to examine the colonization of bacteria-free diatom detritus by planktonic bacterial communities over a period of 30 days at 2 degrees Celsius. Flavobacteria phylotypes colonizing diatom detritus, determined by DGGE and real-time PCR analysis, were homologous with the dominant phylotypes in the particle-associated fraction of the samples from which they were taken. Colonisation occurred rapidly (less than 5 days) and comprised a succession of phylotypes, representing a diversity of Flavobacteria lineages. The increasing colonization corresponded to an increase in the dissolution of silicic acid compared with the corresponding control microcosms</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">270300 Microbiology</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/219</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/219/1/01Front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/219/2/02Whole.pdf</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Aboriginal society in North West Tasmania : dispossession and genocide</field><field name="creator">McFarlane, I</field><field name="description">As the title indicates this study is restricted to those Aboriginal tribes located in the North West region of Tasmania. This approach enables the regional character and diversity of Aboriginal communities to be brought into focus; it also facilitates an examination of the unique process of dispossession that took place in the North West region, an area totally under the control of the Van Diemen's Land Company (VDL Co). Issues dealing with entitlement to ownership and sovereignty will be established by an examination of the structure and function of traditional Aboriginal Societies in the region, as well as the occupation and use they made of their lands. Early contact history with the Europeans is examined to demonstrate that there was a real possibility of developing productive relationships with the indigenous inhabitants at the time the VDL Co. took up their land grants.  The character of the VDL Co manager Edward Curr, his role in the development of the VDL Co and his harsh treatment of those under his authority, including the Aborigines is also an important area of study. While Company Directors were prepared to countenance the dispossession of the Aborigines and consequent destruction of their culture, Curr was content to preside over their physical destruction. This thesis will demonstrate that Edward Curr persistently ignored instructions from his Directors to the contrary and created, fostered and supported an ethos that encouraged the systematic eradication of the Aboriginal population on allocated Company lands. In 1834, after only eight years under the care of Curr's administration, less than one sixth of the original Aboriginal inhabitants had survived to be taken into exile by the Friendly Mission.  Robinson's Friendly Mission provided the main physical contact between the North West Aborigines and Arthur's administration. Thus the activities of the Friendly Mission and its role in removing many of the Aborigines, by force in many cases, is detailed, as is their treatment and condition at the Wybalenna Establishment.  The history of the North West Aboriginal tribes will continue by tracing the events and experiences that followed the exile to Flinders Island and Oyster Cove, concluding with the death in 1857 of the last survivor of the North West population. It will be established that the genocide perpetrated against these tribes, was initiated as part of local VDL Co policy, a process exacerbated through colonial administrative expediency and brought to completion by neglect.  Finally, there is a brief review of the popular ideologies concerning race, current during the period under study and the extent to which these ideas moulded attitudes and policies relating to Aborigines both in the North West and in general.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">370300 Anthropology</field><field name="subject">430100 Historical Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/220</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/220/1/01Front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/220/2/02Whole.pdf</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Predictive models for integrated pest management of the leaf beetle Chrysophtharta bimaculata in Eucalyptus nitens plantations in Tasmania</field><field name="creator">Candy, SG</field><field name="description">The Tasmanian Eucalyptus leaf beetle, Chrysophtharta bimaculata (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) is the most important phytophagous insect pest of eucalypts in Tasmania regularly defoliating new season&#8217;s growth over large areas of forest. An integrated pest management (IPM) system is currently in operation to minimise economic losses from defoliation of Eucalyptus nitens plantations due to browsing by larvae. However, the utility of the IPM system has been limited by the lack of : (a) an efficient sampling scheme for population monitoring, (b) the ability to predict an &#8216;action threshold&#8217; (i.e. the population density for which it is profitable to apply insecticide at a standard rate), and (c) the ability to predict C. bimaculata population phenology. This study attempted to rectify this situation by developing predictive models that were calibrated using data from a number of sources including that obtained from a caged-shoot, larval feeding trial and from stage-frequency sampling carried out by the author.
 
 Sampling schemes for monitoring egg populations were investigated using (i) counts of the number of leaves occupied by one or more egg batches for a sample of shoots and trees where the total number of leaves on each shoot was unknown [&#8216;occupied leaf count&#8217; (OLC) sampling], (ii) counts of the number of occupied trees for a known total sample size (binomial sampling), and (iii) double sampling using a combination of both (i) and (ii). Novel statistical methods were employed in developing these sampling schemes. For OLC sampling, the current multi-stage technique for modelling the variance of the counts using either Taylor&#8217;s power law (TPL) or Iwao&#8217;s regression was compared to single-stage modelling using generalised linear mixed models (GLMMs). To do this, GLMMs were extended to incorporate a negative binomial variance function. Efficiency of estimation of TPL was improved by using a more accurate approximation to the variance of the marginal mean. For binomial sampling, William&#8217;s method III of handling over-dispersion in a binomial generalised linear model is shown to have theoretical and practical advantages over current methods that use simple linear regression.
 
 Models of the growth of E. nitens, with and without browsing by larvae, were developed at the leaf, shoot, tree, and stand level. The models included (i) a leaf expansion model, (ii) a process model of the impact of larval browsing on total shoot leaf area incorporating (i) above and calibrated using data from the caged-shoot feeding trial, and (iii) a model of the impact of defoliation level on the growth of tree diameter and height calibrated using data from artificial defoliation trials. A method of predicting action thresholds for insecticide application from inputs of initial stand conditions, silvicultural regime, cost of control, stumpage value, and cash discount rate was developed. This involved the comparison of growth predicted from existing stand and tree growth models for E. nitens with that obtained by combining those models with the browsing and defoliation impact models (ii) and (iii).
 
 Models of (i) egg and larval development rate as a function of ambient field temperature and (ii) the progression of the population through key life stages (egg to final instar larvae) were constructed. Maximum likelihood estimation was used for (i) based on interval-censored development times. Continuation ratio models for (ii), incorporating physiological time based on the models for (i) and calibrated using the stage-frequency data, were used to estimate time of peak occurrence of each of first, second, and third instar larvae. The models and estimation methods used are shown to have advantages over those currently used in population studies.
 
 Finally, the practical application of this suite of predictive models for decision support within the leaf beetle IPM system was demonstrated. For a typical 15-year rotation pulpwood regime on a site of average quality with a discount rate of 8%, a cost of control of $35/ha, and a stumpage of $30/m3, a value of 0.3 occupied leaves per shoot was the recommended action threshold. In addition, since approximately 90% of defoliation is caused by the last two (i.e. third and fourth) larval instars any application of insecticide should not be delayed past the time of the peak in the number of second instar larvae.

The myxozoan parasite Pentacapsula neurophila was described as the parasite causing the disease in the striped trumpeter juveniles. Molecular Bayesian phylogenetic analysis using small subunit ribosomal DNA (ssu rDNA) gene sequence and the covariotide evolutionary model, has shown P. neurophila to reside firmly within the clade comprised of Kudoa species, histozoic parasites of fish from the order Multivalvulida with 4 or more shell valves containing polar capsules. This has provided molecular evidence resulting in the proposed new combination of the Kudoidae to include this Pentacapsula species.  A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) diagnostic assay was developed from the ssu rDNA gene sequence to detect Kudoa neurophila (formerly known as Pentacapsula neurophila). The assay is sufficiently species specific and sensitive enough to detect a small fragment of the parasite ssu rDNA gene (0.1 spore or 60 fg DNA or 4 spores g-1 /25 microlitres PCR reaction). Specifically, the test is capable of detecting early stages of the life cycle within the fish host and consequently diagnosing an infection not normally detected using histology. The PCR test can also be used to screen water supplies and prey cultures throughout the hatchery system to determine bio-security efficacy, assist in epizootiology studies, identify infected alternative or other primary hosts indicating the location of the disease reservoir, and enable a targeted approach to disease prevention in an aquaculture situation.  Histology and in situ hybridisation techniques were incorporated into the study of the histopathology of the disease caused by this parasite to elucidate its entry point on the fish host and migratory pathway to terminal stage sporulation. Kudoa neurophila enters the fish via epithelial cells as early as 25 days post hatch (dph). Parasite cells then appear within plasmodia in skeletal muscle tissue between 50-80 dph. This appears to be the first key proliferation stage which is followed by another plasmodial stage in the peripheral nerve pathways near the spinal cord (70-115 dph). It is during this stage that clinical signs of the disease, such as whirling, become apparent. The presporogonic cells then enter the spinal cord where terminal stage sporulation occurs throughout the brain and spinal cord (105-130 dph) causing acute pathology, eventually resulting in the death of the animal.  The information gained from the research conducted in this thesis, along with incorporated epizootiology studies, form the foundation of understanding that has assisted the hatchery management team to make informed health management decisions with an outlook to produce healthy juvenile striped trumpeter for on-going research into the development of this species for marine sea cage aquaculture.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">300700 Fisheries Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/225</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/225/1/01Front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/225/2/02Whole.pdf</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigation of the Composition of Woodsmoke and Methods for Apportioning Woodsmoke to Air Pollution in Launceston</field><field name="creator">Jordan, TB</field><field name="description">Launceston, a city with a population of approximately 80,000 located in the north of Tasmania, Australia, regularly experiences high levels of air pollution during winter. Ambient PM10 (particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter smaller than 10 micrometres) levels exceed the Australian 24-hour guideline of 50 micrograms/m3 around 20-40 times during the May to September period each year. This is generally attributed to residential woodburning, with approximately one third of households using woodheaters or open fireplaces. This thesis reports on investigations into characterising and quantifying the contribution of woodsmoke to wintertime air pollution in Launceston.  An historical record of air quality in Launceston was reconstructed using polycyclicaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) as surrogates for air pollution in a dated sediment core taken from the upper Tamar Estuary. The overall depth profile showed that levels of PAHs began increasing at the end of the 19th century and have been relatively steady since the 1930s. Pyrogenic source ratios similar to woodburning were found in both atmospheric and sedimentary samples, although quantification of the woodburning contribution was not possible using PAHs alone. Factors affecting atmospheric sampling of PAHs were investigated, including the impact of sampling rate, the vapour-particle phase distribution on various components of the sampling system and degradation caused by different filter media. Because of the inability of PAHs to differentiate between fossil fuel and wood combustion there was a need to identify alternative tracers for wood combustion. A dilution tunnel was used to collect emissions from woodheaters operated with different airflow settings, and around 100 organic compounds were quantified. Although the majority of compounds were not detected in ambient air samples, levoglucosan was found to be not degraded in the atmospheric samples and was identified as a consistent tracer for woodsmoke. Levoglucosan concentrations in ambient PM10 indicated that woodheaters contributed about 80% of wintertime air pollution in Launceston.  To validate the use of levoglucosan as a tracer for woodsmoke, the contribution of biomass and fossil fuel sources of carbon to Launceston ambient aerosols was determined by measuring the carbon-14 content using accelerator mass spectrometry. Fossil sources had a relatively low and constant input irrespective of the particulate loading, consistent with transport-related emissions. Conversely, the biomass input, most likely from woodsmoke, was found to increase linearly with particulate loading, and contributed around 97-99% of the total organic carbon fraction of Launceston wintertime PM10. A modified combustion method was developed for samples collected on borosilicate filter media.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">300800 Environmental Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/226</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/226/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/226/2/02whole.pdf</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">From Market Place to Superstore: The connections between retail product, advertising method, popular culture and art.

In particular the artwork focuses on the lounge suite. Inside the Harvey Norman superstore, which stands on the site of a 19th century colonial marketplace, the retail space with its ironically palace-like dimensions is divided into a series of tableaux of methodically ordered furniture. Carefully chosen colour-coordinated accessories are arranged and lit by softly glowing lamps promoting seductively comfortable home scenarios. Glossy catalogues take the production line furniture beyond the store to demonstrate the almost seamless retail/home experience. Still life settings interact and merge with contemporary lifestyle expectations. Merchandise can be the substance of desire.  The research artwork sought to capture an art image from retailing, advertising and specific elements derived from popular commercial TV lifestyle programs. The concept of the work was to ascertain if the lounge-suite-as-image retained its aura of aesthetic expendability and collapsed into contemporary art when transferred to the white box of the gallery space. To this end digital photographs, miniaturised models, video and actual merchandise were installed in the gallery space. Using varying scales and tactility the viewer was asked to engage in an alternative retailing experience within the Academy Gallery, University of Tasmania at Inveresk.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">379900 Other Studies in Human Society</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/227</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/227/1/01Front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/227/2/02Main.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/227/3/03Appendices.pdf</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">How we talk to our children : an evaluation of parent effectiveness training for the development of emotional competence</field><field name="creator">Wood, CD</field><field name="description">Converging studies in empathic listening (Ickes, 1997), emotional intelligence (Bar-On 2000,2001) and conflict resolution (Sanson &amp; Bretherton, 2001; Alvy, 1994) point to the importance of parent training for bringing up socially competent children in a world so changed in western countries that traditional parenting practices are less than effective. Both behaviour and the ability to manage emotion can be affected by interactions with the parent in infancy (Fischer &amp; Rose, 1994) childhood and adolescence (Gottman, 1 997). Appropriate assertiveness is an important component of communication skill (Wilson &amp; Gallois, 1993). Conflict resolution skills require a combination of empathic listening, assertiveness and creative problem solving (Littlefield, Love, Peck &amp; Wertheim, 1993). Parent Effectiveness Training (PET, Gordon, 1976) focuses attention on the developnlent of empathic family relationships leading to autonomy and self-responsibility in children through parent training in empathic listening, appropriate assertiveness and conflict resolution. PET reaches over 900 parents annually around Australia, using a newly developed workbook (Wood, 1997) simplified without loss of content as part of this study. The present investigation provides an extensive study of PET in Australia using a three-group comparison (70 standard US workbook, 8 1 Australian workbook and 8 1 controls with no PET) comparing parents' pretest and posttest results with outcome measures following a PET program. Verbal and cognitive skills acquisition was measured using the Parent-Child Response Sheet (PCRS, Wood &amp; Davidson, 1987, 1994/95). Parents' family management concerns were collected through the parent-listed objectives for training and the Issues of Parental Concern (PC, Gordon, 1976; Wood, 1996) including ratings of the stress they felt about each issue on the SUDS scale (Wolpe, 1990) before and after PET. Both PET groups achieved substantially and significantly higher scores than controls on empathic listening, appropriate assertiveness and conflict resolution as measured by the PCRS. Compared with controls the PET parents showed a significantly greater reduction in levels of parental stress about their family concerns. Males scored significantly higher in listening skills using the vernacular version, although there were no statistically significant differences between the workbooks. Extensive qualitative reports indicated that parents had made satisfactory changes in I family management procedures, improved relationships with children and increased levels of family harmony. These findings confirm the conclusions of earlier research, including the meta-analysis of PET studles (Cedar &amp; Levant, 1990), and provide the fnst extensive evaluation of PET implemented at a community level in the light of emerging awareness of emotional intelligence and the need for family development of interpersonal communication skills.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">380100 Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/228</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/228/1/01Front2.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/228/2/02ChaptersOneToThree2.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/228/3/03ChaptersFourToSix2.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/228/4/04ChaptersSevenToEnd2.pdf</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Adolescent participants in a wilderness-based challenge : an evaluation of a primary and secondary prevention program</field><field name="creator">Sveen, RL</field><field name="description">A theoretical eclectic model adopting a preventive approach to address adolescents at-risk of offending was created. Salient features were then utilised to assess a primary and secondary prevention program in practice. The sample (N = 62) consisted of 44 male and 18 female voluntary adolescents between 15 and 25 years of age, from all geographical areas within Tasmania, Australia. Conducted between September 1992 and October 1994, the study utilised a quasi-experimental recurrent institutional, non-parametric (prepost- follow-up) design as a control measure, to gauge maturational changes over a 12 month period of 11 groups of participants. Program effect was established through significant post minus pre participant general self-esteem and self-actualisation gain scores. Subsequent gender analysis found that female participants attained greater initial short-term gains in areas of social self-esteem (new peer relationships) and self-actualisation (personal insights). Conversely, longitudinal gains (pre to follow) were evidenced in the male sample in areas of general and personal self-esteem. Cross-sectional age-maturational analysis found significant personal self-esteem (happiness) gains achieved longitudinally by the early (i.e. 13-15) and in the short-term by the late (i.e. 19-21) adolescent groups of both genders. On the basis of these results, it is posited that the gender neutral physical demands of this wilderness-based program assisted female adolescent participants in gaining a more accurate and positive understanding of their social and personal attributes and abilities. Adolescent males appear to begin the program with an overestimation of their physical selves. Post activity loss of bravado occurs amongst male peers, potentially signalling a less competitive atmosphere and possible opportunity for development of self. The effect of this program as a catalyst preventing prima~yp articipants initial contact with court proceedings and reducing secondary prevention participants further involvement over a twelve month period was substantiated. The program provides the stimulus to assist with the actualisation of potential, manifesting most significantly within the community in educational and employment outcomes by 68% of the participants within this sample. It is surmised that this process works as an 'anti-depressant inoculation' particularly for the more mature, in that psychological strength is attained positively influencing post behavioural patterns. Perhaps an alternative perspective is that post course euphoria leaves a lingering positive effect.

Blood in detail and three women's films</field><field name="creator">Field, E</field><field name="description">This thesis constructs an analysis of the representation of blood in a selection of American films. This analysis does not aim to construct a representative theory of blood, rather, it examines discrete instances and certain relationships between a mainstream discourse of blood and various resistances presented by women film directors. In particular these films present critical approaches to blood at the level of mise-en-scene. The specific presentation of blood works in ways that resist a realist and masculinist tradition that codes blood as a marker of the feminine. An analysis of blood in mise-en-scene is used to reflect upon wider questions of narrative. I use this methodology in the absence of film criticism identifying blood as a specific object of extended analysis. Three theoretical essays form a general backdrop to the project: Barbara Creed's influential study of horror, The Monstrous Feminine: Film, Feminism, Psychoanalysis, where blood indicates abjection, castration and the femme castratrice; Steve Neale's essay 'Masculinity as Spectacle' that reads blood as indicating disavowed homoeroticism and doomed narcissism in the Western; and Teresa de Lauretis's essay 'Desire in Narrative' where blood is a marker of the story of the mythological male subject. I isolate two films; Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho (1960) and Martin Scorsese's 'Taxi Driver'(1976) as inaugurating certain mainstream aesthetics of libidinal violence. Blood here is the paint of penetration and distorted pleasure, however blood also serves to erase a female narrative. In the three films that form the focus of the project, blood is frequently an intertextual key that undoes the overdetermined patterns it speaks to. Bette Gordon's Variety (1983) and Kathryn Bigelow's Blue Steel (1990) evoke scenes from Taxi Driver and Psycho. In Variety sex and blood are the red herrings to an open ended investigation into the scene of pornography. Blue Steel explores the allure of the gun for a female protagonist while detaching the gun from blood as libidinal. While both Variety and Blue Steel intervene into existing structures and genres, Maya Deren's Meshes of the Afternoon (1943) is an experimental film and defines itself in opposition to Hollywood cinema. However, this film serves as a postscript to the project in its poetic displacement of mise-en-scene and a female subject position. This film speaks to de Lauretis's concerns in 'Desire in Narrative' in its evocation of the myth of Perseus from the Medusa's point of view. Blood functions as a literal condensation of dreamed and lived events: it is ambivalent realisation of woman's figuration within cinematic myth.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">420300 Cultural Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/231</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/231/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/231/2/02whole.pdf</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Integration or transformation: a cross-national study of information and communication technology in school education</field><field name="creator">Fluck, A</field><field name="description">The advent of relatively cheap micro-computers in the 1980s has led to major investment in information and communication technology (ICT) for schools. The technology has been developed continually, creating a situation where there may be significant differences between policy and practice. The literature relating to innovation diffusion and the rationale for ICT in school education has concentrated upon effectiveness and teacher professional development. Existing models of development in the area are limited in scope or make ill-founded assumptions. Little work has been done on the question of alignment between policy and practice. This study used a grounded theory approach to examine the relationships between policy, implementation and underlying models of development. This was done through a process of policy comparison, consultation with experts in the field and case study observations. The methodology used a comparative case study approach at national, school and classroom levels and examined issues such as the nature of development processes for policy in the area, implementation and practice in the use of computers in classrooms, teacher professional development and stages of development as perceived by practitioners. Data were gathered from the United States of America, England, Estonia and Australia from November 1999 to September 2002. The study found ICT curriculum approaches for students were strongly aligned with a stage of development which emphasised the integration of ICT into existing curricula and current classroom practice. There was poor alignment between overlapping policies for teacher training and student learning outcomes and also between policy and classroom practice. It was confirmed that students generally have better access to computers outside school than within it, a situation largely ignored by policy. It was also found that experts in the field perceived increasing reliance upon generic office software as an outmoded tool approach, and saw ICT as a driver for transformative change in school education. School and classroom observations confirmed that local practice included transformative uses of ICT. From these findings a general model of stages of development was derived. The model consisted of an introductory Phase 1, where students in school first use computers and information technology becomes a subject choice; an integrative Phase 2, where information and communication technologies are used to enhance learning opportunities in all traditional curriculum subject areas; and a transformative Phase 3, where the curriculum clearly includes topics of study that would not exist without information and communication technologies and schooling for most students no longer fits the traditional group-instruction model. The model has implications for alignment in policy development based upon a national cross-curriculum framework. It demonstrates the importance for teacher professional development to include training in virtual teaching and the evaluation of digital materials. In particular, there is a need to examine the alignment between conventional learning outcomes, policy and practice when ICT is much more available to students outside school than within. The study provides guidance for future policies concerning teacher ICT professional development and argues for their alignment with national cross-curriculum frameworks for ICT in school education. It will also be useful for educators training pre-service teachers to use and prepare online digital learning materials. Further, the study also informs school communities about the need to use ICT as a way of linking their institution with student homes and to extend learning opportunities.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">330100 Education Studies</field><field name="subject">330300 Professional Development of Teachers</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/232</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/232/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/232/2/02whole.pdf</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Searching for the subject: new narratives through installation.</field><field name="creator">Ozolins, BT</field><field name="description">This project has visually explored the relationships between language, knowledge and subjectivity. Its conceptual foundations have been developed through an engagement with post-structural theory, literature and personal experience. Its visual language has been formed by adopting aspects of the theories of postproduction and relational aesthetics of Nicolas Bourriaud in tandem with early conceptual arts aesthetic of administration. The result of the project is a series of installations that focus on viewer experience and offer the possibility of developing new narratives about our relationship to language and knowledge. The installations incorporate already existing materials, cultural signs, objects and ideas associated with institutional practices of collecting, manipulating and disseminating information. The familiar language of bureaucracy has thus been used to create a network of seemingly interconnected scenarios that engage the viewer in the shifting roles of protagonist, subject, witness or voyeur. A sense of uncertainty and confusion is produced, evoking the idea of a fractured subjectivity in a state of limbo, a condition in which meaning is gained only through attempting to piece together the different narratives on offer. The nature of our relationship to language and knowledge is thus evoked through physical and psychological interaction as well as visual engagement with the work. The project's concern with language, knowledge and information systems harks back to the conceptual art movement of the1960s and to contemporary art's accompanying engagement with philosophy, in particular post-structuralism. Within this context, it has re-visited and re-assessed ideas about the role of language in defining contemporary subjectivity and has explored strategies for conveying those ideas through installation. From Kosuth to the Kabakovs, it references a broad spectrum of artists who have investigated related themes using an almost uncategorisable array of non-traditional materials, styles and strategies. The project has concluded that we are fragmented subjects in a state of limbo, our relationship to language and knowledge characterised by paradox, anxiety, complicity and challenge - and a continued search for meaning and wholeness despite their seeming absence. Ultimately, it has presented the viewer with an opening: a new network of possible narratives about language, knowledge and self. Although these narratives appear to be linked, they fail to come to a neat conclusion. Just as contemporary subjectivity is in a state of limbo, so too, are the scenarios depicted in the installations.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">410200 Visual Arts and Crafts</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/233</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/233/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/233/2/02parts1and2.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/233/3/03parts3and4.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/233/4/04appendices.pdf</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sustainability Indicators in Marine Capture Fisheries</field><field name="creator">Potts, T</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the development of sustainability indicator systems (SIS) as a tool to implement the concept of sustainability into fisheries management. This research focuses upon the identification and evolution of these systems, their application as a management tool, and their response to problems in fisheries sustainability. The thesis presents a series of ten case studies that outline differing approaches to developing SIS in marine capture fisheries. These national, regional and non government case studies provide an opportunity to strategically assess and evaluate the use of SIS in fisheries management. The United Nations Conference on Environment and Development in 1992 addressed sustainable development as a means to satisfy the needs of human societies within the constraints presented by natural systems. Over the last ten years, sustainable development has been adopted by local, regional, national, and international institutions and instruments. Implementing and operationalising the concept of sustainable development has, however, provided significant challenges. Marine capture fisheries witnessed rapid development in the second half of the 20th Century. As pressure increases on capture fisheries, it is important that measures are introduced to ensure sustainable use of such fisheries. These measures include methodologies and frameworks for the assessment and management of fisheries incorporating biological, environmental, economic and socio-political relationships - the core of sustainable development. This thesis examines the viability of sustainability indicators as a tool for assessing progress towards sustainability. Indicator systems have been implemented across a range of fisheries jurisdictions with varying degrees of success. In assessing SIS in practice, several key components were distilled from the case studies and the assessment framework. The research demonstrates that SIS are used in national environmental reporting and fisheries specific systems across a range of legal and policy contexts, can link directly to the fisheries management process, and focus at the scale of fishery operations. Target species indicators are well advanced in SIS practice, ecosystem indicators are being rapidly developed and tested, and socio-economic and governance indicators require further progress. In terms of addressing sustainability outcomes, SIS are shown to facilitate scientific and policy coordination, increase transparency, accountability and co-management, increase the participation of environmental and non-government organisations, and provide the structure to implement ecosystem based management and precautionary approaches. While some SIS have been successful in developing measurement frameworks, criteria, objectives and indicators and adapting to specific policy contexts, further progress is required in developing reporting protocols, visualisation tools and aggregation methods.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">300700 Fisheries Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/234</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/234/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/234/2/02whole.pdf</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">On Location/s: Seeking fieldwork sites for the study of society and environment within teacher education - an analysis of social constructs of place and space</field><field name="creator">Johnston, RM</field><field name="description">As an ethnographic study situated within teacher education practice, this thesis is structured around 'three pedagogical moments' in the studies of society and environment units within a Bachelor of Education degree. This study links classroom teaching and observation illuminated through naturalistic enquiry with student surveys and interviews and locational analysis using a multi-method approach to research. The hidden and explicit curriculum and pedagogies of fieldwork are investigated as these are implemented in early childhood and primary education - and more particularly, in the teaching of Studies of Society and Environment (SOSE), as a specific site of knowledge construction in teacher education. Accordingly, the study is located within recent debates surrounding the nature of geographic knowledge and understandings of place and space as partial and socially constructed. It also draws on recent critiques of fieldwork in early childhood and primary education and more specifically, in geography. Integral to this discussion are understandings of place and space as triggers to childhood learning and emerging identity. Reference to paintings by Jeffrey Smart - as an illustrative and visual device -helps to locate the study's central themes, and the visual and emotional as well as rational and cultural dimensions of student teacher choices. Key themes identified through a constructivist approach to grounded theory are used as the basis of analysis of interview responses and the generation of theory. By beginning a critical pedagogy of space with the 'mattering maps' and 'cartographies of taste' of teacher education students, the study articulates the many discourses brought to the selection of sites for Studies of Society and Environment and contributes to the dialogic process of learning to teach.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">330300 Professional Development of Teachers</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/235</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/235/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/235/2/02whole.pdf</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Gene flow from introduced Eucalyptus plantations into native eucalypt species</field><field name="creator">Barbour, RC</field><field name="description">There has been a massive expansion of Eucalyptus plantations in Australia in the last decade. As most eucalypt species are native to Australia, this has raised concerns about genetic pollution of native species gene pools. To assess the risk of genetic pollution, five key aspects of gene flow from E. nitens plantations in Tasmania were studied. Firstly, the pattern of pollen dispersal from plantations into native E. ovata forests was examined at three sites. The frequency of F1 hybrids among 119 000 progeny, grown from open-pollinated seed collected from E. ovata trees at varying distances from E. nitens plantations, was determined. A leptokurtic pattern of pollen flow was evident, with the mean level of hybridisation at the plantation boundaries (0-100 m) being 14%, dropping to 1% by 200-300 m and continuing at this level to the extent of the studied areas (max. 1600 m). Secondly, the first exotic E. ovata x nitens F1 hybrids actually established in the wild were discovered and verified using morphological and allozyme analyses. Thirdly, field trials were established to assess the fitness of the exotic E. ovata x nitens F1 hybrids in the wild. The hybrids displayed poorer early-age performance relative to their pure E. ovata half-sibs. However, many were still alive and growing successfully two years after planting. Fourthly, surveys of flowering time were conducted on native Symphyomyrtus species, which were potentially at risk of gene flow from plantations. This was combined with a spatial analysis of the proximity of eucalypt plantations to each native species, and used to produce an overall assessment of the potential for exotic hybridisation and gene flow. These results indicated that at least eight of the 16 Symphyomyrtus species in Tasmania appear to have significant potential for pollination by E. nitens, and will need further study. Finally, the crossability of E. nitens pollen on native female Symphyomyrtus species was assessed using artificial pollination techniques. A number of species did not produce hybrids with E. nitens, indicating that post-mating barriers may be acting to prevent hybridisation. Overall results suggest that the main risk of genetic pollution in Tasmania is limited to a few species. Of those species, the ability of first and later generation hybrids to survive to reproductive maturity and backcross with native populations, allowing the introgression of exotic genes, is yet to be assessed.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">270400 Botany</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/237</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/237/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/237/2/02chapters1-4.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/237/3/03chapter5-6.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/237/4/04chapter7-end.pdf</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Science narratives : the construction, mobilisation and validation of Hydro Tasmania's case for Basslink.</field><field name="creator">Duncan, R</field><field name="description">The central focus of this thesis is the role of narratives in the construction, mobilisation and validation of scientific knowledge claims. With an epistemological commitment to constructivism, which conceptualises scientific knowledge as the product of a process (and not something revealed), the regulatory domain of impact assessment in respect of Basslink, a 350 kilometre power cable that will link Tasmania to the Australian mainland across Bass Strait, has been used as a case study to undertake the task of tracing the translations that intervened between assessment process inputs and outputs - contributions deemed 'scientific' and 'independent' by the project's proponents and supporters. Specifically, the knowledge claims tendered by Hydro Tasmania, Tasmania's hydro-electricity generator, in respect of predicted environmental impacts on the Gordon River arising from changes to river flows required to generate and export hydro-electricity across Basslink, have been examined. The central epistemological question has been how, given the extent of the contingencies and indeterminacies in predictive economic and environmental modelling inputs and outputs used to substantiate the impacts and benefits of Basslink (which have been detailed in the thesis), was Hydro Tasmania's case in support of the development made durable and, thereby, legitimated by the decision-making body charged with the task of assessing the project. This study follows Hydro Tasmania's knowledge claims in respect of the Gordon River impacts through the process and demonstrates the pivotal role of narratives and the extent to which they can bridge empirical gaps, explain and obscure inconsistencies, erase unexpected model outputs, contextualise findings and mobilise ontological claims. The tension between the fulfilment of disclosure requirements upon proponents by means of 'scientific facts'and the extent to which issues such as trust, accountability and past track record, bear upon people's uptake of these 'facts' is also examined in this work.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">300800 Environmental Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/238</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/238/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/238/2/02Intro-chapter4.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/238/3/03Chapter5-chapter8.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/238/4/04Chapter9-references.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/238/5/05Appendices.pdf</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Satellite altimeter calibration and validation using GPS buoy technology.</field><field name="creator">Watson, CS</field><field name="description">Satellite altimeters have become an important tool for the study of global and regional mean sea level change, offering near global coverage and unprecedented accuracy. Issues of calibration and validation remain central to their ability to determine estimates of change at accuracies of better than 0.5 mm/yr.This Thesis provides an absolute calibration of the TOPEX/Poseidon (T/P) and Jason-1 satellite altimeters, undertaken in Bass Strait, Australia. The research provides a contribution to the international calibration effort, with the Bass Strait site situated as the only one of its kind in the Southern Hemisphere.  A unique in situ absolute calibration methodology is presented, reliant on the episodic deployment of GPS equipped buoys at an offshore comparison point. In contrast to other calibration studies, data from the GPS buoys are used to solve for the absolute datum of an offshore oceanographic array (incorporating a pressure sensor, temperature and salinity recorders and a current meter array).  Combined with data from a coastal tide gauge and a regional GPS network, the methodology enables the cycle-by-cycle computation of absolute bias, without the necessity of estimating a marine geoid. Emphasis within this Thesis is given to the design and development of the GPS equipped buoys, in addition to the standardisation requirements of the geodetic analysis. The GPS buoy design is applied to both the altimeter calibration problem, in addition to a near shore application involving the calibration of tide gauges in the Antarctic and Sub-Antarctic.The attention to standardisation ensures comparable estimates of in situ and altimeter sea surface height. Differences at the 9 mm level for the pole tide displacement and plus or minus 5 mm for the solid Earth tide displacement are revealed when using the GAMIT GPS analysis suite.The implications of non-standardisation are further illustrated with the presentation of time series analysis from various continuous GPS datasets.  Absolute bias and 1-sigma uncertainties from a formal error budget are 0 plus or minus 14 mm for T/P and +152 plus or minus 13 mm for Jason-1 (for the GDR POE orbits, computed over the calibration phase, 18 Jan 2002  14 Aug 2002). Results over the duration of the T/P mission confirm a dependence on the choice of Sea State Bias (SSB), with the overall mean absolute bias not statistically different from zero. Extending the comparison period between Jason-1 cycles 1 to 101 (18 Jan 2002  06 Oct 2004) reduces the Jason-1 mean absolute bias by approximately 10 mm and reveals a significant slope of -7.6 plus or minus 5.6 mm per year.Whilst the cause for the significant absolute bias remains unexplained, the source of the drift appears attributable to the microwave radiometer, observed to be measuring drier over time (-5.9 plus or minus 2.1 mm/yr). Drift of the POE orbit relative to the JPL GPS orbit is shown to account for the remaining trend observed at the Bass Strait site.After considering geographically correlated errors, absolute bias results show excellent agreement with other international calibration studies.These results aid in understanding the performance of both the T/P and Jason-1 altimeters, further underscoring calibration and cross calibration of altimeters as essential for the study of low frequency oceanographic processes, including regional and global mean sea level change.The inference of geographically correlated orbit errors, and the significant unexplained Jason-1 absolute bias emphasises the need for maintaining globally distributed verification sites and makes it clear that further work is required to improve our understanding of the Jason-1 instrument and its algorithm behaviour.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">291002 Surveying</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/254</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/254/1/01Front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/254/2/02Whole.pdf</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">From Individuals to Populations: Personality traits in
 Southern Dumpling Squid (Euprymna tasmanica
 Pfeffer, 1884) and their life history correlates</field><field name="creator">Sinn, DL</field><field name="description">Several major reviews have recently highlighted the interest amongst life scientists in understanding the ecological and evolutionary significance of animal personality traits (e.g., Wilson 1998; Gosling 2001; Sih et al. 2004a). The term personality trait as it is used here simply refers to consistent individual differences in an animal's behavioural style (as opposed to its discrete acts), and therefore, represent a potential suite of behavioural traits that can describe behavioural individuality in animals. Using personality descriptors such as shyness-boldness, activity, etc., has the advantage in that we can describe holistic, aggregate behaviour of animals that may be important for selection between individuals. Understanding how animal personalities interact with life history strategies may help explain how individuals make-up populations, an important issue in evolutionary and population ecology. 
 
 While intuitively appealing, our knowledge of how intra-population individual differences in behaviour influence life histories is in its infancy (Wilson 1998). Cephalopods are well-known for their inter-individual variation in several key life history traits (e.g. growth and age-at-maturity), represent important commercial species in a number of worldwide fisheries, and also display complex individual behaviours (Sinn et al. 2001). Through a series of four experiments this project investigated personality traits in squid and their biological and ecological consequences.
 
 Four traits (shy-bold, activity, reactivity, and bury persistence) were identified across two ecologically important contexts in wild-caught adult squid. Trait expression was sex-independent, context-specific (i.e. bold squid in threat tests were not necessarily bold in feeding ones), and was related to body size and reproductive maturity. There was high individual variability in developmental processes associated with all traits, but some of this variation was partially explained by context, age, and developmental groups of squid. A quantitative genetic study was undertaken to describe the genetic structure of traits, in order to understand the potential for traits to respond to selection as well as provide a genotypic basis to understand potential fitness-related processes. In general, there were significant patterns of additive genetic variance for threat traits but not their feed counterparts, while age-related patterns of heritability indicated age-specific genetic expression for traits in both contexts. Reproductive experiments indicated no direct relationship between a female squid's personality and her short-term fitness, but an individual's levels of feeding boldness did have consequences for its subsequent success in mate pairings. Finally, a three year field study examined the frequencies of personality phenotypes across two populations in relation to density, body size, and sex ratios of squid within each population. Observations indicated differences between years and populations in mean change and patterns of frequencies of behavioural phenotypes, but these changes appeared to be independent of patterns in population body size and sex-ratio.
 
 This study is a first attempt to relate individualized behaviour to life history variables in a cephalopod mollusc, and the results should contribute to our knowledge of how individuals make up populations, a process that is of importance to a number of life sciences, including behavioural, population, fisheries and evolutionary ecology.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">300700 Fisheries Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/255</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/255/1/01Front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/255/2/02Whole.pdf</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Mathematical Model of a DC Machine</field><field name="creator">Chuang, N</field><field name="description">This research aims to determine how a mathematical model may predict the effects of a shorted and/or opened armature coil on a d-c machine.

The explosive growth in the number of documents published on the Web has made the web search engines the main means of initiating the interaction with the Internet. There are many good search engines, but users are often not satisfied with the results provided by the search engines. In many cases, the answers returned by the search engines are not relevant to the user information need, forcing the user to manually sift through the long list to locate the desired documents.  Often, when using a search engine the user needs to repeatedly refine their query as they do not have enough domain knowledge to formulate the query precisely. Although the average users know what kind of information they want, it becomes difficult for them to translate it to the search engine in an effective way so that the search engine understands the user needs. The specification of such a query is limited by the user's vocabulary and knowledge of the search domain. Even when disjunctions or conjunctions of keywords are chosen as the way of expressing the search goal, as existing search engines do, the user may not know what set of keywords they should use to define the collection of the desired documents precisely. Good query formulation requires that a user can somehow predict which terms appear in documents relevant to the information need. Accurate term prediction requires extensive knowledge about the document collection. Such knowledge may be hard to obtain, especially in large document collections.  In the field of information retrieval, it has been recognised that, although users had difficulty expressing exactly the information that they require, they could judge the retrieved documents as relevant or irrelevant based on their information need. This lead to the notion of Relevance feedback:  users marking documents as relevant to their needs and presenting this information to the information retrieval system. The system can use this information to retrieve more documents like the relevant ones by a process known as Query expansion.  This research explores the use of relevance feedback techniques to automatically discover related words to a query from the contents of the user-identified relevant documents. With these set of words it gives an algorithm to synthesise the user query in the form of a Boolean expression. The basic idea is that, a synthesised query providing a richer representation of the user's query would increase the number of relevant documents retrieved when used as a query to a search engine. The three objectives for the algorithm are to ensure that the synthesised query has good recall, good precision and not least, is of a form and size acceptable to the intended search engine. The query synthesis algorithm starts by imposing a task in the form of a first-cut search query to a search engine. The outcome from the search engine is displayed in terms of a set of documents.  Considering that the documents found on the Web being text documents, the user would attribute the documents as Relevant or Irrelevant based on their information needs. From these two sets of documents the algorithm creates a Boolean search query in the following five steps:  1.	The Boolean query construction begins with the construction of a CNF (Conjunctive Normal Form) Boolean expression of terms that selects every document in set Relevant and rejects every document in set Irrelevant. However the expressions so constructed are often too large to be acceptable to a search engine. 2.	The CNF expression is transformed into equivalent DNF (Disjunctive Normal Form) expression.  Redundant minterms are removed from further consideration and the set of non redundant minterms are referred as Mset.  3.	A Boolean expression Query is constructed by selecting minterms from Mset.The goal is to select a small set of minterms that selects each document in set Relevant. The constructed query is then written in a form suitable to the search engine.  4.	The process stops if the Query is acceptable to the search engine. Boolean expression Query becomes the required synthesised query. Otherwise, the Query needs modification in step 5.  5.	Minterms are modified to create a new minterm set Mset and the process repeats again from step3.  In this research, Google is used as the prime example of a search engine because of its popularity and cached link features on the Web. To confirm the success of the proposed query synthesis algorithm, a survey was organised with day to day users of a general purpose search engine like Google. To conduct the survey, a list of topics in diverse domains was chosen to collect data from the Web and a set of queries were generated by applying the proposed algorithm on these data sets. The participants were then asked to create queries for these host topics consistent with the information need. No constraint was placed on them regarding the time, number of tries or quality of their query. The target was to compare the quality of the human generated queries with the synthesised queries using evaluation measures known as precision, coverage and their combination called F1 measure. The traditional precision and coverage measurements collected during the survey show that the synthesised queries overwhelmingly perform better than the user queries. F1 measure is employed as the main evaluation metric as it combines both precision and recall into a single metric and favour a balanced performance of the two metrics. It resolves the anomalous situations, where a query with large coverage but low precision may not be considered as satisfactory as one with a modest coverage but high precision. The number of relevant documents among the first 10 and 20 retrieved links is used as a measure of the precision. Due to the difficulties of calculating recall, a new measure called coverage is used. The result shows that the synthesised queries can provide better values of F1 measure than the queries generated from a user's best effort. Higher values in F1 measure indicates the high values of precision and coverage obtained by the synthesised queries. Besides achieving the above goals, the proposed algorithm is able to synthesise queries in a form and size acceptable to the search engine. To verify whether the outcome of the survey is not resulted by chance a statistical procedure known as paired t-test is applied on the data obtained from the survey. The results of this test suggest that the synthesised queries provide better results when compared to human generated queries, which is statistically significant (P-value&lt;0.00001). The data obtained from the user survey has also been used to provide insights into the quality of human queries as function of its syntactical and other characteristics.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">280100 Information Systems</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/258</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/258/1/Sunanda_thesis_24_Jan_2006.pdf</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A High Froude Number Time Domain Strip Theory
 Applied to the Seakeeping of Semi-SWATHs</field><field name="creator">Holloway, DS</field><field name="description">In recent years there has been a rapid growth in the fast passenger ferry industry. Initially speed
 was the main selling point for designers, builders and operators, but as competition and choice
 have increased passengers are demanding better seakeeping performance. In addition designers
 and builders are starting to see the benefits of better seakeeping not only in terms of passenger
 comfort but in terms of structural strength and loading, allowing reduced structural weight and
 its many associated advantages. Two aspects of the seakeeping of fast ships are addressed in
 this thesis: response computation and the behaviour of semi-SWATH designs.
 
 Motion and load prediction for the practising naval architect has traditionally been done
 using strip theories, usually one closely related to the well known theory of Salvesen, Tuck
 and Faltinsen. This is a low Froude number theory, and although it is still being used, often
 successfully, for fast ships there is no rational justification for its validity in these cases. As
 speeds are increasing it is becoming imperative that an equivalent analysis tool suitable for
 higher Froude numbers be developed. This thesis proposes such a theory, based on calculation
 of two dimensional hydrodynamic potentials in a fixed  reference frame in place of the traditional
 moving one. This strip theory of necessity is a time domain theory, which also allows the possi-
 bility of introducing non-linearities, random sea input, and even slamming events (although only
 the first of these is discussed in any detail in the thesis). Validation has involved comparison
 with traditional theory and tank testing. Most notably pitch and coupling effects have shown
 improved predictions, but heave tends to be over predicted. The main candidates for explana-
 tion of this phenomenon are argued to be wake shedding, hull entry effects, steady-unsteady
 interactions and three-dimensionality.
 
 The majority of fast ferries being built at present have very conventional hull forms below
 the calm waterline. These have poorer seakeeping than their slower equivalents because their
 natural frequencies are encountered in longer waves, and traditionally designers have relied on
 lifting surfaces to counteract the increased motions. As these vessels get faster this approach
 will become less viable in terms of forces involved and appendage drag penalty. The type of hull
 form that will reduce motion accelerations without too much sacrifice of drag is not obvious,
 and a family of semi-SWATHs has been investigated as a possible alternative hull form. The
 investigation shows that as speed is increased the advantages of SWATH like forms become much
 greater if the criterion is to reduce accelerations.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">291200 Maritime Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/269</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/269/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/269/2/02whole.pdf</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Case Study of Policy and Practice in Occupational Health and Safety in South Australia</field><field name="creator">Dewar, G</field><field name="description">Work-place focused responsibility for both Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) management and the development of employee skills arising from new legislative and regulatory frameworks have imposed new responsibilities on managers and OHS practitioners in the work-place.

In both species, the rate of gonadal and larval development was proportional to water temperature, but the relationship was not simply multiplicative, rather there was a critical minimum water temperature below which development was arrested, known as the Biological Zero Point (BZP). The BZP for gonadal development was 7.8 degrees C for H. rubra and 6.9 degrees C for H. laevigata. Corresponding BZP values for larval development were 7.8 degrees C and 7.2 degrees C, respectively. Observations of larval development relative to temperature enabled a description of the Effective Accumulative Temperature (EAT; the cumulative difference between the culture temperature and the BZP, calculated hourly) for prominent developmental stages. The difference between the EAT for metamorphic competence and that for hatchout (i.e. the interval during which the larvae remain in the water column) was 1120 and 1160 EAT degrees C-h for blacklip and greenlip abalone, respectively. These values, in combination with water temperature data, enable the prediction of the dispersal window for each species in situ. Spawning performance of blacklip and greenlip abalone was also affected by temperature, with both sexes of each species producing significantly more gametes when conditioned at 16 degrees C than 18 degrees C. Sperm production of H. rubra was an order of magnitude greater than that of equivalent sized H. laevigata. There was no apparent difference in the lipid or fatty acid composition of the ovary or testis between pre- and post-spawning animals of either species, presumably because of partial spawning and/or incomplete resorption of the gonad. Likewise, a 4 degrees C difference in conditioning temperature (i.e. 14 degrees C vs 18 degrees C) was insufficient to elicit changes in tissue biochemistry. There was a significant interaction between sperm density and contact time on the fertilisation success of eggs from both blacklip and greenlip abalone. Prolonged exposure (&gt; 1200 s for H. rubra and &gt; 480 s for H. laevigata) to concentrated sperm (i.e. 107 ml-1) resulted in egg destruction. Analysis of CoVariance of F50 values (i.e. the sperm concentration required for 50% fertilisation, derived from the linear regression of logit (proportion of eggs fertilised) versus sperm density) between species across a range of contact times demonstrated that contact time had a significant effect (p &lt; 0.001) whereas species did not (p = 0.22). The lack of a species effect suggests that the fertilisation potential of blacklip and greenlip abalone eggs are similar, at least across the range of sperm densities and contact times used.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">300700 Fisheries Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/276</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/276/1/01Front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/276/2/02Whole.pdf</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The relationship between community newspapers and social capital: the power to empower</field><field name="creator">McManamey, R</field><field name="description">Research confirms the positive relationship between commercial newspaper readership and social capital. However, the relationship between independent community newspapers and social capital is largely overlooked in social science research. The purpose of this study is to explore the relationship between community newspapers and social capital by analysing the newspaper content, and investigating the timing of the establishment and production of independent community newspapers published in Tasmania between 1910 and 2000. Using both qualitative and quantitative approaches, and a mixed-method case study, the study explores the number and distribution of community newspapers in Tasmania, the issues presented, and the relationship between community newspapers and social capital. Data were gathered through a content analysis of the community newspapers, as well as semi-structured interviews with newspaper editors/coordinators. The content analysis framework incorporates four dimensions of social capital identified from the literature: elements, networks, knowledge and identity resources and incorgov. Content of a sample of 16 independent community newspapers was coded into Excel and was analysed using SPSS; results are presented as frequencies and cross-tabulations. Findings indicate that community newspaper numbers in Tasmania between 1970 and 2000 tripled. Community newspaper establishment was closely related to the periods of highest emigration and economic change throughout the century. This suggests that community newspapers contribute to higher community cohesion in 'difficult times'. The content analysis identified a changing focus of the papers's content from human interest and more global information in the earliest decades, to community and local issues and interests after 1950. The study supports the literature in finding that trust is a key factor linked to the establishment and increasing circulations of new publications. It is also a core element of social capital, functioning at a number of levels in the process and continuity of community newspapers. The process supporting the relationship between communities and their community newspapers is identified in this study for the first time as cyclical reciprocity. The study provides valuable insights into community dynamics and patterns of social capital. This has implications for community development practice and policy. The study classifies the broad term 'community newspaper' into three levels, allowing independent community newspapers 'of geographic locale' - established as a result of community initiative - to be identified as a unit, which may aid future media research. The study contributes a new perspective to social capital research by devising a content analysis framework to explore both the quality and quantity of social capital. Unlike other social capital research, the framework provides a means of analysing historical data and profiling social capital by means other than interview and survey. This has implications for expanding future social capital research.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">370100 Sociology</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/283</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/283/1/01Front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/283/2/02Main.pdf</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Small format digital aerial photography for mapping and monitoring seagrass habitats in shallow temperate marine waters</field><field name="creator">Mount, RE</field><field name="description">Seagrasses are core components of the nearshore environment and there is sustained interest in developing mapping and monitoring techniques of their extent and condition for management purposes. An identified gap in mapping methods is the capacity to monitor at landscape scales, that is, areas that are larger than the 1 m2 quadrat and smaller than those covered by broad area mapping (approximately 5km2 or greater). Monitoring at the landscape scale is required to investigate the dynamic patterning and patchiness present in seagrass beds, as well as providing inputs and validation for predictive modelling. However, the acquisition and use of remote sensing images for these purposes provides many challenges to the practitioner. The primary aim of this thesis is to develop effective optical remote sensing techniques for mapping and monitoring seagrass habitats in shallow temperate marine waters, over depth ranges of approximately 0-10 m and spatial scales of hundreds of square metres. Image capture is often compromised because of environmental conditions, such as sun glitter, water clarity, cloudiness and wind. Small format digital aerial photography was selected as the remote sensing platform for its flexibility and responsiveness regarding deployment when environmental conditions are favourable and its low cost, rapid access to imagery. To address the problem of sun glitter, a simplified algorithm was developed that allows the precise prediction of the extent of sun glitter on vertical, downward-looking imagery with the readily available inputs of sun elevation angle, wind speed and sensor field of view (FOV). Subsurface illumination was also investigated via the modelling of reflection and refraction at the water surface. These improvements and investigations enable more efficient and accurate image capture. Problems are also typically encountered during image interpretation, in part due to the characteristics of the seagrass habitats, including the common occurrence of uncertain boundaries and the high variability of vegetation density. Limitations on the detectability of the maximum depth limit (MDL) of seagrass were examined, with the discovery that if imagery is captured when water clarity is higher than the annual average, the limiting factor is the contrast between the seagrass and the surrounding substrate or submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV). A simple and inexpensive measurement of water clarity, Secchi depth (Zsd), was found to be suitable when applying this monitoring method. These findings have substantially increased the feasibility of monitoring seagrass condition and extent via the MDL, as well as the water quality parameter of average annual water clarity (Kz). A major challenge for image interpretation is presented by the high attenuation of light in water, which often means that spectral methods of image analysis, such as image classification, produce poor results. In response, an improved depth correction approach was developed that uses digital bathymetry (DEM) to assist in removing the spectral attenuation of light by the water column. The method lifted the accuracy of mapping seagrass epiphyte abundance (i.e. the amount of associated algae including epiphytic and drift algae present, related to biomass) by an average 25% to an overall average accuracy of 75%, though it made no difference to the accuracy of SAV density mapping (Note: SAV density relates to the proximity and length of the SAV blades such that high density SAV obscures the substrate and creates high levels of shadowing while lower densities have less shadowing and allow the substrate to be observed.). The improved depth correction method also enabled, for the first time from aerial photography, the production of a spatially explicit map of epiphytic biomass in the form of a continuous prediction surface with values ranging from 4 to 58 g dried weight m-2. In response to the shortcomings of the existing field observation measurements of seagrass density and cover for image interpretation purposes, a new measurement was created, called SAV structural density or SSD, which is designed to improve thematic coherence between aerial photography and field observations, such as downward-looking benthic videography or dive quadrats. This new measurement enabled the consistent discrimination of high and low density SAV with average overall accuracies of 77%, which supports the assessment of seagrass condition, particularly when complemented by the new maps of epiphyte abundance. This thesis presents methods that improve the quality of remote sensing of shallow marine habitats and provides a more reliable basis for further investigation of habitat change detection via spatial metrics and predictive modelling at landscape scales.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">291000 Geomatic Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/288</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/288/1/01_front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/288/2/02_ch1_to_ch4.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/288/3/03_ch5_to_ch6_refs.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/288/4/04_appendices.pdf</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Relationships between the Symptomatology and
 Neuropsychology of Schizophrenia: Three, Five,
 Eleven, or a Greater Number of Valid
 Syndromes?</field><field name="creator">Bruno, RB</field><field name="description">The marked heterogeneity between individuals diagnosed as experiencing schizophrenia has troubled nosologists since the very coining of the term. Catalysed by Crows (1980) hypothesis of independent positive, and negative syndromes, which led to substantial breakthroughs in our comprehension of schizophrenia, the last two decades have seen a resurgence of interest in the characterisation of symptom dimensions to resolve the issue of heterogeneity. A three dimensional model, comprising 'psychotic',  'negative', 'disorganised' syndromes has received considerable research attention and has been proposed for inclusion in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. Similarly, a five-dimensional model, adding syndromes of 'affective disturbance'and 'excitement', has also attracted an increasing profile of literature. Mounting evidence suggests, however, that these models do not adequately reflect the diversity of symptoms seen among those with a diagnosis of schizophrenia, and that they may emerge as an artefact of lossy factor-analytic techniques applied to measurement models biased or inadequate in their coverage of symptoms. To overcome such limitations, in the present study one hundred in- and out- patients diagnosed with schizophrenia were assessed for completed a battery of neuropsychological tests tapping five aspects of attention, and smooth pursuit eye tracking was also recorded. Using cluster analyses to examine correlations between symptoms, eleven groups of symptoms were identified: 'hostility', 'conceptual disorganisation', 'bizarre behaviour', 'grandiosity', 'auditory hallucinations', 'loss of boundary delusions', 'paranoia', 'anxious intropunitiveness', 'cognitive dysfunction', 'negative signs' and 'social dysfunctions'. All groupings were internally consistent, largely independent of others, and supported by other symptom models proposed in the literature. Several of the symptom groupings were validated by demonstration of independent relationships with neuropsychological variables or aspects of eye movements, and the more complex symptom model was equivalent or superior in the prediction of neuropsychological performance than the three- and five- factor symptom models.
 
 Implicit in dimensional approaches to conceptualising schizophrenia is the notion that the identified groupings may reflect the functioning of distinct brain systems. This thesis has demonstrated that the 'syndromes' defined by the three- and five- dimensional models of schizophrenia are actually heterogeneous groupings of poorly correlated symptoms. This, in turn, obscures the relationships between symptoms and underlying pathology. Dimensional approaches to psychopathology hold great promise for unravelling the nature of psychosis. However, the existing facile descriptions may actively constrain the potential for research progress. The rigorously developed description of symptomatology presented here represents a compact and useful representation of the spectrum of symptoms experienced in schizophrenia, and has demonstrated an advantage over existing conceptions that demands implementation and vigorous research attention.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">380103 Biological Psychology (Neuropsychology, Psychopharmacology, Physiological Psychology)</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/289</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/289/1/01Front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/289/2/02Part1.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/289/3/03Part2.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/289/4/04Part3.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/289/5/05Part4.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/289/6/06Part5.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/289/7/07Part6.pdf</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ion Chromatographic Determination of Haloacetates in Environmental Samples</field><field name="creator">Wang, F</field><field name="description">A method is reported for the sensitive, simultaneous determination of mono-, di-, and trifluoroacetates by ion chromatography. These species were separated using a Dionex AS17 anion-exchange column employed with a potassium hydroxide gradient (via a Dionex EG40 Eluent Generator) and suppressed conductivity detection. The fluoroacetates were successfully separated from a range of inorganic and organic species likely to be present in environmental samples, in a total analysis time of 35 min (including re-equilibration of the column). Detection limits for mono-, di- and trifluoroacetate were 21, 38 and 36 micrograms/L, respectively, determined using a signal to noise ratio of 3, and were obtained using a sample injection volume of 50 microlitres. Precision was less than 0.83% relative standard deviation for replicate injections performed over a period of 30 days. The method was applied to the determination of MFA, DFA and TFA in river water, carrot baits, urine samples and different kinds of plant material including Bilobum, Calvcinum and Spinosum, and found the concentration range of mono-(MFA), di-(DFA), tri-fluoroacetate (TFA) to be 11-788, 3.5-17 and 0.22-1.2 ppm in wet weight plant samples respectively. Further research was carried out using the Dionex equipment specified above. A comparative study was made of the chromatographic behaviour of nine haloacetic acids mono-(MFA), di-(DFA), tri-fluoroacetate (TFA); mono-(MCA), di-(DCA), trichloroacetate (TCA) and mono-(MBA), di-(DBA), tri-bromoacetate (TBA). The techniques included anion-exchange chromatography with suppressed conductivity and UV detection. All nine haloacetic acids were completely separated under the optimised gradient elution conditions. Using selective detection methods or by pretreating samples with a OnGuard II Ag cartridge, eliminated some interference. The procedure for the simultaneous determination of the nine haloacetic acids was simple and fast. The method detection limits for MFA, DFA, TFA, MCA, DCA, TCA, MBA, DBA, and TBA were 21, 40, 40, 48, 28, 86, 67, 55, and 160 ppb respectively, determined using a signal to noise ratio of 3. Applications of these methods for the determination of haloacetic acids in real soil samples are shown.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">250400 Analytical Chemistry</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/291</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/291/1/01Front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/291/2/02Whole.pdf</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">New Identity of the Kimberlite Melt: Constraints from Unaltered Diamondiferous Udachnaya-East Pipe Kimberlite, Siberia, Russia</field><field name="creator">Kamenetsky, MB</field><field name="description">This study aims at understanding parental melt compositions and evolutionary history of mantle-derived kimberlitic magmas, using unaltered Udachnaya-East kimberlite as an example. 
 Recent advances in theoretical, experimental and melt inclusion research strongly suggest that the mantle is highly heterogeneous on a small scale, but this heterogeneity is effectively obscured by the blended nature of most erupted magmas. Thus, the original compositions of individual mantle-derived melt batches that supposedly reflect their respective mantle sources are in fact averaged, owing to mixing of melts en route to the surface. The exception may be occasional low degree partial melts that erupt with little or no mixing with subsequent melt fractions. However, such melts are particulary prone to reaction with country rocks along the pathways to ascent, and are also very rare among erupted rocks. 
 Among all known erupted mantle-derived magmas, kimberlites offer the deepest probes into the convecting subcontinental mantle, derived from the lowest degrees of melting. Such origins make kimberlites most suitable for characterising primitive (undepleted by previous melting) mantle assemblages with their likely enrichment in the volatile elements, and thus with the lowest solidus temperatures. On the other hand, the large amount of lithospheric and crustal xenoliths in kimberlites and their typically high degree of alteration, can significantly affect interpretations that can be drawn from bulk rock analyses. 
 This study attempts to overcome such problems related to alteration of kimberlites and presents detailed petrographic, mineralogical, chemical, and isotope data on exceptionally fresh kimberlite samples from the diamondiferous Udachnaya-East pipe (Daldyn-Alakit region, Siberia). I demonstrate that the Udachnaya-East rocks have radiogenic isotopic compositions, petrographic features and major and trace element geochemistry typical of group-I kimberlites. However, unlike common kimberlites, the studied samples show no primary or secondary serpentine, and thus are essentially anhydrous (&lt; 0.5 wt% H2O), but CO2-rich (10-11 wt%). In contrast with other kimberlites worldwide, the Udachnaya-East samples are uniquely enriched in chlorine and alkalies (2.3-3.2 wt% Cl, 2.6-3.7 wt% Na, and 1.6-2.0 wt% K). 
 Enrichment in CO2, Cl and alkalies is expressed in the essentially alkali-carbonate (shortite, zemkorite) and alkali-chloride (halite, sylvite) composition of the kimberlite groundmass. These minerals cement olivine phenocrysts and form round segregations ("nodules"). Radiogenic isotope compositions (Nd, Sr, and Pb) of the chloride, chloride - alkali carbonate, carbonate and oxide-silicate constituents in the groundmass of the Udachnaya-East kimberlite effectively show the coexistence of these phases in the closed system since kimberlite emplacement ~ 347 Ma. Complementary to insights into radiogenic isotope composition of the parental mantle source of the Udachnaya-East kimberlite, my study explores stable isotope compositions of the kimberlite groundmass (O, C and S isotopes), chloride-carbonate nodules (O and C isotopes) and two populations of olivine (O isotopes). 
 Detailed study of zoning and composition of the groundmass olivine-II demonstrates very complex fractionation of the ultramafic primary kimberlite melt. Additional constraints are provided by olivine-hosted inclusions of cogenetic minerals, fluid and melt. The wide compositional interval shown by the cores of olivine-II (Fo86-93) reflects either crystallisation from different melt batches, or re-equilibration (in terms of Fe-Mg) with different mantle lithologies. I report the discovery of previously unknown inclusions of high-Ca pyroxene in the olivine-II cores. They formed in the diamond stability field (45-50 kb) at temperatures of 900-1100oC, from a melt with a trace element composition resembling that of the kimberlite groundmass. The inferred P-T conditions correspond to the lower part of lithosphere beneath the Siberian craton. 
 I consider that a prolonged evolution of the kimberlite magma by olivine crystallisation was responsible for a build-up of abundances of alkalies, chloride, carbonate, and sulphate components. As a result, the residual kimberlite magma acquires an essentially non-silicate composition, but high in CO2, Cl, and alkalies. This magma crystallises at low temperatures (&lt;650-750oC), and undergoes chloride-carbonate liquid immiscibility at ~600oC. 
 I propose that significant amounts of alkali chlorides and carbonates in the Udachnaya-East kimberlite are pristine magmatic components inherited from the kimberlite parental/primary magma. This enrichment may be responsible for the kimberlite low liquidus temperatures, low viscosities, and rapid ascent.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">260100 Geology</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/311</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/311/1/1_Maya_front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/311/3/2_Maya_chp-1-2.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/311/4/3_Maya_chp-3.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/311/5/4_Maya_chp-4-5.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/311/6/5_Maya_chp-6.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/311/7/6_Maya_chp-7.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/311/8/7_Maya_app.pdf</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Leaving the war zone - fifty (three) ways to leave your lover: A feminist analysis of fifty-three women's pathways to leaving a male partner who assaulted them</field><field name="creator">Patton, S</field><field name="description">This study explored how women were able to leave a male partner who assaulted them, and the common critical success factors of leaving and establishing a new life for themselves and any children in their care. Conducted from a feminist standpoint, a qualitative exploration of 53 women's perceptions of being able to leave was undertaken, using a non-probability purposive sampling method and semi-structured, in-depth interviews. Applying a thematic analysis, the results indicated that women used a variety of strategies to 'manage' and resist the abuse and violence, encountering numerous barriers to stopping the violence and/or to leaving, before reaching a final turning point. The pathways out of the violence included formal and informal support, supportive beliefs and information and underpinning structural supports, including relevant policies and laws. The study's findings highlight the importance of developing strategies that focus on men taking responsibility for their use of violence, effective government and community responses, and changing societal attitudes. The study provided examples of individual good practice in the responses of a range of workers, and identified a number of characteristics of good practice. Based on these characteristics, the study identified a generic framework for practice suggesting good practice at each of five identified phases of leaving. The study highlighted the importance of specialist domestic violence services and, in particular, mobile domestic violence crisis services, as an effective domestic violence service model. Integral to their effectiveness were: (a) their formal liaison with the police, through police Standing Orders; and (b) regional locations. Four key issues emerged requiring urgent attention: (1) women having to leave their homes; (2) the impoverishment of women who leave a violent partner; (3) the need for a consistent and integrated response across the service system; and (4) the importance of understanding both the role of hope and the concept of relational autonomy when responding to women who are assaulted by a male partner. The study discusses these findings in relation to contemporary social work practice.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">370100 Sociology</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/362</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/362/1/01Front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/362/2/02Whole.pdf</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Development of Strategies for the Management and
 Research of Foliar Pathogens on Eucalypt Plantations:
 Using Mycosphaerella as a Case Study</field><field name="creator">Smith, AH</field><field name="description">Foliar pathogens are capable of severely reducing the productivity and stem form of eucalypt trees in plantations. Mycosphaerella is one of the most severe defoliating pathogens to eucalypts worldwide. In Australia Mycosphaerella leaf disease (MLD) has produced episodes of severe defoliation in Tasmania, Gippsland and south-west Western Australia. Mycosphaerella is one of the most researched pathogens of eucalypts, however the majority of studies have concentrated on the taxonomy of pathogens and investigating their geographical and host ranges. In this thesis, MLD has been chosen as a model system to develop and apply new technologies to researching foliar pathogens. Research was conducted in the four main areas of disease assessment, growth impacts, molecular detection and resistance mechanisms.
 
 Acquiring accurate and repeatable damage estimates at a tree level is essential for calculating damage at plantation and estate levels; especially where data will be used for computer generated modelling using programs such as Maestra or CABALA. Repeated assessments using the Crown Damage Index (CDI) tested the suitability of the method to
 provide reliable, objective and repeatable results. Nine assessors, with varying levels of experience, estimated damage on three plots of fifty trees each (3-4 years old), to obtain an understanding of the subjectivity of assessing damage caused by insects (e.g. Chrysophtharta spp.) and fungal pathogens (e.g. Mycosphaerella spp.) on Eucalyptus
 globulus Labill. Damage levels were measured by destructive sampling to enable direct comparisons between estimates and damage levels to be made. The most experienced assessors provided the most repeatable estimates and were generally the most accurate. The incidence of foliar necrosis was the least subjective measure while defoliation was the most
 subjective and the least accurate of the indices measured. All assessors, regardless of experience, were able to predict the Crown Damage Index (a combined index of all damage classes) to within 12 % of measured damage levels. Further modification of the CDI in a separate study on younger trees (1-2 years old) further reduced the errors involved with damage estimates to within 4 % of actual damage levels.
 
 Despite the importance of Mycosphaerella species as significant defoliating pathogens of temperate plantation eucalypts such as E. globulus, there have been no studies to
 investigate the effects of Mycosphaerella damage on growth of young trees measured through to rotation length. From the results of two growth trials, one short term and one
 longer term (tree growth was monitored until 3 and 6 years old, respectively), the damage threshold (level of damage before there were significant growth effects) was estimated to be approximately 20 %. In both trials, losses in volume were only observed until trees changed to adult foliage at which point the growth rate returned to that of the control trees.
 We predicted that with less than 80 % damage, growth rates follow a type 1 growth response, i.e. after an initial growth loss damaged trees recover and have a growth rate that is parallel with control trees. Above 80 % loss of effective leaf area, it is predicted that growth rates of control trees and damaged trees are permanently divergent. To give a longterm estimate of impact, the growth of trees in the longer term trial were modelled to rotation length. After 25 years growth (rotation length) it is estimated that a loss of one year's growth will occur as a result of the MLD damage observed in this trial. One year was also the length of time that juvenile foliage was exposed to greater than 20% damage.
 A nested PCR detection method was applied to leaves and stems infected by MLD to detect the five most common Mycosphaerella species that occur in Tasmania. Leaf samples were taken from E. globulus and Eucalyptus nitens (Deane and Maid.) Maid. plantations in the northern regions of Tasmania and native re-growth in the north-east of Tasmania. For the first time it has been conclusively shown that in excess of five Mycosphaerella species can
 coexist in E. globulus leaves and four in E. nitens leaves, including a record of Mycosphaerella nubilosa (Cooke) Hansf. on E. nitens which has only been documented
 once before. Samples from native Eucalyptus regnans (Thum) Lindaure provided evidence that the co-existence of several Mycosphaerella species on a single lesion may occur outside the plantation environment. The molecular detection test was a rapid, reliable and cost-effective method in comparison with classical mycological methods for the
 identification and differentiation of species associated with MLD on eucalypts. These studies have highlighted the potential for multiple pathogenic species of Mycosphaerella to simultaneously occupy the same niche.
 
 The Mycosphaerella detection technique was also applied to determine the presence of species associated with MLD in leaf lesions of varying development, including asymptomatic tissue. Symptoms characteristic of putative Mycosphaerella lesions, collected from commercial E. globulus and E. nitens plantations, were categorised into five stages of development with asymptomatic tissue designated as the stage prior to any symptom expression. Lesions in all categories, including some asymptomatic leaf tissue,
 tested positive for the presence of up to four ycosphaerella species. The number and composition of species within a lesion varied between early and late stage lesions, with trends occurring for the most pathogenic species to occupy necrotic and reproductive lesions exclusively (E. nitens) or with only one other species (E. globulus). Early detection of Mycosphaerella species in asymptomatic leaves and at any stage of lesion maturity will
 facilitate more accurate, rapid and broad scale screening of plantations for ecological and epidemiological investigations at earlier stages of disease development. Effective and reproducible artificial inoculation techniques for MLD have not been developed; the
 confirmation of Mycosphaerella species in naturally infected early lesions using the nested PCR detection system enables the study of field infected leaves to determine the effects of infection on host physiology and resistance.
 
 The timing and strength of necrophylactic periderm formation, deposition of defence chemicals and accumulation/retention of photosynthetic pigments were compared between MLD susceptible E. globulus and the more MLD resistant E. nitens after infection of the
 leaves with Mycosphaerella species. Resistance of E. nitens, as observed in southern Australia, was attributed to the speed of necrophylactic periderm formation, which was
 directly related to the amount and type of cell division occurring in the mesophyll cells. In E. nitens the necrophylactic periderm is formed early in lesion development by cellular division of mesophyll cells which were quickly reinforced with lignin, suberin and other
 polyphenolics. It is suggested that the rapid nature of necrophylactic periderm formation in leaves of E. nitens was due to the presence of isobilateral palisade layers and the need for less cellular division to fill intracellular spaces and form a continuous barrier of cells. In E.
 globulus, which has only one adaxial palisade layer, the necrophylactic periderm was formed more slowly and in a distorted fashion. It was primarily formed through
 hypertrophic changes to existing cells and limited cell divisions. Deposits of lignin and suberin in the cells of the necrophylactic periderm did not occur in E. globulus until later  stages of lesion development, and in many cases the necrophylactic periderm appeared to be ineffective in preventing further disease development. From this study of necrophylactic periderm formation, it was suggested that increased mesophyll density within a leaf may be linked with the speed and shape of necrophylactic periderms that are formed after infection by Mycosphaerella species; thus the more resistant species/families are able to restrict pathogen spread more effectively than susceptible species/families.
 
 Under the same environmental conditions and inoculum load, northern NSW provenances of E. nitens have been observed to be more resistant to MLD than southern NSW provenances. Using histological methods, one provenance from each distribution were investigated with respect to constitutive anatomy. The cellular and histochemical changes after infection by Mycosphaerella species that led to barrier zone formation, including accumulation of defence compounds such as suberin, lignin and flavanoids were also compared. Leaves of resistant provenances were significantly thinner, had a higher proportion of palisade mesophyll and reduced intracellular airspace compared with those from the susceptible provenance. After infection, more cellular division was observed in sections from resistant leaves and the necrophylactic periderm formed was more organised,
 continuous, suberised and lignified than necrophylactic periderms formed in susceptible leaves. It is suggested that higher constitutive proportions of cell-dense palisade layers and thinner leaves can reduce the cellular division required to form of necrophylactic periderms after injury and compartmentalise pathogens more rapidly. More compact palisade layers may also play a role in the slowing or prevention of infection as some Mycosphaerella species may not be able to penetrate tightly packed mesophyll cells.
 
 Resistance of E. globulus juvenile foliage to MLD has been shown to be under high genetic control. Differences between pairs of resistant and susceptible families, in constitutive traits of juvenile leaves such as stomatal density (counted with wax on and with wax removed),
 leaf density, total phenolics and total leaf wax was assessed on juvenile leaves. Four resistant and susceptible pairs of families were compared including one inter-provenance, one intra-provenance and two within family contrasts. Resistant families had significantly
 higher leaf density in three of the four contrasts and had a higher density of palisade mesophyll cells. Resistant genotypes also had a higher proportion of stomata covered by
 wax. The density of exposed stomata (both abaxial and adaxial) may influence resistance to initial Mycosphaerella infection with wax coverage or deposition identified as the main trait governing the exposure of stomatal openings. This study suggests that leaf density may be associated with a higher cellular density within the leaf which would increase the potential for necrophylactic periderm formation and compartmentalisation of the infected
 area once infection has occurred. Future studies are required to determine the relationship between leaf density and cellular density.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">300600 Forestry Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/378</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/378/2/front_matter_Anna_Smith.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/378/3/Anna_Smith_Thesis..pdf</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Larval and Reproductive Biology of the Giant Crab Pseudocarcinus gigas</field><field name="creator">Gardner, C</field><field name="description">This thesis documents research on two aspects of the biology of the giant crab Pseudocarcinus gigas: the development, behaviour, and rearing of the larvae; and the reproductive biology of both sexes.  Larvae were reared from hatch to juvenile crabs.  The larval development of 5 zoeal and one megalopal stages were described which permitted identification of P. gigas larvae from plankton samples.  Samples from different depths were sorted to obtain information on vertical migration patterns, although few P. gigas larvae were collected.  Vertical migration was further investigated in experiments which analysed the swimming response to gravity, light intensity, change in light intensity, light wavelength, change in pressure, current, temperature, and thermoclines.  Response to temperature involved a feed-back mechanism that positioned larvae at temperatures optimal for growth, survival, and metamorphosis to megalopa (14-16C).  Light intensity and photoperiod had little effect on survival although larvae reached megalopa most rapidly with long photoperiod and high intensity and were smaller in continuous darkness treatments.  Cannibalism of stage 1 and 2 zoeas was highest with long photoperiod and low intensity.  Mycosis and epibiotic fouling of larvae necessitated trials with prophylactic treatments.  Survival was highest with a broad spectrum antibiotic (oxytetracyline) while promising results were obtained with carbendazim and copper oxychloride.  Suitable concentrations for indefinite baths were established by monitoring toxic effects as increased mortality, deformity, prolonged intermoult, or death during moulting. The male reproductive tract is typical of brachyurans with ovoid, enveloped, spermatophores stored in the mid vas deferens (MVD).  Males pass through three morphological stages (of chela development) and individuals from all three stages had spermatophores in the MVD.  Mating pairs were never observed but patterns of limb loss indicate that mating involves female-centred competition.  Females appear to mate while soft-shelled with stored sperm remaining viable for at least four years.  Broods are produced annually although females occasionally skip a reproductive season, which may be associated with moulting.  Several broods may be produced between moults although fecundity declines with successive broods.  The hepatopancreas underwent little change in composition during gonadogenesis.  Fecundity increased with female size, although not in a simple cubic (volumetric) relationship as larger females produced larger eggs.  This increase in egg size was associated with a significant, albeit small, decrease in protein and carotenoid, and an increase in moisture, while lipid appeared unaffected.  Protein was used preferentially to lipid during embryogenesis.  Techniques for immobilising, humanely killing, and internal imaging of crabs were employed for research on reproduction and are described.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">300700 Fisheries Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/380</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/380/1/Part_2.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/380/2/Part_1.pdf</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Affective outcomes for students and hosts participating in school-sponsored workplace learning</field><field name="creator">Welch, A</field><field name="description">In response to growing systemic awareness of the need to prepare school students for workplace participation, school-sponsored workplace learning was established as part of the secondary school curriculum in most Western democracies by the 1980s. By the 1990s contracting youth labour markets and qualitative changes in acceptable workforce credentials accompanying economic globalisation, technological change and industry restructuring had highlighted the role of school-sponsored workplace learning in school-based vocational education and training programs. Concurrently, complementary interest has emerged about school-sponsored workplace learnings' influence on school students' affective development, particularly about its potential to motivate students from socio-economically disadvantaged backgrounds to maintain and extend their education and/or training beyond the compulsory school leaving age. Despite anecdotal evidence supporting claims for positive affective outcomes for students participating in school-sponsored workplace learning, relatively little empirical research has been undertaken to provide substantive evidence supporting those claims. One facet of this study seeks to address this shortfall. Using a pretest-posttest survey form of the non-equivalent control group design, the study's matched pairs analysis describes positive treatment effects for both genders in motivation for school learning at the first three levels of the Affective Domain Taxonomy (Krathwohl, Bloom, &amp; Masia, 1964). Moreover, these positive treatment effects were of sufficient statistical significance and power to accept the hypothesis that socio-economically disadvantaged female high school students will report improved motivation for school learning at Level 3 (Valuing) of the Taxonomy following participation in workplace learning. In so doing, this aspect of the study contributes to closing the descriptive - correlational - experimental research loop for this field of enquiry (Rosenshine &amp; Furst, 1973).  Correspondingly, little is known of the affectivity attending workplace mentoring roles for school-sponsored workplace learning. In the second facet of this study affectivity attending host workplace mentoring roles is described by adapted forms of organizational spontaneity (George &amp; Brief, 1992) that are structured on multiple levels of analysis (Cote,1999) based on workplace context layers (O'Connor, 1994b). Data collection of evidence for workplace mentors' affectivity adopted a positivist approach and, through combined quantitative and qualitative analyses, showed that positive affect in the workplace was attended by mentoring activities such as helping co-workers, developing oneself, and spreading goodwill.

These findings add to the embryonic literature concerning host workplace mentors' affective responses to hosting school students for workplace learning.

An annotated type based analysis is introduced which ensures that no contamination will occur between data considered trustworthy and data that may have been corrupted. A method of performing safe run-time coercion of security properties of data is also presented. This is novel because it enables users to perform run-time coercions of data in a manner that may be statically proven safe. Both plain networks and dynamic (agent-based) networks are considered.  These are modelled as systems of first-order and higher-order pi-calculus, respectively. The higher-order system examined introduces a new notion of trustworthiness dependent on the context in which it is typed or executed.  This allows programs with malicious intent to be safely executed when it can be demonstrated that no possibility for interaction with other programs, including the host, is possible. A concept of execution context is introduced to perform this analysis.  In addition, annotated type systems with and without sub-typing are described, and sub ject reduction is shown to hold for all systems considered.  Implementation of the method is demonstrated via type-inference algorithms, and these are shown to be both sound and complete for all systems.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">280100 Information Systems</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/390</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/390/1/thesis.pdf</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Trematode Fauna of a Brackish Coastal Lagoon in Tasmania</field><field name="creator">Smith, SJ</field><field name="description">Calvert's Lagoon, a land-locked, brackish lagoon on the south-east coast of Tasmania, Australia, serves as a focus for the life-cycles of a wide variety of digenetic trematodes. A gastropod, Coxiella badgerensis (Johnston), is the only molluscai inhabitant, and it is heavily infected by trematodes throughout the year. The incidence of primary trematode infections was found to vary seasonally, with a peak in autumn. Developmental stages of 17 species from 7 trematode families were recorded in snails collected at the lagoon from April 1976 to September 1978. In order of abundance'of primary infections, the families were: Microphallidae (3spp.), Schistosomatidae (lsp.), Notocotylidae (4spp. 1, Renicolidae (2spp.) Psilostomidae (3spp.) , Heterophyidae (3spp.) and Strigeidae (lsp.). Gravid adults of 9 of these species were found infecting a wide range of birds at the lagoon, including swans, ducks, grebes, dotterels and coots. Two of the flukes, Apatemon gracilis (Rudolphi) and Psilochasmus oxyurus (Creplin) are cosmopolitan; however the geographical distributions of the others are unknown.   About 80% of primary trematode infections at the lagoon were caused by the 3 microphallid species: Maritrema calvertensis Smith, Levinseniella tasmaniae (Smith) and Atriophallophorus coxiellae Smith. M. calvertensis and L. tasmaniae have typical 3 host life-cycles, however, A. coxiellae is one of 10 known microphallids that exhibit a reduced life-cycle, with metacercarial cysts being formed in the molluscan host. The daughter sporocysts and xiphidiocercariae of M. calvertensis and L. tasmaniae are distinguished by several morphological characteristics. The behaviour and ecology of the cercariae were also found to differ in ' many respects. There is a distinct periodicity in the patterns of emergence of both cercariae from their snail host, however the cercaria of L. tasmaniae emerges during the day, wiiereas that of M. calvertensis emerges at night. Although both species encyst in the amphipod Austrochiltonia australis gayce)only M. calvertensis is infective to the ostracod, Mytilocypris tasmanica McKenzie. Metacercarial cysts of L. tasmaniae induce a colour change, from green to bright orange, in the amphipod host. The hoary-headed grebe, the most abundant bird at Calvert's Lagoon, harbours the minute adults of each of the microphallids: L. tasmaniae inhabits the intestinal caeca and Maritrema calvertensis and Atriophallophorus coxiellae have overlapping, but different distributions in the lower small intestine. The life-cycles of the three microphallids, the psilostomes Psilochasmus oxyurus and Psilostomum spp.A and B, and the notocotylids Paramonostomum bursae n.sp. and P. caecai n.sp., were demonstrated experimentally. Growth and development in laboratory ducklings were studied. At Calvert's Lagoon, gravid adults of dpatemon gracilis were found in a black duck, and intramolluscan stages were found in C. badqerensis, however no second intermediate host was found. Metacercarial cysts of A. qracilis were found infecting the freshwater Q native fish, Galaxias auratus Johnston, at Lake Crescent, about 100 km NW of Calvert's Lagoon, (life-history notes on A. qracilis and another strigeoid, Diplostomum qalaxiae n.sp., infecting G. auratus at Lake Crescent, are presented in Appendix 2). A comparison was made of the in vitro development of metacercariae of the 3 microphallids developing in C. badgerensis atcalvert's Lagoon, and 4 microphallids, Gynaecotyla hickmani n.sp., G. macrocotylata n.sp., Maritrema eroliae Yamaguti and Microphallus paraqrapsi n.sp., that encyst in an estuarine crab, Paragrapsus gaimardii (M. Edw.), at Bruny Island, about 20 km SW of Calvert's Lagoon (descriptions of the microphallids infecting P. qaimardii are presented in Appendix 3). All of the microphallids produced eggs in vitro; however, the rates of egg production in different culture media varied between species. A direct relationship is suggested between the longevity of each species in its definitive host and its nutritional requirements in vitro, such that very short-lived flukes, like L. tasmaniae, relying on endogenous food reserves, can produce eggs at normal rates in balanced salt solution, whereas relatively long-lived flukes require more complex culture media for normal development.    Preliminary investigations of the ecology of other water bodies in Tasmania revealed that the trematodes found at Calvert's Lagoon are widely distributed on the E and NE coasts of Tasmania in enclosed, brackish lagoons inhabited by C. badgerensis. The distributions of these trematodes probably extend to similar water bodies that occur on the Bass Strait Islands and in the SE of the Australian mainland.</field><field name="date">1981</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">270500 Zoology</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/402</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/402/1/01Front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/402/2/02Whole.pdf</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A GIS Study of Australia's Marine Benthic Habitats</field><field name="creator">Beaman, R</field><field name="description">Continental shelf waters are subject to the greatest impact by humans. If marine ecosystems are to be efficiently managed and protected from the adverse effects of human activities, then identification of the types of marine habitats and the communities they contain is required. Research cruise data and existing data were collected at three diverse study sites on polar, temperate and tropical continental shelves within Australia's Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). This project conducted a multi-disciplinary analysis of satellite imagery, multibeam sonar, seismic profiles, oceanographic data, underwater video, and the results of sediment sampling. A Geographic Information System (GIS) was utilised to model the spatial boundaries of the physical and biological datasets. Spatial and multivariate statistical analyses were conducted on the GIS models and datasets to explore the relationships between abiotic and biotic patterns. GIS was used to map the spatial distribution of benthic habitats at each study site within a hierarchical context. The East Antarctic continental shelf has had few studies examining the macrobenthos structure or relating biological communities to the abiotic environment. On the George V Shelf, GIS was used to map the geomorphology, surficial sediment and near-seabed water mass boundaries. A study of underwater photographs and the results of biological sampling provided information to infer the dominant trophic structure of benthic communities within geomorphic features. A hierarchical method of benthic habitat mapping was applied to the Geomorphic Unit and Biotope levels at the local (10s of km) scale. The study revealed that mud content, iceberg scour, and oceanic currents are the likely dominant abiotic factors in the broad-scale distribution of macrofauna on the George V Shelf. To better understand the relationships between the geology of the seabed and associated biological communities, a multibeam sonar survey was conducted over New Zealand Star Bank, eastern Bass Strait, Australia. Through spatial and multivariate analyses of surficial sediment composition and underwater video, the biological assemblage patterns were related to the variation in geomorphology and substrate. A hierarchical method of benthic habitat mapping was applied to the Secondary Biotope and Biological Facies levels at the site (&lt;10 km) scale. The major differences which control the distribution of biological communities in the New Zealand Star Bank area appear to be related to variations in substrate.  To help answer the question whether geophysical data from habitats can be used to predict the occurrence of benthic biodiversity, a multibeam sonar survey was conducted in the northern Great Barrier Reef - Gulf of Papua region. Multivariate statistical analyses were applied to the biological and physical datasets to determine patterns in the distribution of megabenthos, and the relationship with abiotic variables. A hierarchical method of benthic habitat mapping was applied to the Secondary Biotope and Biological Facies levels at the site (&lt;10 km) scale. The combination of substrate type, sedimentary dynamics and physical processes related to nearseabed currents appear to be a dominant control on the benthic communities in the northern Great Barrier Reef - Gulf of Papua region. Benthic habitat mapping plays a vital part in understanding marine ecosystems and the processes which influence the spatial distribution of benthos. The results of this research have made significant in-roads in the development of a framework for ecosystem-based management of the study areas, the contribution to the ongoing bioregionalisation of Australia, and through an examination of the use of geophysical proxies for the occurrence of biological assemblages, which are fundamental to the establishment of Marine Protected Areas.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">291002 Surveying</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/419</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/419/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/419/2/02chapter1.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/419/3/03chapter2.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/419/4/04chapter3.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/419/5/05chapter4.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/419/6/06chapter5.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/419/7/07appendix.pdf</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Intercultural Literacy and the International School</field><field name="creator">Heyward, M</field><field name="description">In this study a new developmental model describing the nature of intercultural literacy and how it is learnt is proposed and trialled. Intercultural literacy is defined as the understandings, attitudes, competencies and identities which enable effective participation in a cross-cultural setting. As such it is presented as a crucial literacy for the globalised world of the twenty-first century. The Multidimensional Model for the Development of Intercultural Literacy is developed on the basis of theory from social psychology and international education, is checked for validity against reference groups in the field - practitioners in international schools in Indonesia, Singapore and Thailand - and is modified in the light of inputs received. The model is then trialled in the context of a case study of the Tanjung Bara International School and its community in East Kalimantan, Indonesia. The case study seeks to map the school and community in terms of intercultural literacy, evaluate the school's intercultural literacy curriculum and explore the relationship between the community and school in relation to intercultural literacy learning. The broad aim is to determine the extent to which the proposed model is useful in helping to describe the case and to answer the questions posed by the case study. The case study concludes that the school and its community is predominately at a monocultural or 'distancing' level with a smaller group moving into the more positive learning stage characteristic of the cross-cultural level in the model. The community is found to have been deeply divided on cultural lines between the Indonesian and the largely Australian expatriate communities. The international school contributed to this divide through reinforcing the status of expatriates as privileged and separate. The objectives of the curriculum and non-core school programs to facilitate intercultural literacy were found to have been seriously hampered by this cultural divide, among other factors. The school was not found to have played a significant role in facilitating intercultural literacy learning in the broader community. The thesis concludes that the proposed Multidimensional Model for the Development of Intercultural Literacy is useful in this case study and is potentially useful in a wide range of contexts, particularly in international schools and their communities. It provides a tool which may assist educators in understanding intercultural literacy and facilitate the development of policy and practice including curriculum, extra-curricular programs and assessment.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">330100 Education Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/423</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/423/1/01FrontMatter.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/423/2/02Whole.pdf.pdf</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluation of Dorycnium spp. as Alternative Forage Plants</field><field name="creator">Davies, SR</field><field name="description">The genus Dorycnium L. consists of a number of species of perennial leguminous shrubs known to be relatively drought tolerant. Low rainfall areas (i.e &lt;600 mm annually) of Australia under agricultural use are subject to periods of feed shortage during summer and autumn, and hence animal production is limited at this time. Dorycnium spp. have been identified as having the potential to be integrated into Australian grazing systems as a source of forage when little or no other feed is available. This project was established to further investigate a number of key issues related to the agronomic and forage characteristics of this potentially important genus. Research was undertaken into Dorycnium spp. to examine three important factors associated with the evaluation of a legume, seed germination characteristics, the nutritional value of the forage, and rhizobial associations.  Dorycnium hirsutum Ser. accessions TAS1002 and TAS2001 were subjected to a range of germination experiments examining the level of pod maturity, harvest season, and the effect of pre-germination treatments. The seed coat of D. hirsutum was found to influence germination behaviour, with the use of pre-germination scarification treatments improving germination behaviour by increasing the percentage germination (PG) and lowering the mean time to complete germination (MTG) and percentage hard seed. Mechanical scarification of TAS2001 for 20 seconds was found to increase (P&lt;0.05) PG from 86 to 96 %, lower the MTG from 6.0 to 2.7 days, and reduce the percentage hard from 13.6 to 1.9 % in relation to untreated seed. Mechanical and chemical scarification techniques were found to be the most effective in promoting rapid and uniform germination, were simple to apply and were repeatable. In general, inherent differences in seed lot germination characteristics were believed to be associated with the influence of environmental factors and the natural characteristics of selected accessions with indeterminate flowering.  Established plots of D. rectum Ser., D. hirsutum and D. pentaphyllum Scop. were sampled along with an area of lucerne (Medicago sativa L.) on a regular basis throughout the spring/summer period of 2001/2002. Samples were analysed using near infrared reflectance spectroscopy (NIRS) and wet chemistry for crude protein (CP), neutral detergent fibre (NDF) and dry matter digestibility (DMD) and metabolisable energy (ME). Over the course of the sampling period forage of Dorycnium spp. generally displayed decreases in CP, ME, DMD and increases in NDF. Typical CP values ranged from 4 - 18 % of dry matter (DM), NDF 21 - 72 % of DM, DMD 32 - 75 %, and ME 4.1 - 11.0 MJ/Kg/DM. The nutritive value of Dorycnium spp. forage appeared to be influenced by environmental and developmental characteristics, with the growth stage identified as a useful tool for predicting forage quality. Although Dorycnium plants were of lower forage value than lucerne, their forage can provide livestock with an important source of nutrition in areas of low rainfall and during periods where there are feed gaps.  Experimental plots of Dorycnium spp. at three Tasmanian sites were sampled every six weeks throughout the spring/summer period of 2002/2003 and analysed using a modified butanol-HCl method for condensed tannins (CT). The CT content of D. hirsutum was found to fluctuate from 3.2 to 16.6 % of the DM. Dorycnium rectum and D. pentaphyllum were found to contain CT levels of at least 7.7 and 6.8 % of DM respectively during the sampling period. The CT levels observed were considered to be high in general, with only D. hirsutum containing levels that may be considered to be low and possibly beneficial at certain stages of development. Increases in CT levels were associated with the initiation of flowering, and interactions between the environment and species were observed, although no common factor was identified as influencing CT levels.  A glasshouse experiment was undertaken to assess the nitrogen fixing ability of the commercial Lotus corniculatus L. inoculant SU343 with Dorycnium spp. against a range of alternative inoculants. The host/rhizobia interactions of Dorycnium spp. along with six important pasture legumes and a range of inoculants was assessed. Strains WSM1284, WSM2323 and WSM2338, along with SU343 were found to be suitable inoculants for Dorycnium spp. examined. However, negative interactions between these inoculants and important pasture legumes were identified. Inoculant strains, WSM1284, WSM2323, WSM2338 and SU343 were selected to undergo evaluation under Tasmanian field conditions with D. hirsutum and D. rectum. In the field all strains were found to fix adequate amounts of atmospheric nitrogen. Inoculant SU343 was confirmed to be a suitable inoculant for D. rectum in terms of performance and commercial viability, however, WSM2338 and WSM1284 were found to be equally suitable. The inoculation of Dorycnium hirsutum with the Tasmanian isolate WSM2323, was found to be a significantly (P&lt;0.05) superior strain to SU343 in terms of nitrogen fixation. The inoculation of D. hirsutum did not affect (P&gt;0.05) plant DM production in the field. The ability of the inoculants to compete with a background population of root nodule bacteria was found to be of concern, and may have serious implications for the long-term performance from a single inoculation event. It was proposed that a combination of rhizobial strains may be more effective as a commercial inoculant rather than relying on the single L. corniculatus inoculant SU343.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">300200 Crop and Pasture Production</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/451</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/451/1/01_Front_Matter.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/451/2/02_Whole_Thesis.pdf</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A mixed-mode GPS network processing approach for volcano deformation monitoring</field><field name="creator">Janssen, V</field><field name="description">Ground deformation due to volcanic magma intrusion is recognised as an important precursor of eruptive activity at a volcano. The Global Positioning System (GPS) is ideally suited for this application by being able to measure three-dimensional coordinate changes of the monitoring points over time. Due to the highly disturbed ionosphere in equatorial regions, particularly during times of maximum solar activity, a deformation monitoring network consisting entirely of single-frequency GPS receivers cannot deliver baseline solutions at the desired accuracy level. In this thesis, a mixed-mode GPS network approach is proposed in order to optimise the existing continuous single-frequency deformation monitoring system on the Papandayan volcano in West Java, Indonesia. A sparse network of dual-frequency GPS receivers surrounding the deformation zone is used to generate empirical 'correction terms' in order to model the regional ionosphere. These corrections are then applied to the single-frequency data of the inner network to improve the accuracy of the results by modelling the residual atmospheric biases that would otherwise be neglected. This thesis reviews the characteristics of existing continuously operating GPS deformation monitoring networks. The UNSW-designed mixed-mode GPS-based volcano deformation monitoring system and the adopted data processing strategy are described, and details of the system's deployment in an inhospitable volcanic environment are given. A method to optimise the number of observations for deformation monitoring networks where the deforming body itself blocks out part of the sky, and thereby significantly reduces the number of GPS satellites being tracked, is presented. The ionosphere and its effects on GPS signals, with special consideration for the situation in equatorial regions, are characterised. The nature of the empirically-derived 'correction terms' is investigated by using several data sets collected over different baseline lengths, at various geographical locations, and under different ionospheric conditions. Data from a range of GPS networks of various sizes, located at different geomagnetic latitudes, including data collected on Gunung Papandayan, were processed to test the feasibility of the proposed mixed-mode deformation monitoring network approach. It was found that GPS baseline results can be improved by up to 50% in the mid-latitude region when the 'correction terms' are applied, although the performance of the system degrades in close proximity to the geomagnetic equator during a solar maximum.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">291000 Geomatic Engineering</field><field name="subject">260103 Vulcanology</field><field name="subject">291001 Geodesy</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/510</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/510/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/510/2/02chapter1.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/510/3/03chapter2.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/510/4/04chapter3.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/510/5/05chapter4.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/510/6/06chapter5.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/510/7/07chapter6.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/510/8/08references.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/510/9/09appendices.pdf</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The assertion of Tasmanian Aboriginality
 From the 1967 Referendum to Mabo</field><field name="creator">Daniels, DW</field><field name="description">This paper takes as its starting point a period before the 1967 Referendum
 which gave full citizenship rights to Australian Aborigines and the Federal
 Government a mandate over Aboriginal Affairs. During the 40's and 50's the
 Aboriginal people of Tasmania, represented by the people of Cape Barren
 Island, stubbornly resisted the assimilation policies of the day. In briefly
 examining the thesis of resistance as proposed by Lyndall Ryan in her 1981
 edition of The Aboriginal Tasmanians, and the proposition that the Government
 sought to abandon the Island, the paper draws upon new material.
 Despite the referendum the State government like the wider community saw
 little relevance to Tasmania, denying the existence of Aborigines as such, but
 joining in the CommonwealWState Conferences of Aboriginal Affairs to
 safeguard State interests, obtain funds to prop up services to the Island,
 particularly health, and to secure housing finance.
 Support for the Aboriginal cause, however, was not lacking. The Aboriginal
 Advancement League based in Devonport, the Communist Party of Tasmania
 and Abschol, which was to become the Australian Union of Students action
 group for Aboriginal rights, were to play a role in sensitising the Tasmanian
 community to Aboriginal issues and in seeking justice for Tasmanian
 Aborigines. It was Abschol, however, which was to become the dominant non-
 Aboriginal organisation in the pursuit of Aboriginal rights.
 In the early '70's the Tasmanian Aboriginal people decided to take over their
 own destiny. This assertion was led by Rosalynd Langford, a Victorian
 Aborigine of Tasmanian descent. In 1972 the Aboriginal Information Centre
 (later the Tasmanian Aboriginal Centre) was established. This paper looks at
 the history of TAC over the next 20 years. It was to become one of the most
 forceful and successful black political organisations in Australia and we
 examine the reason for that success. Whilst the figure of Michael, Mansell
 emerges on the local, national and eventually the international scene, the record
 would not be complete if it neglected reference to other contributors to the
 struggle.
 Neither would the story be complete without reference to the genealogical work
 of Mollison et al, the whole question of Aboriginality, the reworking of
 Aboriginal history from the people's perspective, cultural renewal and
 Aboriginal spirituality. Central to this issue of history and identity is the world
 wide quest for the skeletal remains of the Van Diemen's Land people and theirreturn to Tasmania, which the paper identifies as a brilliant strategy of
 unification and consciousness raising, but one full of emotional and spiritual
 overtones.
 This paper concludes with an examination .of the struggle for Land Rights in
 Tasmania. At this point in time some form of Land Rights legislation seems
 inevitable, although as the story tells, Aboriginal people have had their previous
 hopes dashed on a number of occasions.* There is, however, a further matter
 on the Aboriginal agenda; self govenunent. To underestimate these later
 aspirations is to fail to recognise the power and commitment of the Tasmanian
 Aboriginal people.

The wealth and complexity of its natural attributes form the basis of a rich and complementary human history. However, management of the region is focused on the conservation of natural attributes, sometimes at the cost of human interests and cultural values. This is symptomatic of the way in which many heritage properties are managed and is a source of problems in the identification and interpretation of heritage. There is a need to better understand the human dimensions of such 'natural wonders' to ensure effective management. In order to address some of these issues, this thesis explores visitor experiences and knowledge of the Great Barrier Reef with a particular focus on the non-local experiences and knowledge that underpin the region's global recognition. One of the major issues for management is the mutable nature of heritage values. This research therefore seeks to develop an understanding of how such heritage values are formed, transformed and sustained over time. It takes an historical approach to understand the ways in which visitor knowledge of the Reef has been constructed and transmitted both temporally and spatially. Methods novel to heritage assessments are developed and implemented to identify and contrast visitor experiences in the past and those of the present. The study focuses on visitor sensory experiences of the Reef as a means to understand knowledge of place. A concept of sensuousness is defined and used to understand how knowledge of place is constructed through the human senses, and communicated within and between generations. The research identifies a number of significant changes in the way in which visitors have constructed and understood the Great Barrier Reef. These include the creation of idealised Pacific islands at the expense of an Australian location and character; the transformation of the dangerous underwater world into a controlled and benign coral garden; and the synecdoche of the coral garden as representative of the Reef as a whole. Central to these constructions is the way in which simulacra are used to create experiences that are increasingly both dislocated and disembodied. As a consequence visitor knowledge of the Reef has shifted from sensuous perception of the Reef as a place or series of places, to the construction of imaginative and photographic simulacra that manifest as experiences of space and non-place. Through the exploration of this case study, the thesis makes a contribution to both theoretical and methodological issues in heritage studies.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">370302 Social and Cultural Anthropology</field><field name="subject">430101 History - Australian</field><field name="subject">310102 Heritage and Conservation</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/629</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/629/2/Pocock_Front_Matter.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/629/3/Pocock_CH-1.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/629/4/Pocock_CH-2.pdf</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Genesis: An Extensible Java</field><field name="creator">Lewis, IJ</field><field name="description">Extensible programming languages allow users to create fundamentally new syntax and translate this syntax into language primitives. The concept of compile-time meta-programming has been around for decades, but systems that provide such abilities generally disallow the creation of new syntactic forms, or have heavy restrictions on how, or where, this may be done.  Genesis is an extension to Java that supports compile-time meta-programming by allowing users to create their own arbitrary syntax. This is achieved through macros that operate on a mix of both concrete and abstract syntax, and produce abstract syntax. Genesis attempts to provide a minimal design whilst maintaining, and extending, the expressive power of other similar macro systems. The core Genesis language definition lacks many of the desirable features found in other systems, such as quasi-quote, hygiene, and static expression-type dispatch, but is expressive enough to define these as syntax extensions. User-defined macros produce only well-formed syntactic structures via the use of a predefined set of classes that define a Java abstract syntax.  At the heart of Genesis is a flexible parser that is capable of parsing any context-free grammars - even ambiguous ones. The parser is capable of arbitrary speculation and will consider all possible parses. The parser constructs a graph of possible paths, and is capable of dynamically pruning this graph, or combining nodes, based on precedence or associativity rules. This general parser allows macro programmers to forget about parsing, and concentrate on defining new syntax. One key goal of this system was to address the programmer's learning curve by providing as simple a system as possible. This was achieved by the use of the flexible parser, the introduction of only one new construct to standard Java, and extensions to make programming macros more user friendly. The expressiveness of Genesis is wide ranging; it is capable of providing small scale limited use macros, large scale semantic modifications, through to complete language replacements.  To demonstrate this expressiveness, we implement many of the simple test cases found in other systems, such as a type-safe printf, assertions, and iteration statements. These test cases require an ability to perform static type-checking and to manipulate compile-time values and abstract syntax trees. As additional examples of Genesis' expressive power we also provide implementations of embedded subsets of SQL and Haskell. As a final proof of power, the Haskell subset can operate as a stand-alone extension independent of any recognisable Java code.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">280303 Programming Languages</field><field name="subject">280301 Programming Techniques</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/637</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/637/1/01Front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/637/2/02Whole.pdf</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Aspects of the morphological development and feeding performance of larval striped trumpeter (Latris lineata) in culture</field><field name="creator">Cobcroft, JM</field><field name="description">Striped trumpeter (Latris lineata) is a new candidate species for aquaculture in temperate Australia. Survival of larvae prior to flexion has proven a bottleneck in the production of this species for culture. In addition, almost all juveniles cultured to date exhibit malformations of the jaw that may impede larval feeding success. Body size and morphology impose constraints upon feeding success in larvae of broadcast spawning fishes. Furthermore, larvae have an absolute reliance upon sense organs for the detection and subsequent capture of prey. In this study, aspects of morphological development and feeding performance were described in larval striped trumpeter. Chemosensory and mechanosensory organs were present and presumed functional soon after hatching, while the eye was functional coincident with first-feeding on day 7 post-hatching. The structure of the photoreceptors in different regions of the retina of the larvae suggested the area specialised for the most acute image formation corresponded to a visual field in the fronto-ventral region. Analysis of videocinematography of feeding larvae in the horizontal plane confirmed a forward-directed functional visual field. The area of the visual field increased with larval ontogeny from day 13 to day 17 post-hatching, due to the wider range of reactive angles used by older larvae. Maximum reactive distances of larvae to rotifer prey (~5.1mm) were 97% of larval standard length, while the distance at which larvae initiated a strike at the prey was much lower (~0.45mm) at 8% of larval standard length. Visual angles determined from larval feeding behaviour were higher than the minimum separable angles predicted by histology, such that the functional acuity of the larvae was not as good as that predicted by retinal structure. Jaw malformation was only evident in post-flexion larvae greater than 10 mm standard length and was characterised by an open jaw in which cartilage and bone elements appeared structurally normal but were in abnormal positions. The effects of light intensity and microalgal cell density (turbidity) on larval feeding behaviour were assessed in short-term feeding trials. None of the pre-flexion larvae used to investigate optimal light conditions for feeding exhibited jaw malformations. Larvae fed equally well in clearwater (no microalgal cells present) in a light intensity range of 1-10 umol.s-1.m-2. An ontogenetic improvement in photopic visual sensitivity of larvae was indicated by improved feeding at 0.1 umol.s-1.m-2 between day 8 and day 23 post-hatching. Algae-induced turbidity had different effects on larval feeding response dependent upon the previous visual environment of the larvae. Young larvae, day 9 post-hatching, reared in clearwater showed decreased feeding capabilities with increasing turbidity, while older clearwater reared larvae fed well at all turbidities tested. Likewise, greenwater (with microalgal cells present) reared larvae had increased feeding capabilities in the highest algal cell densities tested compared with those in low algal cell density, and clearwater to which they were naive. This study demonstrated that striped trumpeter larvae are primarily visual feeders with a small visual field relative to larval body size, that jaw malformation is unlikely to impede feeding in pre-flexion larvae, and that greenwater may provide a benefit to larval feeding although the previous visual environment of larvae affected subsequent feeding responses.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">270503 Animal Anatomy and Histology</field><field name="subject">300703 Aquaculture</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/639</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/639/3/Front_matter.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/639/4/Cobcroft_JM_Thesis.pdf</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Steroids and Reproductive Biology in the Blotched Blue-tongued Lizard, Tiliqua nigrolutea</field><field name="creator">Edwards, A</field><field name="description">This thesis documents the annual profiles of the primary reproductive steroids testosterone (T), 17beta-oestradiol (E2) and progesterone (P4), in the reproductive cycles of male and female blue-tongued lizards, Tiliqua nigrolutea. Data collected from a large captive population over three consecutive reproductive seasons are included. Reproductive cycles are discussed in the context of other viviparous squamate reptiles, while a broader comparative approach is used to consider patterns of steroid biosynthesis and peripheral metabolism.  The annual patterns of circulating concentrations of T, E2 and P4 have been characterised for both sexes. In males, peak plasma T (10.9 +/- 3.00 ng ml-1) and E2 (778.0 +/- 120.00 pg ml-1) concentrations occur coincident with late spermatogenesis and observations of mating, respectively. Plasma P4 concentrations remain basal (&lt; 1.2 ng ml-1) throughout the annual reproductive cycle. In females, increasing plasma E2 concentrations (275.2 +/- 33.87 pg ml-1 - 715.1 +/- 106.68 pg ml-1) are associated with vitellogenesis and plasma T peaks (6.3 +/- 0.63 ng ml-1) in the mating and peri-ovulatory period. In pregnant females, plasma P4 concentrations are elevated for the first two thirds of gestation, peaking in the second trimester at 12.7 +/- 1.27 ng ml-1 and falling rapidly prior to parturition. Concurrently, plasma P4 concentrations in non-reproductively active adult females remain basal (1 - 2 ng ml-1) throughout the year.  There is good circumstantial evidence for a multiennial reproductive cycle in females. Parturition occurs late in the active season, presumably leaving little time for females to store sufficient fat reserves to become vitellogenic in the following spring: reproductive opportunities are effectively missed in at least one year following a reproductive effort. Observed reproductive behaviours, including agonistic male - male interactions, mating, and parturition, are documented.  An investigation of gonadal steroid biosynthetic pathways in this viviparous squamate is presented. This compares variation in the relative contributions of the delta-4 and delta-5 steroidogenic pathways according to sex and reproductive condition. The delta-4 pathway predominates in both sexes, aligning this species phylogenetically with other reptiles. However, there are clear differences between sexes and with changing reproductive condition in the patterns of production of pathway intermediates and end-products. Additionally, detection of a possibly novel polar steroid as a major end-product of steroid biosynthesis in both sexes is reported. Peripheral (extragonadal) metabolism of T and E2 in a number of reproductively relevant steroid target tissues is compared at times of year chosen to represent three clearly distinctive reproductive conditions in each sex. There are differences both between sexes, between tissue types and with changing reproductive condition in the relative proportions of steroid conjugates and non-conjugated derivatives produced. Biosynthetic pathway activity and peripheral steroid metabolism both appear to be plastic in response to changing reproductive condition in Tiliqua nigrolutea.  With a comprehensive database of information about the reproductive endocrinology and physiology of Tiliqua nigrolutea, this species is now available as a model to further examine selected aspects of the steroid hormone control of reproductive physiology and behaviour in a cool temperate, viviparous reptile.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">270604 Comparative Physiology</field><field name="subject">270603 Animal Physiology - Systems</field><field name="subject">270503 Animal Anatomy and Histology</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/667</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/667/1/front_matter_ashley.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/667/2/whole_thesis.pdf</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Provenance, Purity &amp; Price Premiums: Consumer Valuations of Organic &amp; Place-of-Origin Food Labelling</field><field name="creator">Paull, J</field><field name="description">China is now the world's largest food producer for many food categories, and has recently embarked on a major conversion to organic agriculture. Australian farmers have described their industry as in crisis due to increasing competition from imports; they have called for strengthening of country of origin labelling on food. Priestley (2005) noted the absence of data on the premium Australian consumers will pay, if any, for Australian food produce. Halpin (2004) has reported that the current premiums on organic food are well beyond what Australian consumers are likely to be willing to pay, and that this will probably inhibit the growth of the industry in Australia. Vogl, Kilcher &amp; Schmidt (2005) declare that consumers expect organic produce to be labelled with a regional identity. The present study set out to establish the values consumers place on organic, on provenance, and on faux-organic claims (Type II eco-labels), and to determine the interactions between these factors. Australian consumers (N=221) were surveyed online. Organic was valued at an 8.12% premium, and Certified Organic was valued at a 15.63% premium. The provenance Australia was valued at a 25.98% premium over China, and Tasmania was valued at a 31.59% premium over China. Both Natural and Eco added value, 2.48% and 2.84% respectively. Certified Organic attracted a lower premium when coupled with China (11.62%). This Organic x Provenance interaction was consistent with respondents declaring they lacked trust in Chinese labelling. Interaction effects for eight demographic variables, including age, education, and place of residence, are reported. Gender and income do not have a significant influence on consumer values. This study found that adjunctive labelling offers both Australian and Chinese producers the opportunity to add value to their produce. It found that Australian producers would be beneficiaries from implementation of the Fair Dinkum Food Campaign's call for Country of Origin Labelling (CoOL), which is currently lacking on processed food. It establishes that organic is a path for both Australian and Chinese producers to add value. It suggests that China's push into organic production has the potential to lead the world to an organic future, and continuing on this path may give China the opportunity to redefine the standard for internationally traded food as Certified Organic.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">300800 Environmental Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/690</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/690/1/01front3.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/690/2/02body.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/690/3/03appendices.pdf</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Entanglement, invariants, and

 The techniques of mathematical physics are plethora and have been developed
 for some time. The Markov model of phylogenetics and its analysis is a rela-
 tively new technique where most progress to date has been achieved by using
 discrete mathematics. This thesis takes a group theoretical approach to the
 problem by beginning with a remarkable mathematical parallel to the process
 of scattering in particle physics. This is shown to equate to branching events
 in the evolutionary history of molecular units. The major technical result of
 this thesis is the derivation of existence proofs and computational techniques
 for calculating polynomial group invariant functions on a multi-linear space
 where the group action is that relevant to a Markovian time evolution. The
 practical results of this thesis are an extended analysis of the use of invariant
 functions in distance based methods and the presentation of a new recon-

Then, using these techniques I will examine fluid immiscibility processes in two felsic magmatic systems, one mineralised, the other barren.  In particular, I address the constraints on the exsolution of magmatic vapour and aqueous liquids, and how it is manifested in quartz-hosted inclusions, as well as the nature and composition of the exsolved phases.  In developing a research philosophy two factors need to be paramount, it needs to be as widely applicable as possible, and the limitations need to be recognised and explored.  Thus, the results deriving from these techniques may provide a test of the methodology.	The thesis is based on two case studies, Rio Blanco (Chile) and Okataina (New Zealand).  The first case study involves sub-volcanic intrusives and associated extrusives from the La Copa Rhyolite, and intrusives from the Don Luis Porphyry, two post-ore rhyolitic suites from the Los Bronces-Rio Blanco Porphyry Cu-Mo deposit.  The second case study involves rhyolitic lavas (&lt; 65 Ka) from the Okataina Volcanic Centre in the Taupo Volcanic Zone in New Zealand.  This study is not intended to examine the geology of these systems, but rather to use them as examples of felsic systems, in diverse tectonic settings.  Both as test cases for developing robust research techniques and for any information that they can provide regarding late-stage magmatic processes, particularly volatile phase exsolution, and the role of melt/fluid and liquid/vapour immiscibility.	At Rio Blanco, the melt inclusion populations consist predominantly of glass inclusions and coexisting dark, inhomogeneous crystalline silicate melt inclusions (CSMI's).  An important discovery from this study is the recognition that CSMI's trap volatile-rich melt, probably identical to the melt trapped as glass inclusions, and are crystallised, not "devitrified" or the product of post-magmatic alteration.  Heating experiments demonstrate that both the glass and CSMI's from Rio Blanco have decrepitated and degassed post-trapping, notwithstanding the apparent lack of petrographic indicators of degassing in the glass inclusions.  This coexistence appears to be a common occurrence; however, its significance seems to have been overlooked in a number of previous studies.	From an initial volatile-rich melt, aqueous volatile phases (dominantly vapour) exsolved, forming bubbly magmatic emulsions.  Inherently, magmatic emulsions are metastable, and disrupt into discrete melt and vapour phases.  The vapour-rich phases separated from the melt and escaped, cooling, condensing, and mixing as they did so.  Rio Blanco melt inclusions and fluid inclusions trapped all of these phases, in various combinations, both demonstrating the process in fine detail, and sampling the phase compositions.  Analysis of the phases demonstrates partitioning of metals (Cu, Zn, and possibly Pb) into the vapour phase, its transport out of some of the magma bodies, and implies concentration by mixing and condensing to form metal-rich hypersaline fluid inclusions in the carapace of the Don Luis Porphyry.	The Okataina case study provided an invaluable counterpoint to Rio Blanco.  Phenocryst crystallisation pressures were supercritical, although the evidence suggests that volatile phase exsolution (VPE) occurred post- rather than pre-trapping, so that trapped magmatic emulsions are not observed.  Okataina also contains coexisting CSMI's and glass inclusions, although many of the samples contains a complex array of partly crystalline silicate melt inclusions.  Importantly for this study, many of the inclusions do homogenise during experimental heating, indicating that decrepitation and degassing were not as pronounced as at Rio Blanco.  Heating experiments showed that despite coexisting CSMI's and glass inclusions, there was only a single melt trapped.  This provides evidence of the post-trapping behaviour of melt inclusions, lacking at Rio Blanco.  Although pre-trapping VPE did not occur to a large degree, post-trapping VPE did.  Inclusions in which exsolution of an aqueous volatile phase has occurred provide a measure and sample of the amounts of fluids that were exsolved from a known quantity of melt, and may provide a method of determining the actual amounts of hydrothermal fluids that a magma body may exsolve.	In evaluating these results some inevitable limitations of the techniques have been uncovered, particularly those relating to the vagaries of melt inclusion formation and preservation, and these have been evaluated.  However, qualitative, and to some extent quantitative results have been produced, some of which have been published in research journals.  Together, the case studies demonstrate and sample the fine detail of the exsolution of volatile-rich phases from silicate melts, their escape from those melts, and eventual cooling and condensing to form the kinds of hypersaline hydrothermal fluids found as fluid inclusions in ore-bodies.  Further, they provide insights into common post-trapping behaviours of melt inclusions, some aspects of which appear to have been misinterpreted in some published melt inclusion studies.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">260102 Igneous and Metamorphic Petrology</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/710</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/710/1/Paul_Davidson_Thesis_1.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/710/2/thesis2_davidson.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/710/3/Davidson_Thesis_3.pdf</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effect of monounsaturated fat in the diet on the serum carotenoid levels</field><field name="creator">Ahuja, KDK</field><field name="description">Epidemiological data suggest that populations with higher serum/ tissue levels of
 carotenoids have a lower risk of coronary heart disease (CHD), possibly due to
 the antioxidant capacity. Lycopene, a carotenoid mainly found in tomatoes, has
 been suggested to have the greatest antioxidant capacity of the carotenoids found
 in fruits and vegetables. Carotenoids are fat-soluble compounds and their
 absorption from the diet into the body may depend on the amount of dietary fat
 ingested.
 For years there has been debate about what energy source should replace the
 saturated fat in the diet, to give the optimum serum lipid profile to reduce CHD
 risk. Studies have compared monounsaturated fat rich diets with high
 carbohydrate, low fat diets and have found that both diets decrease serum
 cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels. Results for
 high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and triglycerides have been
 inconsistent. However, it is of interest to study the effects of different diets on
 lipid oxidation, as this may also influence CHD risk.
 Studies have investigated the effect of different amounts of total fat on the serum
 levels of carotenoids especially beta-carotene and lutein, but to our knowledge no
 study has looked at the effect of different amounts of fats on the serum lycopene
 levels, and whether this could subsequently affect the oxidation of LDL in vitro.
 XIV
 Two separate randomised crossover dietary intervention studies were conducted;
 one in healthy men and the other in healthy women aged 20 to 70 years. The aim
 was to compare the effects of monounsaturated fat rich (MUFA) diet (38% of
 energy from fat) and high carbohydrate low fat (HCLF) diet (15% energy from
 fat) with controlled lycopene content, on serum lycopene levels. Main sources of
 lycopene in the diets were canned tomatoes and tomato soup for the study in
 women (lycopene content -15.9 mg/day) and tomato paste and tomato soup for
 the study in men (lycopene content - 20.2 mg/day). Serum lipids and lipoproteins
 levels and in vitro oxidation of LDL particles were also measured.
 Compared to the baseline levels there was a significant increase in the serum
 trans lycopene and total lycopene levels after MUFA diet for the study in women.
 Comparing the levels at the end of the two diets no difference was observed. In
 the study in men serum trans, cis and total lycopene levels increased after the
 MUFA and HCLF diet periods. There was no significant difference in trans; cis
 and total lycopene levels at the end of two diets.
 Thus, high levels of monounsaturated fat in the diet do not appear to increase
 lycopene absorption and serum levels compared to very low fat diet. There was
 however a better serum lipid profile after MUFA diet compared to HCLF diet.
 Lag phase for the in vitro oxidation of LDL particles was also longer on the
 MUFA diet. The lack of difference in antioxidant levels would indicate that this
 was due to the different fatty acid component of the diet.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="subject">321205 Nutrition and Dietetics</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/737</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/737/1/Front-Matter.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/737/2/Whole-Thesis.pdf</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mean flow, eddy variability and energetics of the Subantarctic Front south of Australia</field><field name="creator">Phillips, HE</field><field name="description">This thesis describes the variability and mean flow of the Subantarctic Front
 (SAF) south of Australia using time series measurements of velocity and
 temperature from 1993 to 1995, and six hydrographic transects along WOCE
 line SR3 from Tasmania to Antarctica over the period 1991 to 1996. The SAF
 is the strongest jet of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) south of
 Australia. The time series of velocity and temperature are only the third such
 dataset collected in the ACC and provide insight into the dynamics of this
 massive current and into the heat and momentum balances of the Southern
 Ocean.
 The SAF was found to be an energetic, meandering jet with vertically coherent
 fluctuations. These fluctuations varied on a timescale of 20 days, and had a
 typical amplitude of 30 cm/s at 1150 dbar. The analysis used a coordinate
 frame that rotated daily to be in alignment with the direction of flow. This
 allowed the mesoscale variability of the SAF to be isolated from variability due
 to meandering of the front and proved very successful for examining eddy
 fluxes. Vertically averaged cross-stream eddy heat flux was 11.3 kW/m^2
 poleward and was significantly different from zero at the 95% confidence level
 for fluctuations with periods between 2 and 90 days. Zonally integrated, this
 eddy heat flux (=0.9x10^15 W) is more than large enough to balance the heat
 lost south of the Polar Front and is as large as cross-SAF fluxes found in Drake
 Passage. Cross-stream eddy momentum fluxes were small and not significantly
 different from zero but were tending to decelerate the mean flow. A relationship
 between vertical motion and meander phase identified in the Gulf Stream was
 found to hold for the SAF. Eddy kinetic energy levels were similar to those in
 Drake Passage and southeast of New Zealand. Eddy potential energy was up to
 an order of magnitude larger than at the other ACC sites, most likely because
 meandering of the front is more common south of Australia. Baroclinic
 conversion was found to be the dominant mechanism by which eddies grow
 south of Australia. The typical time for the growth of an eddy is estimated to
 be 30 days, approximately half that in Drake Passage. This is consistent with
 observations from satellite altimetry which indicate that eddy energy is growing
 rapidly downstream of the Australian measurement site, while the eddy field in
 Drake Passage is mature.
 Mean cross-stream profiles of absolute and baroclinic velocity in the SAF at five
 current meter levels have been obtained from two streamwise profiling
 techniques using specific volume anomaly at 780 dbar as the cross-stream
 coordinate. One of the techniques, using hydrographic data to estimate the
 baroclinic velocity profile, is presented for the first time. The mean SAF
 velocity profile is composed of one central peak, reaching 52 and 34 cm/s at
 420 dbar, absolute and baroclinic respectively, and several smaller peaks. The
 SAF flow is coherent at all levels, reaches the sea floor, and is at least 220 km
 wide. The cross-stream structure of baroclinic and absolute transport of the
 SAF has been characterized for the first time. The integrated mean transport is
 at least 116+/-10 x 10^6 m^3/s, of which approximately 14% is barotropic. The
 linear conditions for baroclinic and barotropic instability are satisfied at the
 array, consistent with the eddy growth rates calculated.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">260403 Physical Oceanography</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/814</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/814/1/front_thesis.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/814/2/thesis.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/814/3/thesis_fig1p1.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/814/4/thesis_fig1p2.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/814/5/thesis_fig1p3.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/814/6/thesis_fig2p2.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/814/7/thesis_fig2p4.pdf</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of past sun exposure in Multiple Sclerosis</field><field name="creator">van der Mei, IAF</field><field name="description">This epidemiological thesis firstly reviews the disease Multiple Sclerosis (MS): its history, pathology, clinical expression, and the current views on immunopathogenesis, aetiology and treatment. A separate review on ultraviolet radiation (UVR) and MS indicates that recent work in photoimmunology provides evidence that UVR can attenuate T helper 1 cell mediated processes through several mechanisms, and that epidemiological features of MS, such as the striking latitudinal gradient and seasonal variation in month of birth, MS onset and disease activity, are at least in part consistent with the hypothesis that UVR exposure may reduce the risk of MS. An ecological analysis was conducted as part of the PhD to demonstrate that regional variation in MS prevalence in the continent of Australia could be closely predicted by regional UVR levels, but analytical epidemiological studies are required to further investigate the UVR hypothesis.  The project central to this thesis was a population based case-control study on Multiple Sclerosis, conducted in Tasmania, Australia. It examined: (i) whether high past sun exposure was associated with a reduced risk of MS, (ii) whether sibship structure and past infections influenced the risk of MS and (iii) whether having had children and differences in prevalence and strength of MS risk factors between men and women could explain the sex difference in MS. Interviews were conducted with 136 cases with MS and 272 controls randomly drawn from the community and matched on sex and birth year. In one of the methodology chapters, a measure-retest and method comparison was conducted to examine aspects of reliability of the sun exposure measures used in the case-control study. A separate study on 104 healthy volunteers was carried out to examine the effect of seasonal variation and body hair on melanin density estimates based on skin reflectance. The case-control study showed that higher past sun exposure, particularly during childhood and early adolescence, was associated with a reduced risk of MS, which is compatible with UVR having a protective role against MS. Having younger siblings, but not older siblings, was also associated with a reduced risk of MS, while having had glandular fever or having high antibody titers against the Epstein-Barr virus was associated with an increased risk of MS. Among women, a negative association was found between having had children and MS. The finding of an inverse association between sun exposure during childhood and early adolescence and MS, if confirmed in future work, will have important public health implications.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321202 Epidemiology</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/884</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/884/1/Front_matter_Ingrid_4_final.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/884/2/PhD_thesis_Ingrid_4_final.pdf</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Chickpeas and Human Health:

 exhibiting lower rates of cardiovascular disease (CVD). The following
 studies examined the effect of including chickpeas in an 'Australian' diet
 on CVD risk factors. Participants were free-living volunteers aged 30 to 70
 years.
 Study 1 investigated the effect of chickpeas on serum lipids, lipoproteins,
 glycaemic control, bowel function and satiation (degree of fullness leading
 to meal cessation) compared to a higher-fibre wheat-supplemented diet
 (Chapter 2). Participants completed two controlled dietary interventions
 (chickpea-supplemented and higher-fibre wheat-supplemented), isocaloric
 with their usual dietary intake, in random order. The design of the
 intervention diets was for matched macronutrient content and dietary fibre
 however increased consumption of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA)
 during the chickpea-supplemented diet was noted. Small but significant
 reductions in mean serum total cholesterol and low density lipoproteincholesterol
 (LDL-C) were reported following the chickpea diet compared to
 the wheat. Statistical analysis suggested a relationship between increased
 consumption of PUFA and reduction in cholesterol during the chickpea
 intervention but could not discern the source of PUFA. Chickpea
 supplementation did not adversely affect bowel function and participants
 found them very satiating. There was no effect on glycaemic control. A
 small, sub-study compared the effects of an isocaloric, lower-fibre wheat diet to the higher-fibre wheat, to evaluate the effect of quantity of fibre as
 well as source on bowel health and satiety. During the lower-fibre wheat
 intervention, some participants reported lower satiation, and poorer bowel
 health.
 Some of the results from this study were included in a larger, collaborative
 study investigating the effect of chickpeas on serum lipids and lipoproteins
 in two centres, Launceston and Melbourne. The Melbourne group followed
 a similar controlled, random crossover comparison of a chickpeasupplemented
 diet to a higher-fibre wheat-supplemented diet, also
 endeavouring to match macronutrient content and dietary fibre. The
 Melbourne group also reported small but significant reductions in mean
 serum LDL- and total cholesterol but reported discrepancies in
 consumption of PUFA as well as dietary fibre between the intervention
 diets. Statistical analysis of the combined results suggested a relationship
 between increased consumption of PUFA and dietary fibre and a reduction
 in cholesterol during the chickpea intervention. Appendix 1 is a description

 Study 2 investigated whether results from the controlled study would
 translate to ad libitum situations (Chapter 3). The study followed an
 ordered crossover design where participants followed their habitual ad
 libitum dietary intake for four weeks (familiarisation phase), incorporated a
 minimum of four 300g (net weight) cans of chickpeas per week for 12 weeks and then resumed their habitual diet for another four weeks (usual
 phase). Small but significant reductions in body weight, body mass index
 (BMI), serum TC, fasting insulin and HOMA-IR occurred following the
 chickpea phase, compared to the post-chickpea usual phase. Results
 suggested that participants positively altered their eating pattern during the
 pre-chickpea familiarisation phase, sustained these changes during the
 12-week chickpea phase but regressed during the usual phase.
 Participants consumed significantly more dietary fibre and PUFA during
 the chickpea phase and less total fat and saturated fatty acids (SFA)
 compared to the usual phase. Perceived bowel health remained constant
 throughout the study, while satiation increased significantly during the
 chickpea phase along with a small but significant reduction in mean body
 weight.
 Incorporating chickpeas into an 'Australian' style diet resulted in increased
 consumption of PUFA and dietary fibre that produced small but significant
 reductions in serum TC, BMI and glycaemic control, high satiation and little
 effect on bowel function. Individuals wishing to reduce CVD risk may
 choose to include chickpeas in their diet.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321200 Public Health and Health Services</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/930</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/930/1/Frmttd_Thss_06final_01Front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/930/2/Frmttd_Thss_06final_02Whole.pdf</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The organisational culture of a ship : a description and some possible effects it has on accidents and lessons for seafaring leadership</field><field name="creator">Shea, IP</field><field name="description">This study was intended to further the understanding of organisational culture and climate on board a ship, it also explored the linkages that these two broad areas had with marine accidents. The study was designed to represent, as broadly as possible, the views of seafarers all around the world. An extensive literature search of databases in the maritime, education and other cognate fields, revealed only two other studies that dealt with some of the issues examined by this study. 
 
 The study also examined literature dealing with investigations into maritime accidents, as many of the causal factors identified by these investigations assisted the study in its examination of the organisational culture and climate of a ship. This study addresses three key questions: What is the nature of the organisational culture aboard a ship? What is the nature of the organisational climate aboard a ship? and, Are there any aspects of organisational culture and climate that impact on the safety culture of a ship? This thesis therefore contains descriptions of the organisational culture and climate aboard ships, to facilitate a better understanding of the environment within which ships operate. In examining these two areas this study focussed mainly upon the safety culture and climate of a ship, as the span of each of the earlier described areas was large and covered many issues. This study used a research approach that combined elements of quantitative and qualitative methods. This mixed-mode was deemed the way to proceed as the researcher wished to utilise data gathering approaches that have been used in both broad research approaches, i.e., a questionnaire, metaphorical analysis, and document analysis. This mixedmode approach allowed the investigation of issues within a bounded system, but where the participants were widely dispersed and not readily accessible for extended face-to-face data gathering. 
 
 The study utilised three instruments for data gathering, which generated three datasets. These datasets provided the basis on which the statistical analysis was conducted. The three instruments used in the survey were the 'Maritime Culture Questionnaire' (MCQ), 'Assumptions through Metaphor' (AtM) Questionnaire and the 'Maritime Climate Questionnaire' (MClQ). The total number of seafarers who participated in the instrument survey was over 700 persons and like most surveys of this kind there was a slight variation in the number of respondents for each instrument. Analysis of the datasets enabled the organisational culture aboard ship to be described comprehensively. This analysis demonstrated that Heads of Departments (HODs) and seafarers displayed either one of two distinct behavioural characteristics when they worked aboard ship. The first characteristic behaviour was the 'HOD Collegial Behaviour' type, here the HOD would be positive and demonstrably supportive toward subordinates. The other characteristic behaviour was the 'HOD Formalistic Behaviour' type, when displaying this type of behaviour the HOD showed indifference toward subordinates and their activities. When a HOD displayed this latter behaviour, respondents indicated that it had a negative impact on the safety climate of a ship. The addition of outcome variables to the MCQ instrument permitted linkages to be made between the organisational culture aboard ships and marine accidents. Similarly an analysis of the third dataset enabled the development of a description of the organisational climate of a ship. This examination of the organisational climate of a ship identified situations when seafarers were likely to display the described behavioural characteristics. The study also found that it is possible that these negative behaviours were displayed more often than the positive ones. The findings of this study make recommendations that will assist in improving the safety climate on board ships. This study makes recommendations that have relevance to personnel managers of shipping companies or ship-management companies, maritime regulatory authorities, maritime educators and Heads of Departments on board ships.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">339900 Other Education</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/1023</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/1023/1/01Front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/1023/2/02Whole.pdf</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The political economy of currency transaction taxes</field><field name="creator">Willans, P</field><field name="description">The speculative currency transaction markets are the largest capital markets in the world with an estimated US$2 trillion being traded every day. By comparison the daily global transactions related to international trade, goods and services represent only a small proportion of capital trades. Speculative flight in times of capital crises has triggered major social and economic disruptions such as those in Mexico (1994), East Asia (1997-98) Russia (1998), Brazil (1999), Turkey (2000) and Argentina (2001). Smaller crises occur regularly including currency speculation losses by the Reserve Bank of Australia in 2002 and corporate disruptions from trading losses incurred by the National Bank of Australia in 2004.  Recently (May 2006) hedge funds withdrew vast quantities of capital from Iceland and New Zealand causing major disruptions to financial systems in both countries.   Each disruption causes trauma to small and institutional investors and to civil society. The proliferation of transactions and the rise in accommodating and secretive offshore tax havens has created a global shadow economy, which has essentially reconfigured capitalism in modern times. This paper examines the political economy of financial market reform and the financial architecture required to implement a currency transaction tax.  The thesis defends an argument in support of global currency transaction taxes based on proposals originally made by Keynes, Tobin, Spahn and Schmidt. There is an urgent need to account for the effects created by the speculative and volatile global shadow economy.  Recent developments in hedge fund regulation measures demonstrate that the lobbying power of new financial players create major problems for policymakers and global financial security.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">340200 Applied Economics</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/1034</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/1034/1/Political_Economy_of_Currency_Transaction_Taxes_FRONT.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/1034/2/Political_Economy_of_Currency_Transaction_Taxes_WHOLE.pdf</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Gene technology, risk, regulation and communication</field><field name="creator">Gogarty, B</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the social, political and legal basis for the establishment of a national regime for the oversight of risks posed by gene technology in Australia. It provides an overview of the public debate about gene technology and considers how that debate served to motivate and shift the focus of regulatory reform which led to the Gene Technology Act 2000 (Cth) (GTA). The debate about gene technology belies a much deeper social preoccupation with novel risk generally - something described by risk theorists as the 'risk society'. This risk society has placed pressure on legislatures to manage the perceived risks posed by novel technologies or to use novel technologies to manage man-made or natural risks. Yet the traditionally prescriptive and cumbersome process of regulatory reform is ill-suited to the pace and transient nature of scientific innovation. Consequently, legislatures have developed a new legislative form, risk governance, designed to provide a more flexible scientifically based response to novel technologies. This form of legislation is exemplified by the GTA. Yet risk governance has proved to create problems of its own. Maintaining regulatory flexibility necessitates that rule making is virtually, if not officially, undertaken outside of the parliamentary process. Furthermore, because risk governance adopts a scientifically based assessment and management process (risk analysis) it must co-opt technical specialists (the subjects of regulation) into the decision making process. These factors have contributed to risk governance being perceived as anti-democratic in some quarters. Such perceptions are agitated by a growing distrust of technocrat's ability to serve the public interest in the risk society. Lack of trust was a major theme throughout the Australian gene technology debate. The response to public distrust in technocratic oversight of novel technology has been the inception of risk communication, a process that encourages public involvement in risk analysis. Unfortunately, best practice risk communication has tended to be promulgated in policy but avoided in practice - something revealed with the commercialisation of gene technology. This has resulted in increased pressure to put promise into practice by institutionalising participatory risk communication principles within risk governance. I have referred to this more democratic regulatory form as 'deliberative risk governance'. The GTA was enacted with the promise that it would involve the public in all aspects of regulating risks posed by gene technology. I consider how we arrived at such a system, if it matters and whether the promise of deliberative risk governance is real, efficacious and genuine within this act.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">390100 Law</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/1041</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/1041/1/bgogarty_PhD_2006_front-matter.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/1041/2/bgogarty_PhD_2006_print2.pdf</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reproductive success and demography of the Orange-bellied Parrot Neophema chrysogaster</field><field name="creator">Holdsworth, MC</field><field name="description">The Orange-bellied Parrot is one of only two obligate migratory parrots in the world. The species is listed nationally as endangered and has been the subject of intensive study and conservation activities over the past 25 years. Reproductive and demographic data collected over this period from the wild population form the basis of this thesis. Remote breeding sites in southwestern Tasmania at Melaleuca and Birchs Inlet were used to study this species in the wild. Through deployment of up to 52 artificial nest boxes and observations of natural nests at Melaleuca it was possible to collect information on a range of reproductive success parameters over a long period, including 12 consecutive breeding seasons. In addition, the provision of up to 33 nest boxes over seven consecutive years at Birchs Inlet provided a comparison with the use of nest boxes by several competitors at Melaleuca. The use of colour-bands to identify 760 individuals from 16 different cohorts provided the means to assess a range of behavioural and demographic parameters of the species. This study confirmed the Orange-bellied Parrot has a regular migratory pattern with birds beginning to return to the breeding area on the 2nd October (plus or minus 5.1 days s.d) in each year. The first birds to return are those in their second year of life or older, while first-year adult birds begin to arrive 13 days later. The median arrival date for birds in their second year or older was the 23rd October compared with 9th November for firstyear adult birds. There was no difference between the sexes in arrival date. The mean date of last departure from Melaleuca was 5th April (plus or minus 11.1 days s.d). A total of 190 nests with known contents were studied in the wild and, of these 185 nests contained eggs and five nests contained no eggs. This study found the earliest laying date was on the 29th November and the latest was the 19th January with eggs (95%) laid during December (n = 101 eggs). Clutch size ranged from 2-6 eggs with over half of the clutches having 5 eggs and 95.3% of all clutches 4-6 eggs in size. The mean clutch size was 4.7 eggs per active nest across all years and there was no evidence the species can produce second clutches in the wild. The mean incubation period for Orange-bellied Parrot eggs was 21.4 plus or minus 0.8 days (n = 49 observed incubations). The mean dimensions of unhatched eggs was 22.9 plus or minus 0.98 mm by 18.5 plus or minus 0.67 mm (n = 99 eggs). The 185 nests with eggs studied by this work contained a total of 874 eggs. Of these 695 eggs hatched and 179 eggs failed to hatch. Of the 179 failures, 107 eggs (69.7%) were infertile, 48 eggs (26.8%) were fertile and 24 eggs (13.4%) were of unknown fertility. Of the 48 unhatched fertile eggs, 23 eggs (47.9%) were early-term failures, 15 eggs (31.2%) were mid-term failures and 10 eggs (20.8%) were late-term failures. The mean egg fertility rate for the species was calculated to be 85.6% (plus or minus 2.91 s.e). Hatching success from all eggs laid was 79.5% (i.e. 695 nestlings hatched from 874 eggs laid) with the mean hatching success across all years being 80.2%. A total of 89 nestlings died prior to fledging. Early stage deaths represented 44.9% (n = 40) of all mortalities and late stage deaths 55.1% (n = 49). The annual egg failure and nestling mortality varied across years. Of a total of 268 egg and nestling failures across all years, 66.8% (n = 179 eggs) were attributable to hatch failure and 33.2% (n = 89 nestlings) to mortality. Unhatched infertile eggs represented most (39.9%, n = 107) of all failures. Of the 190 nesting attempts, only 27 failed to produce any young. The most common cause of total nest failure was attributed to failure to hatch (44.4%, n = 12) followed by nestling deaths (37%, n = 10) and no eggs laid (18.5%, n = 5). Average brood size was 4.0 nestlings plus or minus 0.09 s.e (range = 1-6) from 173 nests with 65.9% of nests producing four (33.5%) or five (32.4%) nestlings. The majority of nests produced four fledglings with a mean fledgling brood size of 3.7 plus or minus 0.09 s.e (range = 1-6) from the 163 successful nests. Only 4.3% of successful nests produced the maximum of six fledglings. Of the 190 Orange-bellied Parrot nests studied, 85.8% (n = 163) produced fledglings. The distribution of nest productivity is presented and discussed in detail. The number of fledglings produced per breeding attempt varied between zero and six. A total of 69% of all nests produced 3-5 fledglings whereas 33% of all nests produced four fledglings. The fledging success for 12 consecutive breeding seasons was 87.2% (606 fledglings from 695 nestlings) and the mean fledging success across all years was 86.9% (plus or minus 2.47 s.e). The overall breeding success for the Orange-bellied Parrot was 69.3% (606 fledglings from 874 eggs laid). The overall reproductive output of the species was 3.3 fledglings per nest (606 fledglings from 185 nests) from an investment of 4.7 eggs laid. Egg fertility, nestling survival and fledgling survival of Orange-bellied Parrots in the wild is noticeably higher than for the captive population, and is equal to or exceeds many other Psittacidae. The reproductive success results reported here are comparable with the more common Turquoise Parrot Neophema pulchella of mainland Australia. Although the Orange-bellied Parrot has a healthy mean fecundity rate of 1.62 females/egg laying female, there was some variability between years, with a low of 0.87 females/egg laying female in 1998/99. The mean lifespan of the Orange-bellied Parrot was calculated to be 2.22 years (plus or minus 0.074 s.e, range = 0.37-11.70, N = 693) with no significant difference between male and females. Males lived on average for 2.75 years (plus or minus 0.127 s.e, range = 0.43-11.70, n = 240) and females lived on average for 2.67 years (plus or minus 0.141 s.e, range = 0.18-10.41, n = 189). The oldest male recorded was 11.70 years of age and the oldest female recorded was 10.41 years of age. This study was not able to compare the reproductive lifespan of wild Orange-bellied Parrots with captive-bred birds due to database problems or with other Psittacidae due to lack of comparable studies. The capacity to compare the wild population with captive-bred birds and other Psittacidae will greatly enhance our knowledge of the species. This work suggests the Orange-bellied Parrot does not have a strong fidelity to mates, nest site or nesting zone. This finding is contrary to previous assumptions made about the species. This study did not measure hollow availability; however, a comparison of the use of nest boxes between Birchs Inlet and Melaleuca indicates competition from introduced species may be limiting the breeding range and reproductive success. Survivorship rates of juveniles to first breeding (c. one year old), adults and both sexes were determined. Mean survivorship of juveniles over the study was 55% (plus or minus  3.2 s.e) and is within expected limits when compared to other Psittacidae. Mean survivorship of adults was 63.6% (plus or minus 2.0 s.e). There was a decreasing trend in survival rates across all cohorts from 1999 onward with average annual survival declining markedly thereafter. The reason for this decline is unclear. There was no difference in survival rate of each sex over the study. This study has significantly increased our understanding of the reproductive success and demography of the Orange-bellied Parrot. This information will reduce the level of uncertainty in the Population Viability Analysis model for the species and, in turn, increase the power of such models to assess the species status and test the effectiveness of conservation measures. Some of the results of this study have important implications for future research and conservation of the species. These are discussed, and include management of nest boxes, refinement of mark-recapture studies, population viability analysis and influence of introduced nest competitors.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">270706 Life Histories (incl.

The primary aim of my study is to examine the circumstances in which women kill their violent partners and to explore the ability of the criminal law to have proper regard to these circumstances. The interaction between the criminal law and battered women who kill their violent partners is a topical issue that has generated substantial interest and debate in many western countries. 
 My thesis provides an empirical study detailing the legal outcome and circumstances of the killing in the 76 cases identified where women have killed their male partner. In the context of these findings, I examine reliance on the various defences to murder (diminished responsibility, provocation, lack of the requisite intent for murder, self-defence, insanity and automatism). The argument advanced is that the current approach of the Australian criminal justice system to battered women who kill reveals sympathy for their situation, but a failure to adequately consider whether these circumstances provide the basis for self-defence. 
 I examine the procedural rules that interact with the substantive law of self-defence to constrain a battered woman's ability to convey the reality of her experience of violence to the fact-finder. In facilitating reliance on self-defence, I propose a shift in the current evidentiary approach to battered women who kill from the 'battered woman syndrome' framework to the reception of social framework evidence in its own right. 
 My thesis also includes a consideration of the judicial approach in sentencing women who kill their violent partners. My analysis suggests that there is sympathy for the woman's situation, however there is not an adequate recognition of the mitigatory impact of a history of violence. The dominant judicial approach to mitigation appears to be premised according to principles of 'mercy' and 'sympathy' for women who can position themselves as the 'appropriate victim'.
 Although focusing on the Australian criminal justice system, my thesis has potential application beyond this context.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">390400 Law Enforcement</field><field name="subject">390405 Correctional Theory and Services; Penology</field><field name="subject">390100 Law</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/1045</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/1045/1/Bradfield-front-matter.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/1045/2/Bradfield_ch1.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/1045/3/Bradfield_ch2.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/1045/4/Bradfield_ch3.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/1045/5/Bradfield_ch4.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/1045/6/Bradfield_ch5.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/1045/7/Bradfield_ch6.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/1045/8/Bradfield_ch7.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/1045/9/Bradfield_ch8.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/1045/10/Bradfield_conclusions.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/1045/11/Bradfield_bibliography.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/1045/12/Bradfield_appendix.pdf</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">DNA-based Methods for Studying the Diet of Marine Predators</field><field name="creator">Deagle, BE</field><field name="description">Diets of large marine predators have been extensively studied to assess interactions with fisheries, monitor links between diet and reproductive success, and understand trophic interactions in marine ecosystems. Since marine species can rarely be observed foraging directly, most studies rely on the identification of prey remains in stomach contents or faeces to determine the prey items being consumed. While this approach has provided a wealth of information, it has several limitations resulting primarily from difficulties identifying digested prey and from biased recovery of remains due to differential digestion. My thesis explores the use of molecular genetic methods in dietary studies of large marine predators. DNA-based identification techniques have been used in several diet studies, but the methods and applications are still in the early stages of development. Through a number of studies, I investigated the ability to recover genetic data from various dietary samples using a range of genetic techniques. A) Genetic screening for prey in the gut contents from a giant squid - I assessed the use of polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based methods for isolation of prey DNA from an Architeuthis gut content sample. A taxonomically informative molecular marker was selected and a screening method developed using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis. The methodology was used to identify prey from otherwise unidentifiable hard-part remains and the amorphous slurry component of the squid gut sample. The techniques developed here provided a framework for later chapters. B) Analysis of prey DNA in faeces of captive sea lions Part I: DNA detection, distribution and signal persistence - A feeding trial with captive Steller sea lions (Eumetopias jubatus) was carried out to investigate the use of genetic faecal analysis as a tool to study diet. I used group-specific PCR detection to determine: (i) the reliability of prey DNA recovery, (ii) the distribution of prey DNA within faeces and (iii) the persistence of the genetic signal after a prey item was removed from the diet. The proportions of prey DNA in several samples were also determined using a clone library approach to determine if DNA quantification could provide semi-quantitative diet composition data. Results show that the prey DNA could be reliably detected in sea lion faeces and the genetic signal could persist in samples up to 48 hours after ingestion. Proportions of prey DNA isolated from faeces were roughly proportional to the mass of the prey items consumed. Part II: DNA quantification - Quantitative real-time PCR was used to further investigate if quantitative diet composition data could be obtained through quantification of the DNA present in faeces. I quantified the relative amounts of DNA in three fish species being fed to captive sea lions, then determined the amount of DNA recovered from these prey items in the sea lions - faeces. The results indicate that diet composition estimates based on the relative amounts of DNA in faeces can be biased due to the differential survival of DNA from different fish species; however, these biases may be less than those commonly observed in the conventional analysis of prey hard remains. C) Quantification of damage in DNA recovered from faecal samples - I developed a general method to quantify the frequency of DNA damage present in specific gene regions. The technique was applied to assess the amount of DNA damage in predator and prey DNA recovered from sea lion faeces. The estimated frequency of DNA damage was always higher for the prey DNA than for the predator DNA within a faecal sample. The findings have implications for marker development and comparison of results obtained in future DNA-based diet studies. D) Studying seabird diet through genetic analysis of faeces - I investigated the diet of macaroni penguins (Eudyptes chrysolophus) through conventional analysis of stomach contents and through the analysis of prey DNA extracted from faeces. Genetic data was obtained from faecal samples using PCR tests to determine the presence or absence of DNA from potential diet items and also using a clone library approach. Approximately half of the faecal samples tested positive for one or more of the prey groups targeted with PCR tests. Euphausiid DNA was most commonly detected in early stages of chick rearing and DNA from a myctophid fish was prevalent in faeces collected later; this trend mirrored the data obtained from the stomach contents. Analysis of prey sequences in 'universal'clone libraries revealed a highly biased recovery of sequences from fish prey; this bias is most likely caused by the use of degenerate primers with a higher binding affinity for fish DNA template compared to DNA from other prey groups. Results obtained from the genetic and traditional approaches are compared, and potential future applications of the genetic techniques to studying seabird diet are discussed. This series of studies has contributed significantly to our understanding of the strengths and the limitations of DNA-based diet analysis. The work identifies situations where genetic methods can be successfully applied to study the diet of marine predators and provides guidance for future studies in this emerging field.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">270702 Marine and Estuarine Ecology (incl.

Extinct plants distil and foreshadow my broader concerns for the future of all living entities. The plants that are lost due to extinction are often the silent victims of our land use practices. 
 
 Making nature: Extinct Tasmanian plants, is an installation of art works that commemorate the extinction of twenty two Tasmanian plants. The art works take the form of embroidered wreaths, funeral urns and a memorial board. My aim in creating the art work is to encourage reflection regarding the role that members of our society have played in the loss of these plants. We may unwittingly be contributing to extinction and thereby &#226;&#128;&#152;making nature&#226;&#128;&#153; in the process.
 
 A part of my motivation for creating this body of work has been to highlight the grief I feel when I learn that a plant species has been extinguished. My objective has been to represent the extinct plants in a manner that may elicit an experience of beauty amongst the viewers of my art. Beauty has the potential to arouse meaningful connections between the viewer and the plants, whereas, extinction eradicates that possibility and destroys the prospect of relationships between living things. Therefore, my use of beauty in the art work is subversive, because I am not seeking to provide pleasure; I have sought, instead, to generate a sense of anguish due to the loss of these plants. 
 
 My investigative work draws associations with the art of Andy Warhol, Gregory Pryor, Janet Laurence, Fiona Hall and Christian Boltanski. Significant aspects of their work are discussed in relation to issues that I have examined in my art, including extinction, beauty and loss. 
 
 Theories that examine the idea of beauty, including the reasons why it matters to us and how it affects us are explored. I argue that in the presence of beauty we can be moved to critical reflection. Such aesthetic and cognitive judgements surrounding beauty may lead to a greater awareness of the human impact on the natural environment. 
 
 The project makes a contribution to the field of visual art through the theoretical examination of beauty in the context of contemporary arts practice.

 Representations of the body are central to contemporary art practice. Yet there are cogent arguments coming from feminist cultural theory that, in general women's bodies, and particularly the nude, cannot be portrayed other than through forms of representation that expose them to the male gaze. This poses a significant problem for women artists wishing to employ imagery of the female body. The project has explored alternative ways of depicting the female body; ways, which disrupt ocular-centric forms of representation that privilege the spectator by posing the body as displayed object. 
 
 The following observations provided the background for this project: within contemporary approaches to representing the female body there is a marked shift away from the figuration of the external body; its depiction occurs less frequently within two-dimensional media; and, its prepositions tend to be of a less subjective nature. The project has sought to redress these shortfalls by seeking to re-vision the female body in two-dimensional painting and print-media. It has investigated alternatives to the symbolic body, enshrined within conventional pictures of female nudes, through explorations into embodied subjectivity - the specificities of lived, female experiences. Pictorially these impressions are representational, but the tactile dimensions of imagery, suggested through material surface quality, evoke a palpable sensuality that disrupts stereotypical patterns of looking. The relationship between tactility and the sense of touch dissolves the psychological and physical distance between the viewer and the picture. Pictorially, the representational framework varied from fragmented and cropped imagery of the female torso to direct illusionistic representations of the whole body.
 
 The outcomes of the research project, in the form of digital prints produced within the final phase, were chosen for exhibition. Initial investigations required the plasticity of paint media to convey the materiality of the imagery but advances, within both digital image layering processes and printing techniques resulted in a shift towards digital prints as principal output. The exhibition is, however, inclusive of key works, both prints and paintings, illuminating major developmental points encountered in the course of the project.

It comprised extensive plankton sampling together with measurements of physical parameters, between October 2001 and November 2002, including three 24-hour sampling sessions in the lower estuary to ascertain the effect of tidal currents in the transport of fishes. The Tamar was classified as a partially mixed estuary (Type 2a), based on salinity distribution, current velocities and freshwater flow. The weak vertical temperature and salinity stratification, together with strong mean current velocities (2 m/s), indicated a lack of two-layered circulation, and hence absence of a net upstream flow along the bottom. The study yielded 80,837 larval fishes representing 44 families, with catches dominated by gobiids, blenniids, clinids and engraulids. Temperature was found to be the most important variable driving temporal changes in zooplankton biomass and larval concentrations. Peaks in zooplankton biomass and larval concentrations occurred simultaneously in November, both in 2001 and 2002, at temperatures approx. 15 C, and lasted approx.2 months. Results suggest that the commencement and intensity of spawning in the Tamar may be triggered by changes in abiotic factors, such as increasing temperature and moderate freshwater flow, whereas spawning duration may be linked to biotic factors such as the presence of potential predators and food availability. No evident pattern in the spatial distribution, both of zooplankton biomass and larval fishes was observed during the peak abundance period. The spatial structuring of the larval assemblage was driven by salinity, with one assemblage representing mostly estuarine-spawned larvae (mouth to 35 km upstream), and the other representing larvae of freshwater taxa (&gt;35 km). The geographical extent of each assemblage could be associated with the strong diffusive forces of tidal currents, which also affected zooplankton biomass. An estuarine transport model used to investigate fish movements along the lower estuary was able to accurately predict concentrations of virtual larvae early in the season, as they behaved similar to passive particles. However, it was unable to accurately predict concentrations later in the season, likely because most larvae were displaying a behaviour different to passive particles due to increased swimming ability. Strategies likely helping retention and survival of larvae in the Tamar Estuary include a short (approx.months), defined occurrence period that is well-timed with zooplankton production, and location where these larvae are spawned within the estuary.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">270500 Zoology</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/1092</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/1092/1/01Front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/1092/2/02Chapter_1.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/1092/3/03Chapter2.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/1092/4/04Chapter_3.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/1092/5/05Chapter_4.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/1092/6/06Chapter_5.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/1092/7/07Chapter_6.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/1092/8/08Chapter_7.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/1092/9/09Apendix.pdf</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Space and Sexuality in the Post-Victorian Fiction of Sarah Waters</field><field name="creator">Hall, DM</field><field name="description">This thesis analyses the work of British writer Sarah Waters, focussing on the inseparability of spatiality and the expression of sexuality in her novels. Since 1998, Waters has published three books set in the mid-to-late Victorian era, featuring lesbian protagonists: Tipping the Velvet, Affinity and Fingersmith. All three novels are examples of lesbian fiction, but they are also arguably works of historiographic metafiction and post-Victorian novels. They have been critically and popularly acclaimed, added to university reading lists and adapted for television. There has thus far been a small amount of scholarship in response to Waters' novels, primarily concerned with generic classification and lesbian identity.
 The entwined discourses of space and sexuality form the theoretical basis of this discussion. There is a large body of academic work on this subject, by cultural theorists such as Michel Foucault, Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick and Mark Wigley as well as geographers such as Tim Creswell. Previous studies of Waters' work have made little use of theories of space and sexuality, despite their relevance to her novels. I draw upon these theories in my analyses of Tipping the Velvet, Affinity and Fingersmith, exploring the way in which the historically transgressive sexualities of Waters'heroines are constructed spatially, via the characters' movement (or lack thereof) through confining interiors. 
 
 Chapter One looks at the ways in which theatrical and performative transgressions affect sexual expression in Waters' first novel, Tipping the Velvet. Sites of performance, or stages, are not only located in theatres in this text, but are present everywhere: on the streets and in the homes of both the rich and poor. Upon these numerous and diverse stages Nancy Astley, the protagonist of the novel, reveals the inherent performativity of gender and sexuality through cross-dressing and impersonation. The second chapter shows the way sexual identities are confined within both the private sphere and the prison in Affinity. The desires of the protagonists can be articulated only through spiritual or ghostly transgressions, which are simultaneously arousing and frightening. The third chapter focuses on domestic spaces and madness in Fingersmith. Waters draws on Victorian notions of hysteria and female sexuality in this novel, re-appropriating them for her own purposes. This thesis concludes that Waters re-presents Victorian sexuality through the spaces in which it was enclosed.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">420201 British and Irish</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/1096</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/1096/1/01Front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/1096/2/02Whole.pdf</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Assessment and management of inherent and dynamic soil properties for intensive agriculture in the North Island, New Zealand and Tasmania, Australia</field><field name="creator">Cotching, WE</field><field name="description">The primary aim of the research reviewed in this thesis has been to provide information required by land managers on inherent and dynamic soil properties for sustainable intensive agriculture. A soil survey in the Te Puke district, New Zealand, found the soils to be young with the majority having a layer of tephra in their profiles which gives rise to low overall nutrient status and free draining properties. Soils in north west Tasmania were found to be predominantly Red Ferrosols formed on basalt. The Ferrosols are characteristically strongly structured, strongly acid and have high organic carbon contents. The Ferrosols surveyed were being managed at their optimum land capability or better, with little evidence of soil degradation.  The importance of taking a morphological approach to the studies of soil health is illustrated by comparing data from similar paddock histories across the soil orders studied. The differences in physical properties and soil carbon contents between soil orders were pronounced. The measured effects of cropping on soils varied depending on inherent differences between the soils studied. Soil carbon levels were found to be falling with increased years of cropping on all soils studied. Strong correlations were found between soil carbon and a range of soil physical, chemical and biological properties. Target levels of soil carbon are suggested for cropping systems, which can be used as an indicator of sustainability. The soil properties and paddock variables found to be significantly correlated with crop yield varied, depending on crop and soil type. Two easily applied measures of soil structure were correlated to crop production on heavier textured soils.  Research into the off-site effects of agriculture in north west Tasmania found that there were high levels of water turbidity caused by soil erosion from cropped paddocks and high levels of nutrients emanating from dairy pastures on drained lowland areas.  There has been a positive change in farmer perceptions and soil management practices over a ten-year period in north west Tasmania. Several information brochures have been published for farmers to assess and manage their soils for sustainable production. The research undertaken and reviewed here has produced information on inherent and dynamic soil properties required by farmers for sustainable intensive agriculture. The work has played a major role in the understanding of how soil management has an impact both on and off site and in influencing soil management on farms in both Tasmania and the Bay of Plenty, New Zealand</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">300100 Soil and Water Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/1097</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/1097/1/01Front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/1097/2/02Whole.pdf</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Littera pro uerbis: Epistolarity, Ethnography and the Author's Persona in Ovid's Epistulae ex Ponto</field><field name="creator">Alexis, F</field><field name="description">The aim of my thesis is to extend the current discussions of ethnography, epistolarity and the ancient persona, to the text of Ovid's Epistulae ex Ponto. It is a particularly appropriate text to extend the ideas of literary and cultural identity and epistolarity as the poems are written as letters by an urban Roman poet who is exiled to the end of the known world. His poems reveal, in the medium he knows best, the varied responses of a sophisticated city-dwelling poet to life in the wilderness on the frontiers of the Roman Empire. I argue that the poet describes his unfamiliar situation by using terms and traditions 'known' or familiar to his readers to illustrate his 'unknown' place of exile. In this thesis, I look at how the poet uses well known ethnographical stereotypes and the letter form, both to illustrate his unfamiliar location in exile in an understandable way, and to blur the distinction between the author as an historical person in a specific geographical location and one who is a literary persona constructed along with poetic geographical and anthropological detail.  Although many scholars have written on the subject of Ovid's exile poetry, few have looked at the epistolarity or the letter form of these last poems from exile. I show in this thesis that the Epistulae ex Ponto is a text that repays scrutiny in this light because the poet draws comparisons and writes about his situation in exile using the recognisable literary form of letters. I also show how the poet's increased use of his name, Naso, affects our perception of the persona in the Epistulae ex Ponto. I argue that in these last poems from exile the persona is indistinct as the poet can now only identify himself using letters instead of the spoken word. I show how the poet blends the personal and private sphere of the epistolary genre with the public nature of published elegiac verse, using the names of well known Roman citizens in an attempt to strengthen his appeal for help and support from specific individuals. I conclude that the poems in the Epistulae ex Ponto should be read with the poet's exile firmly in mind. Exile necessitates the use of letters in place of spoken words, so an awareness of literary devices, such as ethnographic stereotypes, epistolarity and emphasis on the author and recipient of these letters rather than on constructed personae, enhances our pleasure and understanding of these poems sent from exile.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">420205 Latin and Classical Greek</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/1098</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/1098/1/01Front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/1098/2/02Whole.pdf</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Problems with Nature - Sculptural Installation and the Culture/Nature Paradox.</field><field name="creator">Bond, I</field><field name="description">This research project investigates visual metaphors for aspects of the nature/ culture paradox. Modern human beings formalise nature, natural elements and natural processes by quantifying and qualifying the environment to better define themselves. A desire to comprehend and gain control over nature is expressed through the imposition of artificial systems and mathematical descriptions. However, the forces of entropy and decay are ever present. Despite attempts to suppress these physical processes, humans are necessarily bound to a common material existence. In response, attainment of a spiritual dimension is sought through cultural expression.    The project explores how the nature/ culture paradox is manifested in the phenomenon of landscape design, especially formal gardens of 18th century Europe, including features such as Platonic forms, labyrinths, mazes and meanders. Particular attention is given to the work of Batty Langley. The investigation is located within an international field of artists concerned with the culture/ nature  question.  The enquiry considers artists who create visual representations of symbolic pathways, such as Jorgen Thordrup and Marianne Ewaldt. Land and environment art is examined with regard to concepts of order, disorder, entropy and stasis, emphasizing those artists such as Robert Smithson, Nancy Holt and Jurg Altherr, who contrast artificial constructions with natural settings. It also considers the appropriation of nature in a search for the sublime through the sculptural installations of Anja Gallaccio.    Examination of formal garden features has informed new hybrid motifs which are developed in the work for this project. The application of these designs to the sculptural and installation mediums has involved innovative usage of materials and techniques. The development of a personal symbology to present metaphors for order and chaos/ entropy and stasis, has produced new juxtapositions of man made forms and natural elements. Exploration of the viewer's engagement with space and physical ambience, including smells, has also been an important element of the work. In addition, new methods have been developed to visualise concepts through computer generated virtual drawings and, to present the preparation and exhibition of sculptural installations through digital photography. Finally, the project considers the spiritual dimension within human culture, employing a number of universal symbols in new ways to create works, which echo both eastern and western sensibilities, for example, metaphorical methods for attainment and links between Buddhist and alchemical symbolism.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">410200 Visual Arts and Crafts</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/1120</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/1120/1/01ContentsIntro.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/1120/2/02Chapter1.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/1120/3/03Chapter2.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/1120/4/04Chapter3.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/1120/5/ConcAppendRef.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/1120/6/02Full.pdf</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Evaluation of the Effectiveness of the Business Simulation Course at Payap University</field><field name="creator">Sae Lee, S</field><field name="description">Recent educational reform in Thailand has recognised the importance of a student- centred approach to learning. This change of emphasis reflects a global trend to  prepare high level graduates who can meet the present and future needs of  communities in general and of business in particular. By meeting the challenges  presented by globalisation, Thai universities can grow and thrive in a new economic  era, which is characterised by constant  change and ever-increasing educational  demands. Courses which prepare students to meet the practical demands of the  workplace are being introduced in universities worldwide. To test whether  experiential learning is practicable in a university learning environment, a Business  Simulation Course (BSC) at Payap University was evaluated. The course is intended  to facilitate business students' learning, by integrating theory with practice, which  involves students working in 'real-life' business contexts.      The study data were collected from  three sample groups of stakeholders.  Stakeholders sampled included: BSC students, staff members at Payap University  and non-university respondents who included villager leaders, parents of students,  suppliers and policy-makers. Eighty respondents were surveyed by questionnaire,  and 20 respondents were interviewed. The data were collected during the second  semester of the 2003 academic year. Quantitative and qualitative analyses of the data  were undertaken, in addition to a review  of relevant literature. In this study, a  'grounded theory' approach used the modified 'Constant Comparative Method' as a  means of both data collection and data analysis (Strauss &amp; Corbin, 1998b).      The findings of the study indicated that the course is an effective means of linking  theory with practice by experiential learning. Stakeholders expressed the view that  practical courses such as the BSC helped students to develop critical thinking and  problem-solving skills and gave them the necessary experience to work co- operatively in a 'real' business world. However, non-university stakeholders were  more in agreement with this point than students and staff. The data also indicated that  students tended to prefer classroom learning by case study to learning-by-doing in a  'bona fide' business setting. The reasons given for this were that stress levels were  higher for students in experiential learning, largely due to the extra demands on their  time and the added pressure of teamwork. In addition, increased resourcing of the  course was seen as necessary to produce more effective teaching and learning  outcomes in the BSC. The data also indicated that stakeholders believed that working  in the community context is an important focus of the university because each  institution is part of a unique local community. Also, all stakeholders recognised that  business ethics are an important aspect of business life, which should be incorporated  in the curriculum. However, students, staff and non-university stakeholders all  agreed that learning in a simulated business environment is useful for future  employment, because it allows students to experience 'real-life' business problems  and develop solutions to them.      Thus the study provides valuable feedback from stakeholders in the BSC. This is  useful as part of the process of improving curriculum design as it closes the loop between purpose - implementation - review of the course. This feedback enables  faculty staff at Payap University  responsible for curriculum design and  implementation to refine their activities in courses such as the BSC. Feedback is also  provided in the term of useful practical and theoretical advice to the university  sector. Finally, policy-makers senior bureaucrats and high level administrators in  government will also benefit from the insights provided by this study.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">330000 Education</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/1136</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/1136/1/01Front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/1136/2/02Whole.pdf</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The beautiful, durable and mundane: exploring notions of value in craft and design practice, in the context of sustainability</field><field name="creator">Skinner, RJ</field><field name="description">The project addresses issues of value and meaning in objects while at the same time considering more sustainable approaches to designing, making and consuming, through the reuse of already existing materials. By exploring concepts such as durability and ephemerality, the precious and the mundane, I have sought to show possibilities for reconciling the production of objects with reduced environmental effects of their production, use and disposal. This was an issue that tended to be neglected during the period of modernist design with its embracing of technology and the machine aesthetic. Since the 1960's with the emergence of designers and writers such as Victor Papanek and Buckminster Fuller there has been a growing concern to develop more sustainable approaches to design, and a broader consideration of meaning and engagement with objects. Some of the significant contemporary designers addressing these issues include Paolo Ulian, Hella Jongerius and Constantin and Laurene Boym. It is with reference to this field that I contextualise my practice. 
 
 Through the research project I have recognised the importance of a local focus, in supporting more sustainable approaches and engagement with objects. In the process I have identified factors specific to designing with reuse materials, and have used them to guide the direction of the research. These include: material availability, perceived value of materials, time or cost required to achieve a high finish, design complexity and sophistication, and perceived value of the finished product. What has also emerged from the research is the importance of commercial considerations in designing for sustainability, as I believe economically viable objects contribute more than purely symbolic ones in influencing the perceptions and habits of designers and consumers. The project has shown that engagement with objects and sustainable approaches, when considered as integral to a design's development, can be mutually beneficial and lead to aesthetically sophisticated and highly valued objects.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">410200 Visual Arts and Crafts</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/1183</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/1183/1/01Front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/1183/2/02Whole.pdf</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reading Matters: An Examination of Plurality of Meaning in Selected Indonesian Fiction, 1980-1995</field><field name="creator">Allen, PM</field><field name="description">Using the work of theorists in the field of reader-response theory, this thesis examines the notion that the meaning of a given literary work is a product of the interaction between the reader and the text, and that a given work thus potentially contains a plurality of valid meanings.

While post-colonial theory has exposed the ideological structures and material practices which position indigenous peoples as "other" to the colonisers, most scholars have remained curiously silent when it comes to nonhumans. Animals now stand as the ultimate "other", denied a subjective life of their own, for their behaviour is usually read, as Helen Tiffin argues, "as having primary (and exclusive) significance for humans."  The project of this thesis is to examine the narratives within which Australians have "trapped" their dingoes. My methodology takes as its starting point Foucault's theories which connect discourse and power. The thesis is divided into three sections; Colonial Discourses, Aboriginal Dreaming and Contemporary Configurations. The colonial section asks how discourse forces the dingo to represent human fears and failings. I argue that a denigrating discourse is used to justify the ill treatment of the dingo, that discourse reveals little about the "real" dingo, and that there are similarities in the discursive treatment of dingoes and Aborigines. The thesis also acknowledges the dingo's attempts to slip through the gaps in the discourse "fence".  The second section researches traditional Aboriginal myths of the Dreaming Dingo. By encouraging the dingo to trot back to happier times, I allow the reader to step back also and assess Aboriginal representations of the dingo, arguing that these are based on an empirical knowledge of its habits and nature.  I contend that in contrast to a colonial discourse based on difference, the Aboriginal narratives assume similarities to animals and the potential for crossovers. This section argues that a pragmatic Dreaming Dingo teaches humans to live harmoniously and cautiously in an environment which is both nurturing and dangerous.  Finally the dingo returns to the trail and trots into a place where practical knowledge of wilderness is negligible. The contemporary section of this thesis argues that in their longing to claim the dingo and its wildness for their emotional and spiritual needs, urban Australians generate a confused, incompatible and ignorant mix of colonial and Dreaming Discourse. The dingo in the National Park is required to carry an impossible discourse and it fails - biting the hands which feed it. "Bringing the Dingo Home" reflects an exciting time as one more "other' breaks "the deafening silence" described by Wolch and Emel, and demands a position in post-colonial discourse. At last the discourse of the dingo can be foregrounded and its misrepresentations can be redressed.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">420300 Cultural Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/1196</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/1196/1/01Front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/1196/2/02Whole.pdf</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Chemical treatment of backsawn Tasmanian Oak with Polyethylene Glycol (PEG) prior to drying</field><field name="creator">Ralph, J</field><field name="description">A series of experiments was conducted with the view of obtaining baseline information on the use of polyethylene glycol (PEG) on Tasmanian Oak for the purpose of improving the quality of the seasoned structural timber product. Tasmanian Oak is the marketing name for a triad of Tasmanian-grown eucalypt species (E. delegatensis, E. obliqua, and E. regnans). Incubation of freshly-milled timber in aqueous PEG solutions prior to seasoning follows on from investigations in northern hemispheric timber species such as hoop pine and spruce in the middle of the 20th Century. PEG penetrates freshly sawn Tasmanian Oak in a manner which is considerate of incubation time, temperature, PEG molecular weight/size and timber density. Histological examination indicated that PEG penetrated completely throughout the structure of the wood substance in three orientations (transverse, radial and tangential). During air-drying of PEG soaked timber, further migration of PEG into Tasmanian Oak is negligible. The rate of moisture content loss in Tasmanian Oak was shown to be retarded by PEG pre-treatment although the ability to prevent moisture loss was not concomitant with dimensional stability. An investigation to explain the change in rate of moisture loss examined effects on the thermodynamic property, water activity. Results indicated that a change in solution water activity could partly expain changes in the rate of moisture content loss, but more research is required to better divine this relationship. Shrinkage in Tasmanian Oak was reduced after treatment with aqueous PEG 400 solutions at or above 30% (v/v), with a greater percentage reduction in tangential shrinkage compared to reduction in radial shrinkage. This is significant as backsawn (a.k.a. flatsawn) timber, with its broader tangential face, was in particular focus. The reduction in shrinkage was consistent with PEG concentration in the incubating medium. A decrease in the formation of drying defect, such as surface and internal checking accompanied the improvement in keeping sawn dimensions. Backsawn Tasmanian Oak obtained from young trees (less than 20 years) from plantation resource presents a challenging profile for commercial timber drying and will become more prevalent as the logging of old-growth forests is phased out. Timber seasoners may be faced with options of longer drying times or lower yields due to drying defect unless a method can be developed to provide added protection to the sawn timber product during drying. At this stage, pre-treatment of Tasmanian Oak with PEG shows the hallmarks of providing a solution to this emerging dilemma.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">270402 Plant Physiology</field><field name="subject">270400 Botany</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/1222</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/1222/1/JRalphthesis_front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/1222/2/JRalphthesis_complete.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/1222/3/JRalphAppendix1.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/1222/4/JRalphAppendix2_1.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/1222/5/JRalphAppendix2_2.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/1222/6/JRalphAppendix2_3.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/1222/7/JRalphAppendix3.pdf</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ecology and conservation of ground-dwelling beetles in managed wet eucalypt forest: edge and riparian effects</field><field name="creator">Baker, SC</field><field name="description">Limited understanding of the ecology of ground-dwelling invertebrates in Tasmania has hampered our ability to assess the adequacy of forest management. This thesis documents the distributions of ground-dwelling beetle assemblages in managed, wet eucalypt forests of southern Tasmania, and explores the response of beetles to ecological gradients caused by riparian influences near small streams (since retained riparian corridors are a major conservation tool), and edge effects from recently clearfelled logging coupes. Extensive pitfall trapping using replicated transects at four sites was employed to compare the beetle fauna between five habitats: young logging regeneration, the interior of upslope mature forest, the riparian-upslope transition in mature forest interior, and across coupe edges (both into upslope mature forest and into streamside reserves). Data screening ensured that the primary transect design, which employed traps positioned at unequal distances within transects, was unlikely to produce patterning in beetle distributions attributable to spatial autocorrelation or pitfall trap depletion. Beetles responded to riparian influences, showing subtle shifts in assemblage composition, and generally reduced abundance or species richness nearer to streams. However, site differences outweighed riparian effects. Beetles assemblage composition differed substantially between young logging regeneration and mature forest: several species were identified as indicators of each habitat. Beetles responded more strongly to edge effects than to riparian influences. Depth of edge influence extended ~ 22 m into unlogged non-riparian forest, but further into streamside reserve edges (up to ~ 65 m). Four beetle species, Choleva TFIC sp 01 (Leiodidae), Decilaus nigronotatus, D. lateralis and D. striatus (all Curculionidae), were indicators of mature forest interior. A second survey compared beetles between logging regeneration, upslope mature forest interior, mature forest interior riparian areas, and streamside reserves that had been logged on both sides, in five stands of each of the four habitats. Streamside reserves (average width 40 +/-6 m (+/- 95% CI) from reserve edge to stream) supported different beetle assemblages to unlogged areas, and were probably entirely edge-effected. These results suggest that current corridor provisions, which rely heavily on riparian reserves, may be inadequate to conserve beetles dependent on mature forest interior. Reserve corridors may need to be wider, and should more often be positioned upslope away from riparian areas. Alternatively, a mix of different types of reservation strategies (e.g. conserving some contiguous blocks of mature forest in lieu of widened corridors) needs to be developed to increase the probability that edge-sensitive and mature forest specialist taxa will be conserved.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">270504 Invertebrate Biology</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/1256</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/1256/1/01Front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/1256/2/02Whole.pdf</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Surviving Port Arthur : the role of dissociation in the impact of psychological trauma and its implications for the process of recovery</field><field name="creator">Watchorn, JH</field><field name="description">Psychological  trauma results from exposure to an inescapable stressor  that overwhelms  a person's  ability to cope.  During the period of perceived threat a  defensive process of denial and suppression frequently operates to  control  a person's  emotional response to the situation.  Emergency services personnel in particular, may actively employ a task-  oriented approach to traumatic incidents: and suppress their anxiety and  fear in order to maintain concentration  and undertake their duties most effectively.  In psychological terms, this behaviour may be seen as purposeful, adaptive dissociation.   However, recent studies of emergency services personnel reveal that there are possible long-term risks associated with the experiencing dissociation  during a traumatic situation. While the ability to control emotional response may be viewed as an effective way  of coping during an intense or traumatic situation, there is an inherent danger that this inhibition of emotions may become the source of long term psychological and physiological disturbance.   Psychological  debriefing is a popular method of assistance for emergency services personnel following a traumatic incident.  It is designed to promote the cognitive and emotional processing of a traumatic event.  During a debrief,  participants describe the traumatic experience (including their reactions and emotions) in order to begin to  integrate and master key features of the experience.   While there is abundant anecdotal evidence suggesting that psychological  debriefings can be beneficial, there have also been conflicting reports as to their actual effectiveness. Investigators have indicated that rigorous  investigation of the effectiveness of psychological  debriefing and its role in post-trauma recovery is urgently  required.  In  particular, such investigations need to provide a clear answer to the  question 'Is psychological  debriefing related to the prevention of PTSD  symptoms and associated psychological sequelae?'      In this study, an investigation was undertaken of 96 emergency services  personnel  involved in the response to the 'Port Arthur massacre', a critical incident  in which a lone gunman randomly killed 32 visitors in a popular tourist  venue in southern Tasmania. All participants were individually interviewed on two occasions: eight  months after and twenty months after the incident.  Two key findings from  the research project we presented.  Firstly, experiencing dissociative symptoms at the time of the incident was predictive of long-term psychological  and physiological distress. Secondly, within the group of emergency services personnel who experienced  dissociation at the event, those who disclosed their related thoughts and  feelings at the subsequent group debriefings showed significantly less  long-term psychological distress. The results of this study offer insight into how the impact of biological  chances caused  by a traumatic event can be modified by the psychological processing of  that event.  The results support the suggestion that following a traumatic situation, a person needs to process and integrate the memory of that event if he or she is to 'recover'   from his or her reaction to the situation.  Psychological debriefing  appears to provide an opportunity for the necessary psychological processing to commence and assist emergency  services personnel in managing what might otherwise develop into PTSD.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">380100 Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/1271</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/1271/1/01Front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/1271/2/02Whole.pdf</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Deformity as Device in the Twentieth-Century Australian Novel</field><field name="creator">Cranston, CA</field><field name="description">This study is based on several assumptions: it recognises that the person who is deformed has an existence both in the world and in the novel; it recognises that in both the world and the novel the deformed-being has borne a negative
 stigma. It also recognises that a literature reflects its culture, as must the characters  who  exist  within  that  literature.  As  Harry  Heseltine  states succinctly: 'No writer invents his metaphors ex  nihilo; in the long run he finds them  somewhere in  the range of  possibility that  his culture makes available  to  him'.  This  study  asks:  can  that  most  marginalised  of  all characters, the deformed-being, provide any revelations about the self, about the novel, the reader of the novel, and the culture within which all exist?  The answer in each case is an unequivocal yes. Each chapter is devoted to a particular character in a major Australian novel; comparisons are made with other literary works, Australian and non- Australian. The individual chapters reveal the metaphors and symbolism attached to the character's particular deformity, and demonstrate how the deformed body informs the body of the text. The whole study presents an overall picture of  deformity as  a fairly consistent and  an  often-utilised metaphor. Chapter One provides a general survey of deformity as a metaphor. Chapter  Two  looks  at  Louis  Stone's  Jonah   (1911),  in   which   the hunchbacked  larrikin  character  is  a  post-colonial  interpretation  of  the traditionally conjoined outcast states, deformity and criminality. In Chapter Three  the  dwarf Jackie in  Ruth  Park's  Swords  and  Crowns  and  Rings (1977) is seen as a metaphor for non-conformity during a time when Australia was signalling a resistance to the Old-World moulding. Chapter Four is also concerned with the post-colonial identity as revealed through the dwarf and half-caste Billy Kwan  in  C.  J.  Koch's The  Year of  Living  Dangerously (1978); it questions an identity that is 'imposed', whether at a national or individual level. In Chapter Five the relationship of the hunchbacked dwarf Rhoda Courtney with  her adopted brother, the  artist Duffield, in Patrick White's  The  Vivisector  (1970) places  deformity  in  the  tradition  of  the kunstlerroman.  In Chapter Six, Koch's The Doubleman (1985) is shown to combine elements of the  kunstlerroman while raising questions about the post-colonial identity through the dualities arising out of the doppelganger: spiritual, bodily, and cultural displacement are all focussed by the device of Richard Miller's lameness. Chapter Seven moves from deformity that is congenital or disease-originated, to disability or deformity that is human- caused (either by negligence or intervention), thus allowing a discussion of the importance of the etiology of deformity as a device: in Thea Astley's The Acolyte  (1972) Jack Holberg's blindness is caused by  fly-strike.  Chapter Eight examines the use of terror evoked through archetypal evolution of the lame crone Hester Harper in Elizabeth Jolley's The Well (1985). In Chapter Nine  the  crypto-dwarf Arthur  Blackberry  in  James  McQueenls Hook's Mountain  (1982) is portrayed with  the accompanying baggage of dwarf mythology; his implicit demise raises questions about our responses towards the deformed. Chapter Ten is a literary history of eugenics, as seen primarily through Eleanor Dark's Prelude to Christopher (1934) and Christina Stead's The Man Who Loved Children (1940). The conclusion discusses the initial, problems of dealing with a taboo topic, along with reasons for excluding autobiographicaltreatments of deformity, biographical portrayals, war novels, and children's literature. Finally, Leslie Fiedler's comment that deformity is the reigning metaphor  of our  age is  shown  to  be  particularly apt  in  an Australian context.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">420202 Australian and New Zealand</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/1393</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/1393/1/01Front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/1393/2/02Chapter1.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/1393/3/03Chapter2.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/1393/4/04Chapter3.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/1393/5/05Chapter4.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/1393/6/06Chapter5.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/1393/7/07Chapter6-7.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/1393/8/08Chapter8-9.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/1393/9/09Chapter10Onwards.pdf</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The responsibility to protect : no more Rwandas : the international community and humanitarian intervention in the 21st century</field><field name="creator">Potter, DW</field><field name="description">Humanitarian intervention lies at the fault-line in international relations between the principles of international law and state sovereignty (pluralism) on the one hand, and morality and the protection of human rights (solidarism) on the other. Whereas the pluralist international-society theory defines humanitarian intervention as a violation of the cardinal rules of order, it is being challenged by the solidarist view, that seeks to strengthen the legitimacy of the international community by developing its commitment to justice. As a result, a solidarist international community is one in which states accept a moral responsibility to protect the security, not only of their own citizens, but of humanity everywhere. 
 The humanitarian tragedies in Somalia, Rwanda and Srebrenica in the 1990s and in Darfur currently, have highlighted to the international community the need for the notion of sovereignty to be re-defined, to permit intervention in support of the emerging norm of the responsibility to protect.  In the 21st century, a state that violates the fundamental norms of human rights by failing to provide for the safety, security and well-being of its citizens creates a legal and moral burden on the international community to act. 
 This dissertation contends that the international community has a legal and moral responsibility to intervene to prevent humanitarian emergencies.  To test the veracity of this thesis, it was assessed against a number of case studies that span India's intervention into East Pakistan in 1971 to the ongoing crisis in Darfur in 2006. While many aspects of humanitarian intervention remain contentious this dissertation found that there is a trend towards the solidarist approach that is reflected in the emerging international norm of the "responsibility to protect". Further, it confirmed that the most successful interventions involve a range of actors, usually, the United Nations and/or a regional organisation, backed by a hegemonic power. Finally, it found that a successful humanitarian intervention is dependent upon the international community's commitment to understanding the gravity of the situation at hand and, if necessary, confronting the Westphalian tradition of sovereignty, to provide the appropriate institutional support and resources, and the political will to mobilise that capacity in the face of other priorities and preoccupations.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">390111 International Law</field><field name="subject">370103 Race and Ethnic Relations</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/1418</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/1418/1/potter-front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/1418/2/potter-whole.pdf</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigation of meteorological events preserved in high resolution snow pit and fin core records</field><field name="creator">McMorrow, AJ</field><field name="description">A key problem in ice core palaeclimate studies is the interpretation of the various measurable parameters in ice in terms of climate and environmental conditions. This study is aimed at developing a closer understanding of the connection between high resolution snow/firn measurements and meteorological conditions. Ultra high resolution snow pit and shallow firn core records of oxygen isotope ratios (del18O) and a suite of trace chemical species including marine biogenic sulphur compounds (methane sulphonate (MSA), non-sea salt sulphate), nitrate and major sea salt ions (sodium, chloride, magnesium), were generated at a high accumulation site on Law Dome, East Antarctica. Concordance between accumulation events identified in the records up to 7.7 km apart confirms that the observed chemical and isotopic variations are the result of regional rather than local surface effects. This allows calibration of the snow pit and firn core records with measured meteorological parameters. Event scale dating of the records was established using hourly snow accumulation measurements from a co-located automatic weather station (AWS). The ultra high resolution nature of this study and independent dating scale provide an opportunity to examine exact timings in the seasonality of each chemical species. The traditional summermaximum species of del18O and MSA show consistent relative phasing during mid-summer over four annual cycles. Nitrate shows an erratic seasonal cycle with a general trend characterised by narrow peaks during spring and early summer, preceding the mid-summer peaks in del18O and MSA. Non-sea salt sulphate cycles indicate similar characteristics to MSA signals during summer, but are more comparable to nitrate signals during spring, autumn and winter. This suggests the summer non-sea salt sulphate signal is driven by biological activity, yet appears to be linked with nitrate signals outside the summer season. Finally, the sea salt species indicate a seasonal cycle characterised by maximum concentrations during autumn, winter and spring. Event scale dating of the snow pit and firn core records allows direct comparisons between the chemical and isotopic signals and observed meteorological conditions. Local meteorological conditions recorded by the AWS are combined with synoptic scale meteorology derived from Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer satellite imagery and back trajectory analysis to identify potential source regions and transport mechanisms influencing the chemical and isotopic signals. Potential source regions and transport mechanisms are examined for the marine biogenic indicators (MSA, non-sea salt sulphate). Results indicate that the seasonal variation in marine biogenic activity is reflected in the Law Dome records, and the sea ice zone provides an important source region. However, results also indicate that lower latitudes, and the Heard Island region (50 degrees S, 70 degrees E) in particular, may provide an important additional source region for MSA and non-sea salt sulphate outside the summer season. High sea salt signals are generally associated with intense cyclonic systems, yet variations in atmospheric circulation and transport mechanisms also impact on the sea salt record. Comparisons between del18O signals and local air temperatures reveal the del18O record is an excellent proxy for temperature at Law Dome, although high (warm) del18O events are found to be influenced by atmospheric circulation and associated with rapid advection of air from low latitudes. Finally, results suggest that spring nitrate signals at Law Dome may be linked to the intrusion of stratospheric air through the breakdown in the polar vortex during spring.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">260601 Meteorology</field><field name="subject">260402 Chemical Oceanography</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/1426</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/1426/1/am_front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/1426/2/am_whole.pdf</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effect of specific dietary constituents on coronary heart disease risk factors</field><field name="creator">Ahuja, KDK</field><field name="description">Diet influences the coronary heart disease (CHD) risk factors including lipids and lipoproteins, glucose, insulin, and endothelial function. This research thesis examined the effects of the three different (tomato-olive oil combination and chilli) but widely consumed dietary components, on a range of metabolic and vascular parameters of CHD risk.
 
 The aims of this thesis were to investigate the effects of:
 o	a lycopene (tomato)-rich high monounsaturated fat (light olive oil) diet and a lycopene-rich high carbohydrate diet (each diet of 10 days duration) on serum lycopene, lipid profile and serum oxidation in 21 men and women aged between 22 and 70 years with a BMI of 18 - 30kg/m2.
 o	a chilli blend (30g/day) supplemented diet and a bland (chilli free) diet (each diet of four week duration) on a range of metabolic and vascular parameters in 36 men and women aged between 22 and 70 years with a BMI of 18 - 35kg/m2. The measured parameters included serum lipids and lipoproteins, lipid oxidation, glucose, insulin, basal metabolic rate (BMR), heart rate (HR), peripheral and aortic blood pressure, augmentation index (AIx; a measure of arterial stiffness) and subendocardial viability ratio (SEVR; an indicator of myocardial perfusion).
 o	single meals containing chilli blend (30g) with or without the background of a chilli-containing diet on a range of postprandial metabolic and vascular parameters (n = 36). 
 o	a chilli blend supplemented diet (of three weeks duration) on endothelial-independent and -dependent vasodilation (assessed after administration of glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) and salbutamol, respectively) compared to the effects of a bland diet (n = 15).
 o	the active ingredient of spices (in different concentrations) including chilli (capsaicin and its analogue dihydrocapsaicin), turmeric (curcumin), piprine (black pepper) and the colour pigment of tomatoes (lycopene) on the in vitro copper-induced oxidation of serum lipids.
 
 The dietary intervention studies were conducted using a randomized crossover design on a weight maintenance regime. Two different groups of people volunteered to take part in the tomato-olive oil and the chilli studies. All participants from the four week chilli study also took part in the meal studies. 
 
 Ten days of a high lycopene monounsaturated fat rich and high lycopene carbohydrate rich diets presented similar increase in serum lycopene concentration and a similar reduction in serum total and LDL cholesterol. 
 
 The AIx after three weeks of regular chilli consumption was lower on the chilli diet compared to the bland diet, but there was no significant difference in the overall effects of GTN and salbutamol on endothelium-independent and -dependent vasodilation between the two diets. Four weeks of iso-energetic weight maintenance chilli and bland diets produced no significant differences in serum lipids, glucose, insulin, peripheral and central blood pressure, AIx, SEVR or BMR. HR was lower after four weeks of chilli-supplemented diet in men, but not in women. Serum collected after the chilli-supplemented diet exhibited a lower rate of copper-induced oxidation compared to the serum after the bland diet. Women, but not men, also showed a longer lag phase after the chilli-supplemented diet compared to the bland diet. This was probably due to the higher chilli/capsaicin and dihydrocapsaicin intake (per kg body weight) in women. In vitro studies with capsaicin, dihydrocapsaicin (and curcumin) also exhibited a concentration effect for the resistance to copper-induced serum lipid oxidation. 
 Results of the meal tests were surprising and exciting. The CAB meal (chilli-containing meal after the bland diet, eaten on day 29 of the bland diet) and the CAC meal (chilli-containing meal after the chilli diet, eaten on day 29 of the chilli diet) showed a lower maximum increase in postprandial serum insulin and overall postprandial serum insulin response compared to the BAB meal (bland meal after the bland diet, eaten on day 22 of the bland diet). The probable reason for this ameliorated insulin profile was a small reduction in insulin secretion and a large increase in the hepatic insulin clearance. The correlation between insulin and SEVR indicated an increase in the myocardial perfusion after the CAC meal compared to the BAB meal. All these results were more pronounced after the CAC meal and in people with BMI greater than 26kg/m2. Contrary to popular belief and some previously published data, we did not observe a significantly higher energy expenditure (EE) after the CAB meal or the CAC meal compared to the BAB meal. In fact, a lower EE was observed in people with increased BMI on the CAC meal compared to the BAB meal. This effect was possibly the consequence of improved postprandial insulin profile and reduced sympathetic nervous system activity after the CAC meal. 
 
 The results from these investigations may have significance in improving serum lycopene concentrations, lipid profile (tomatoes and olive oil), postprandial insulin response (chilli) and increased resistance of serum to copper induced oxidation (chilli) and hence decreasing the risk of CHD, especially in people with increased BMI for whom the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality is higher than in lean individuals. Together, the results from these studies not only advance our knowledge relating to the relationship between some foods and the CHD risk factors but provide an opportunity to combine olive oil, tomatoes and chillies with other foods and spices (as often used in curries) in an attempt to further investigate foods and cuisines that will minimise the various risk factors for CHD.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321200 Public Health and Health Services</field><field name="subject">321205 Nutrition and Dietetics</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/1428</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/1428/1/thesis_front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/1428/2/Chapter1_Background_and_Aims.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/1428/3/Chapter_2.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/1428/4/Chapter_3.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/1428/5/Chapter_4.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/1428/6/Chapter_5.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/1428/7/Chapter_6.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/1428/8/Chapter_7.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/1428/9/Chapter_8__general_discussion-conclusion.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/1428/10/Reference_list_appendices.pdf</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Monstrous Encounter</field><field name="creator">Kirsopp, E</field><field name="description">This research project proposes that the monstrous encounter in art, film and story can signify the change from the understood to the unknown self, using the historical context and literary elements of Little Red Riding Hood as a framework. Within this framework three visual artists, Kiki Smith, Jazmina Cininas and Matthew Barney are investigated to demonstrate how the monstrous encounter signifies the change from the understood                                             to the unknown self. In order to use Little Red Riding Hood as a framework the historical context of the tale has been broken down into three periods, identified as the original, the bourgeois and the contemporary. In each period it is shown how the monstrous encounter signifies the change from the understood to the unknown self. The research project draws on the work of Jack Zipes, The Trials and Tribulations of Little Red Riding Hood (1993) and Fairy Tales and the Art of Subversion (1983); Jon Elster, The Multiple Self (1985); Barbara Creed, The Monstrous Feminine (1993) and Phallic Panic (2005); and Julia Kristeva, Powers of Horror (1982). These key references are used to define important ideas and strengthen terminology specific to the project, such as self, monster and monstrous encounter, abjection and transformation. As a result of using Little Red Riding Hood as a framework the majority of the research looks at the monstrous encounter almost exclusively in the form of lycanthropy, which lends itself most easily to concepts of metamorphoses and the div   ided self. The werewolf enjoys enormous popularity in many avenues of contemporary culture and there exists countless references to this particular genre of monstrous encounter. However, this is not a project about werewolves but an investigation of the monstrous encounter, whatever form it takes. Whether it is an internal event like the work of Matthew Barney or an external process as in Cininas's use of Angela Carter's contemporary Red Riding Hood, the monstrous encounter in art, film and story can be demonstrated to signify the change from the understood to the unknown self.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">419999 The Arts not elsewhere classified</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/1430</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/1430/2/front_master_thesis.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/1430/3/emma_kirsopp_master_thesis-whole.pdf</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Developing student's understandings and representations of statistical covariation</field><field name="creator">Moritz, J</field><field name="description">Statistical covariation refers to the correspondence of variation of two statistical measures that vary along numerical scales. Reasoning about covariation commonly involves translation processes among three representations: (1) numerical data, (2) graphical representations, and (3) verbal statements such as "taller people tend to be heavier". Two well-known translations are graph production and graph interpretation. Less well known is the process of speculative data generation, involving translating a verbal statement into a possible graph or other data representation. This study explored school students' reasoning involving these three translation skills through various tasks in surveys and interviews. Evidence is presented concerning methods to assess these skills, and concerning how students as young as third-grade can engage covariation tasks involving familiar contexts. Interviews involved prompting for cognitive conflict using responses from other students, and provided evidence of limited engagement of ideas that were slightly more sophisticated than their own responses. Responses for each of the three translation skills were described within assessment frameworks involving four levels - Nonstatistical, Single Statistical Aspect, Inadequate Covariation, and Appropriate Covariation - distinguished by the structure of combining correspondence and variation. Distinguishing features of the levels suggested stages of development that may inform instruction. For development from prior beliefs to data-based judgements, tasks involving counterintuitive covariation were designed to prompt students to engage data. For development from single variables to bivariate data, time was observed as a natural covariate, implicit in statements such as "it's getting hotter", with a connotation of order that supported pattern recognition of passing time being associated with corresponding change in a measured variable. For development from single cases to global trends, many students represented correspondence in a single pair of values, at the expense of representing variation. Tasks involving discrete data with few cases, and the use of case labels in responses, were observed to support the view of two data values each linked to the same corresponding case label. This consolidated view of correspondence supported consideration of additional bivariate cases involving variation. Students tended to articulate covariation using the language of comparison and change. Findings were related to issues in the historical development of coordinate graphing, to findings from educational research in statistics, algebra, science and psychology, and to recommendations within curriculum documents. Student representations of statistical covariation were observed to provide a window into statistical reasoning, and are advocated as a valuable basis for classroom discussions to help develop statistical literacy.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">330109 Assessment and Evaluation</field><field name="subject">330100 Education Studies</field><field name="subject">330202 Curriculum Studies - Mathematics Education</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/1473</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/1473/1/jm-Front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/1473/2/jm-Whole.pdf</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Glucose uptake in skeletal muscle</field><field name="creator">Kolka, CM</field><field name="description">Glucose uptake occurs in skeletal muscle under basal conditions, and increases in response to stimuli such as insulin and exercise.

Here we study factors affecting both basal and stimulated myocyte glucose uptake, with a particular focus on vasoactive agents.
 
 Insulin stimulates the release of endothelin-1 (ET-1), a potent vasoconstrictor, from endothelial cells in culture. As yet it is unknown whether ET-1 is a type A (causing nutritive perfusion) or a type B (non-nutritive) vasoconstrictor, so here we use the pump-perfused rat hindlimb to characterize the distribution effects of ET-1.  We show that ET-1 causes a type A vasoconstriction, stimulating basal metabolism at low doses, while at high doses the distribution of flow changes to become non-nutritive, inhibitory to metabolism.  As a general vasodilator prevents both metabolic and hemodynamic effects, the effects on metabolism are due to the redistribution of flow.  These redistribution effects are confirmed by the ability of high dose ET-1 to decrease aerobic tension development in the contracting hindlimb, and by the ability of low dose ET-1 to increase the interstitial glucose concentration.
 
 Given this understanding of the effects of ET-1 alone, we can investigate the interactions between ET-1 and insulin.  In the perfused rat hindlimb, insulin has not been observed to have any vasodilatory effect, whereas here for the first time insulin appears to have vasodilator-like actions against ET-1 mediated vasoconstriction.  Also, the redistribution of flow by ET-1 does not appear to alter the metabolic effect of insulin to cause glucose uptake at either dose of ET-1 used.  
 
 Nitric Oxide (NO) is thought to be the mechanism by which insulin causes vasodilation in muscle.  A previous study has shown that methacholine (MC), by increasing NO, was able to augment insulin-mediated glucose uptake and capillary recruitment, while other NO donors were unable to do so.  Here we show that, at the dose used to increase glucose uptake in the previous study, MC has only a vasodilatory effect, and no direct effect on glucose uptake, in the perfused rat hindlimb.  At higher doses, an effect on glucose uptake can be observed.  This means that the increase in capillary recruitment by MC was responsible for the elevated insulin-mediated glucose uptake, and there was no direct effect of MC on glucose uptake.  
 
 A recent publication suggested that the Na+-D-glucose cotransporter (SGLT1) was essential for insulin-mediated glucose uptake, although not required for basal glucose uptake.  The implications of this detract from our proposed role of blood flow redistribution in insulin action.  In attempting to reproduce these results in the perfused rat hindlimb we found that SGLT1 is not required for insulin-mediated glucose uptake, and confirmed this using a low sodium buffer, which would also inhibit the transporter.  We conclude that SGLT1 is not required for insulin-mediated glucose uptake.
 
 Our results therefore suggest that complex interactions are involved in insulin action, some of which involve hemodynamic actions that are capable of altering insulin-mediated glucose uptake, and others in which insulin itself can limit the action of other vasomodulators, such as ET-1.  It is apparent, however that SGLT1 in the endothelium may not be necessary for the metabolic effects of insulin, and that blood flow distribution, or capillary recruitment is therefore of great importance in delivering glucose to myocytes.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">320300 Medical Biochemistry and Clinical Chemistry</field><field name="subject">320307 Medical Biochemistry - Other</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/1577</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/1577/1/KolkaFront.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/1577/2/KolkaWhole.pdf</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Aspects of the biology and ecology of six temperate reef fishes (families: Labridae and Monacanthidae).</field><field name="creator">Barrett, NS</field><field name="description">The currently most accepted population theory for reef fish was developed on tropical reefs and suggests that populations of most reef fish species are limited primarily by recruitment, with little post-recruitment resource limitation. I tested the validity of this theory for temperate reef fishes by examining growth rates in six common species from a number of isolated populations for evidence of resource limitation. If resources are limiting, spatial and temporal variation in recruitment and mortality should lead to isolated populations experiencing differing levels of resource availability, particularly food availability, which will be reflected in growth rates. I worked with six of the most common reef fishes found in Tasmanian waters so that any findings would form the basis of a broadly applicable model. These were Notolabrus tetricus, Notolabrus fucicola, Pictilabrus laticlavius, Pseudolabrus psittaculus, Penicipelta vittiger, and Meuschenia australis. Before examining growth rates it was first necessary to define the scale at which populations could be considered to be isolated. The short and long-term movement patterns of each species were studied using visual observations to interpret short-term patterns, and recaptures of tagged fish to interpret the long-term patterns.  Methods of ageing each species were developed and validated, with growth rates of tagged fish being used to validate the use of otoliths for ageing. General growth curves are presented.  For most of the species, there was some uncertainty in current texts about the sexual system used and the relationship between sex and dichromatism and dimorphism. To clarify this situation the reproductive biology of each species was examined. The relationship between sex and growth rate was also examined.  For two species (N. tetricus and N. fucicola) annual growth data from tagged fish were obtained over a 3-4 year period, allowing inter-annual growth variability to be examined. As well as providing an insight into the variability of growth with time, these results also aid in the interpretation of growth curves determined from otolith ageing.  In all species investigated, no significant differences in growth rates were detected between populations occupying similar habitats and subject to similar environmental conditions. These results suggest that post-recruitment resource limitation in the form of food limitation may not be an important factor influencing the post recruitment growth and survival of many temperate reef fishes with pelagic larval stages. This agrees with the assumptions made, but rarely tested, in current theories concerning the regulation of populations of reef fish, particularly those on temperate reefs.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">270702 Marine and Estuarine Ecology (incl.

The district was an important gold mining
 centre in the 1800's and produced up to 1 million ounces of gold, mostly from deep
 leads. Re-mapping of the area has resulted in a major revision to the stratigraphy and
 structural knowledge of the area. Significant changes include the recognition of the
 formerly known Early Devonian Burranah Formation as a Late Ordovician volcanic
 unit with significant exploration potential for Au-Cu mineralization. Also recognised is a Late Silurian shelf sequence with potential for Au-Cu and base metals overlying the Burranah Formation.
 
 The Burranah Formation is a dominantly submarine, volcano-sedimentary succession
 with a complex internal stratigraphy. Two main lithofacies associations can be
 recognised on the magnetic images. A lower package, composed mostly of primary
 volcanic rocks and minor volcaniclastics is overlain by a package composed dominantly of volcaniclastics and sediments. Small elongate intrusive bodies occur throughout the sequence.
 
 Structural interpretation of the area reveals one dominant D2 deformation (Early
 Carboniferous) that produced meridional to northwest-trending folds, cleavage, thrust
 faults and oblique-slip faults. A zone of higher strain is developed within the Burranah Formation and is characterised by overturned, tight, F2 folds and considerable shortening.
 
 Mapping and interpretation of the area has been greatly assisted by the availability of
 high resolution gravity, magnetic and radiometric data. The interpretation of magnetic
 data has considerably enhanced the structural interpretation.
 
 Volcanic and intrusive rocks of the Burranah Formation comprise a coherent calcalkaline suite with a dominantly shoshonitic character. In MORB-normalized plots, they display patterns typical of many modern subduction-related volcanics with a marked depletion of Ta and Nb and similar or lower abundances of the heavy REE and Ti. Positive &#949;Nd values indicate a mantle source for the shoshonites with little or no crustal contamination.
 
 Primary gold mineralization in the district occurs in veins and as disseminations in the
 structurally more competent rocks adjacent to faults and shear zones in the higher
 strain zone. Host rocks are generally intrusive monzodiorites, diorites or coherent
 volcanics and range in age from Late Ordovician to Early Devonian. Sulphur and lead
 isotope data support a syndeformational model for mineralization with fluids and gold
 derived from the host rock sequence.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">260101 Mineralogy and Crystallography</field><field name="subject">260100 Geology</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/3043</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/3043/1/1_front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/3043/2/2_intro.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/3043/3/3_regional-geological-setting.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/3043/4/4_geophysics.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/3043/5/5_geochemistry.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/3043/6/6_mineralization.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/3043/7/7_conclusion-refs.pdf</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Spatial uncertainty estimation techniques for shallow coastal seabed mapping.</field><field name="creator">Lucieer, VL</field><field name="description">Techniques for seabed habitat mapping have developed considerably over the past 10 years, principally through advances in acoustic technologies and tools for improved spatial analysis. The increasing need for information on the distribution and structure of seabed habitats in coastal waters (&lt; 50 m deep) has developed in Australia due to increasing pressures from development and exploitation.
 A clear understanding of the uncertainties in creating spatial information from marine data is required within seabed mapping projects, particularly those using acoustic methods that vary in coverage and resolution.
 This thesis investigates methods to explore spatial uncertainty in the techniques used to characterise shallow water seabed habitats using local and regional scale case studies ranging from interpolation of sediment cores to classifying digital elevation models generated from multi-beam acoustic data. Uncertainties are investigated in a multidiscipliary approach to habitat mapping. Broad-scale
 and fine-scale mapping of marine seabed habitats can provide considerable information on patterns of physical seafloor structuring and this is now achievable given recent technological advances in echosounders and backscatter analysis, digital underwater video, differential GPS and Geographic Information Systems
 (GIS).
 The uncertainties in classifying single beam acoustic data are examined by comparing data visually classified into habitat classes in real time compared to those defined through post-processing in the laboratory. The influence of a range of transect spacings on qualitative knowledge-based interpolation of shallow rocky reef acoustic data is assessed. Parameters of physical reef characteristics
 from single beam acoustic data are investigated which aid in improving kriging interpolation techniques.
 A fuzzy classification method is applied to sediment core data collected over 100s of kms in order to map the distribution of unconsolidated sediments. This
 technique is tested on Australia's SeaScapes data. The SeaScapes layer was recreated with classes derived from an unsupervised fuzzy clustering algorithm.
 A sensitivity analysis was performed which explores the optimal number of clusters and clearly shows where classes overlap, highlighting confusion and therefore potential classification errors in the data. Conditional simulation was utilised to explore uncertainty in the interpolated data layers and animations produced which provided an advanced way of visualising the surfaces.
 Image segmentation techniques are applied at various values of splitting and merging thresholds to identify objects in sidescan sonar imagery. Grey Level Co-occurrence Matrices (GLCM) texture measures are integrated with segmentation
 to identify homogeneous texture regions in an image. The segmentation and object oriented classification provide good classification results in 10-40 m water depth with accuracy values of &gt;80 % when classifying two classes and &gt;60% when classifying three classes. This section of research focuses on the analysis of seabed habitats through the use of algorithmic calculations at multiple scales
 to quantitatively delineate distinct seabed regions based on texture parameters. The textural characteristics of three habitat classes are explored and tested onsidescan sonar data in two case studies. Segmentation results are validated using underwater video transects and statistical techniques. The classified sidescan acoustic images are spatially characterised using fragmentation statistics. These results are a leap forward providing a methodology and a terminology to describe the distribution of shallow rocky reef, combined with a classified map and 
 an uncertainty map generated by the object oriented technique.
 
 Fuzzy classification techniques are used to characterise the two dimensional structure of shallow rocky reefs from multi-beam bathymetric data. The results from two morphometric classification techniques are contrasted and compared. Many physical and biological processes acting on the seabed are highly correlated with bathymetric features, such as ridges and channels. Examples of these 
 include the selection of habitat by many commercially fished species, such as rock lobster, abalone and reef associated fish species. These physical attributes
 can therefore often be key predictors of habitat uitability, community composition and species distribution and abundance. These methods greatly improve insight into classification and related uncertainties of morphometric classification.
 
 There are many potential applications of seabed habitat mapping for which estimates of uncertainty will provide additional crucial information. As habitat mapping becomes more common in Australian coastal waters and datasets
 build up over time, compatibility between different sets of information will be essential. Monitoring and change detection analysis requires detailed baseline
 data with uncertainty estimates to ensure that features that display change are reliably detected. The accuracy of marine habitat maps and their associated levels of uncertainty are extremely hard to convey visually or to quantify with existing methodologies. The new techniques developed in this research provide a rigorous alternative to current practices. The methods used in this research
 integrate existing techniques in a novel way to improve insight into classification and related uncertainty for seabed habitat maps which will progress and improve resource management for Australian coastal waters.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">269901 Physical Geography</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/1919</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/1919/1/Lucieer_front_matter.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/1919/2/Lucieer_Utas_EPRINTS.pdf</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Uncertainties in Segmentation and their Visualisation</field><field name="creator">Lucieer, A</field><field name="description">This thesis focuses on uncertainties in remotely sensed image segmentation and their visualisation.

 A Comparative Study on Australian and Canadian Data</field><field name="creator">Blacklow, P</field><field name="description">This thesis examines and compares the nature, magnitude and movement in the inequality of income and expenditure of Australian households from 1975-76 to 1998-99 and Canadian households from 1978 to 1992.  The inequality of welfare impacts on an individual&#8217;s feelings of belonging and participation in society and the level of social division within it.  It may have such tangible effects as political unrest and increased crime.  This raises the issue of, what is happening to the inequality of welfare and how to measure household welfare and inequality?
	The thesis considers the normative judgements made in measuring the inequality, desirable properties of inequality indices and the appropriate variable to represent household welfare.  It finds in favour of expenditure as a more appropriate measure of a household&#8217;s living standards than income and that equivalence scales and cost of living indices should be used to account for variation in household composition and prices.
 The majority of past studies of Australian and Canadian inequality report an increase in income inequality throughout the latter half of the 20th century.  However, the timing and size of increase is dependent upon the inequality indices, equivalence scales and sample selection used in each study.  While many studies have focussed on the distribution of income, few have considered the inequality of expenditure or the explicit role of prices in inequality movements via a cost of living index.  The thesis specifies a demographically extended complete demand system and uses household survey and price data to obtain estimates of its parameters to construct and compare alternate equivalence scales and demographically varying cost of living indices.
 The independence of the equivalence scale to reference utility was found not to hold suggesting that welfare comparisons between households of varying demographic types will be dependent on the specification of the household cost function.  While the estimated price elasticities vary significantly across households, prices of commodity groups have moved such that the change in the cost of living over time is relatively uniform across households.
 The thesis finds that the real adult equivalent disposable income inequality of households has been rising in Australia consistently from 1975-76 to 1998-99, while real adult equivalent expenditure inequality recorded a fall over the period as a whole.  In contrast, the inequality of Canadian household real adult equivalent disposable income and expenditure, have moved together, rising from 1978 to 1986 before falling in 1992.  Australia has a higher magnitude of inequality in the distribution of household equivalent expenditure compared to Canada.  The decline in the inequality of accommodation expenditure has been significant for Australia and Canada in offsetting the rise in inequality of expenditure on food and alcohol and tobacco.  The rise in wage inequality and to a lesser extent investment income inequality, have largely accounted for the rise in gross income inequality in both countries.
 The thesis finds that the movement in Australian inequality is not overly sensitive to equivalence scale specification, although Engel, OECD and per capita scaled welfare tend to exaggerate the movement when compared to demand system based scales.  In Canada from 1982 to 1986 changes in household composition resulted in significant difference in the movement of inequality estimates for different equivalence scales.  The Engel, OECD and per capita based estimates showed a fall in inequality in contrast to the demand system based scales.  The magnitude and the movement in inequality for both countries are insensitive to the specification of price indices.  Excluding observations from the original sample can have extreme consequences on the reported magnitude and trend in inequality.
	By exploiting the additive decomposability property of inequality, the employment status and education level of the household head for Australia and Canada respectively, were found to have a large effect on the magnitude and movement in inequality.  Age of the household head and the demographic type of the household were found to explain less than a sixth of the magnitude and trend in household inequality for both Australia and Canada.
	To summarise, this thesis makes the following contributions:
 Methodological 
 
 i)	It considers the normative judgements made in measuring inequality, the desirable properties of inequality indices and the appropriate variable to use to represent household welfare.
 
 ii)	It accounts for differences amongst the demographic composition of households by using equivalence scales based upon an explicitly defined demographic extended demand system.
 
 iii)	It accounts for price movements by developing a cost of living index based upon an explicitly defined demographic household cost function and complete demand system.
 
 Empirical
 
 i)	Real adult equivalent disposable income inequality of households has been rising in Australia consistently from 1975-76 to 1998-99, while real adult equivalent expenditure inequality recorded a fall over the period as a whole.
 
 ii)	In contrast Canadian household real adult equivalent disposable income and expenditure inequality have moved together, rising from 1978 to 1986 before falling in 1992.
 
 iii)	The movement in Australian and Canadian inequality is not overly sensitive to different demand system based scales but Engel, OECD and per capita scaled estimates tend to exaggerate the movement of Australian inequality and report movements in Canadian inequality from 1982-1986 reverse to the demand system based scales.
 
 iv)	The magnitude and the movement in inequality for both countries are not very sensitive to the specification of price indices.  However there is evidence that regional price movements in Canada have helped to offset inequality, while allowing for differing price impacts across households using the CLI reduces this effect.  For Australia price movements appear to have reduced the fall in expenditure inequality and increased the rise in income inequality slightly.
 
 v)	Excluding observations from the original sample can have extreme consequences on the reported magnitude and trend in inequality.
 
 vi)	Employment status and education level of the household head for Australia and Canada respectively, were found to have a large effect on the magnitude and movement in inequality.  Greater than, what could be explained by decomposing by age of the household head or the demographic type of the household.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">340210 Welfare Economics</field><field name="subject">340404 Cross-Sectional Analysis</field><field name="subject">340101 Microeconomic Theory</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/2037</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/2037/2/blacklow-front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/2037/3/blacklow.pdf</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The influence of feminism

The massive sulfide
 ore deposits occur in a felsic volcanic and sedimentary succession (VS Complex) of late
 Famennian (Upper Devonian) to late Visean (Middle Carboniferous) age. Volcanic facies
 analysis has been carried out on three areas in Portugal, including the Neves Corvo mine, and
 five sections in Spain. In all sections studied, the depositional setting during accumulation of the
 VS Complex was submarine and below wave base.
 The principal felsic volcanic facies are: (1) coherent rhyolite and dacite, associated with
 monomictic breccia; (2) fiamme-rich breccia (with variable amounts of dense volcanic and
 sedimentary clasts), fiamme-rich sandstone and fiamme-bearing mudstone; and (3) crystal-rich
 sandstone and mudstone. Mafic units are minor, dominated by coherent facies and have
 uncertain mode of emplacement (intrusions or lavas). Fiamme typically have lenticular shape
 and quartz- or quartz- and feldspar-phyric texture, and are interpreted to be altered and
 compacted pumice clasts. The volcanic facies are typically interleaved with, and regionally less
 voluminous than, the non-volcanic facies, which are dominated by mudstone.
 The felsic volcanic facies are interpreted to be the products of numerous, relatively small
 intrabasinal volcanic centres that generated abundant lavas, domes and pyroclastic units. Some
 volcanic centres are dominated by lavas, whereas others have similar proportions of lavas and
 pyroclastic units. The domes and lavas are more voluminous but less laterally extensive than the
 pyroclastic units. A sediment-matrix breccia typically occurs at the top contact of the felsic
 lavas with sedimentary units. This sediment-matrix breccia formed from the infiltration of fine
 sediment into interclast spaces in previously formed hyaloclastite, and could be misinterpreted
 as peperite. Felsic intrusions are less voluminous than lavas, and were emplaced as cryptodomes
 and partly extrusive cryptodomes, late in the evolution of the VS Complex. The architecture of
 the different study areas reflects differences in the eruption style, emplacement processes and
 proximity to source. Parts of the succession interpreted to be proximal are dominated by thick
 lavas/domes and intrusions, and coarse pyroclastic deposits. Medial parts comprise
 resedimented autoclastic facies derived from the lavas and domes, and relatively thin pyroclastic
 units. Distal parts comprise relatively thinly bedded crystal-rich sandstone and siliceous
 mudstone. Regional correlations in the VS Complex are impossible, as none of the volcanic
 facies are regionally extensive and each of the volcanic centres has a unique internal
 architecture.
 At Neves Corvo mine, the massive sulfide ore deposits are close to one of the felsic volcanic
 centre(s), occurring immediately above the rhyolitic lavas/domes.

 Relevance: A Behavioural and ERP Investigation
 of Affective Picture Processing</field><field name="creator">Briggs, KE</field><field name="description">ERP evidence of affective picture processing generally agrees with one of two dominant
 theories. The first is that enhanced ERP responses to pleasant and unpleasant stimuli
 relative to neutral reflects the processing of stimulus motivational relevance, referred to
 as the quadratic effect, and the second is that enhanced ERP responses to unpleasant
 stimuli compared to pleasant and neutral stimuli reflects a negativity bias. The
 overarching aims of the current series of empirical studies were to identify which of the
 two aforementioned theories can most definitively account for affective picture
 processing (Phase 1); and to investigate how processes of attentional engagement and
 disengagement are influenced by the presence of motivationally relevant stimuli (Phase
 2). Pictorial affective stimuli (high and low arousing pleasant, unpleasant, sexual, and
 neutral stimuli) were presented in a modified oddball paradigm to 38 participants (19
 male, 19 female) in Experiment 1 and 34 participants (17 male, 17 female) in Experiment
 2. A negativity bias was demonstrated for P3b amplitude in Experiment 1; however
 significantly enhanced P3b amplitudes evoked in response to sexually explicit stimuli in
 Experiment 2 was not consistent with either dominant theory, and raised questions as to
 the separable effects of motivational relevance and sexual arousal on cognitive processes.
 Experiment 3 was aimed at investigating whether ERP responses are differentially
 modulated by the social content of affective picture stimuli. The same participants from
 Experiment 2 participated in Experiment 3 and the oddball task involved the presentation
 of low arousing social and non-social pleasant, unpleasant, and neutral stimuli. No
 significant differences in ERP component measures were shown between social and nonsocial
 pleasant, or between social and non-social unpleasant stimuli, however both P2 and
 P3b component amplitudes were enhanced in response to neutral faces compared with
 neutral objects. Factors associated with facial recognition and difficulties extracting
 affective information from a somewhat ambiguous neutral expression were cited as
 possible explanations for the observed ERP component modulations.
 The principal aim of Phase 2 was to investigate whether the presentation of
 appetitive and aversive cues influences the engagement and disengagement components
 of covert visual attention as inferred by responses to validly and invalidly cued targets
 respectively. Participants in Experiment 4 @=I9 female) and Experiment 5 @=I8
 female) were presented with a modified peripheral cueing paradigm, where pictorial
 stimuli (sexual, mutilation, threatening, and neutral) served as peripheral cues. Target
 processing as indexed by P1 and P3b amplitude showed significant facilitation in both
 Experiments 4 and 5 when targets were cued by sexual and mutilation stimuli, regardless
 of whether cueing was valid or invalid. It was therefore concluded that the engagement
 and disengagement components of covert visual attention are not differentially affected
 by motivationally relevant cues; rather, normal participants demonstrate a global
 response bias when respondmg to targets that are cued by motivationally relevant
 appetitive and aversive cues. The same participants from Experiment 5 were presented
 with a peripheral cueing paradigm in Experiment 6, which aimed to investigate the effect
 of phylogenetically (biological) and ontogenetically (cultural) fear-relevant stimuli on
 processes of covert visual attention. Pictorial stimuli depicting dangerous animals, human
 threat, and neutral objects served as peripheral cues. In line with preparedness theory
 (Seligman 1970, 1971), target processing was facilitated by the presence of animal threat
 stimuli compared to human threat and neutral stimuli, and also the early level of visual
 processing as indexed by cue-evoked P 1 amplitude was enhanced in response to
 phylogenetically, fear-relevant animal stimuli. A global response bias was again
 demonstrated in Experiment 6, and it was concluded that the attentional system of normal
 participants is sensitive to stimuli that have been evolutionarily associated with threat
 and/or fear. The current dissertation therefore has theoretical implications for the
 systematic study of affective picture processing. Furthermore, the introduction of a
 peripheral cueing paradigm to the study of affective picture processing provides a new
 insight into the effect that both appetitive and aversive stimuli have on processes of
 attentional orienting and target processing.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">380100 Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/2277</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/2277/1/01front_Kbriggs.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/2277/2/02whole_kbriggs.pdf</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">On Long-Term Climate Studies Using a
 Coupled General Circulation Model</field><field name="creator">Phipps, SJ</field><field name="description">Coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation models are the simplest models which
 are capable of simulating both the variability which occurs within each component
 of the climate system, and the variability which arises from the interactions between
 them. Only recently has it become computationally feasible to use coupled general
 circulation models to study climate variability and change on timescales of O(104)
 years and longer. Flux adjustments are often employed to maintain a control climate
 that is both stable and realistic; however, the magnitude of the adjustments
 represents a source of concern.
 This study employs the CSIRO Mk3L climate system model, a low-resolution
 coupled atmosphere-sea ice-ocean general circulation model. The atmospheric and
 oceanic components are spun up independently; the resulting atmospheric simulation
 is realistic, while the deep ocean is too cold, too fresh and too buoyant. The
 spin-up runs provide the initial conditions for the coupled model, which is used to
 conduct a 1400-year control simulation for pre-industrial conditions. After some
 initial adjustment, the simulated climate experiences minimal drift. The dominant
 mode of internal variability is found to exhibit the same spatial structure and correlations
 as the observed El Ni&#732;no-Southern Oscillation phenomenon.
 The ability of Mk3L to simulate the climate of the mid-Holocene is evaluated. It
 correctly simulates increased summer temperatures at northern mid-latitudes, and
 cooling in the tropics. However, it is unable to capture some of the regional-scale
 features of the mid-Holocene climate, with the precipitation over northern Africa
 being deficient. The model simulates a 13% reduction in the strength of El Ni&#732;no,
 a much smaller decrease than that implied by the palaeoclimate record.
 A 1400-year transient simulation is then conducted, in which the atmospheric
 CO2 concentration is stabilised at three times the pre-industrial value. The transient
 simulation exhibits a reduction in the rate of North Atlantic Deep Water formation,
 followed by its gradual recovery, and a cessation of Antarctic Bottom Water formation.
 The global-mean surface air temperature warms 2.7&#9702;C upon a trebling of
 CO2, and 5.3&#9702;C by the end of the simulation.
 A number of modifications to the spin-up procedure for the ocean model are
 evaluated. A phase shift in the prescribed sea surface temperatures and salinities is
 found to reduce the phase lag between the model and observations, and to lead to
 a reduction in the magnitude of the diagnosed flux adjustments. When this spin-up
 run is used to initialise the coupled model, the reduced flux adjustments are found
 to have negligible impact upon the nature of the internal variability. While the flux
 adjustments are not found to have any direct influence upon the response of the
 model to external forcing, they are found to have an indirect influence via their
 effect upon the rate of drift within the control simulation.
 An iterative spin-up technique is also developed, whereby the response of the
 ocean model is used to derive a set of effective surface tracers. These result in a
 much more realistic vertical density profile within the ocean. The coupled model
 exhibits slightly increased internal variability, with reduced convection within the
 ocean. There is a slightly greater surface warming in response to an increase in
 the atmospheric CO2 concentration, with the reduced convection resulting in slower
 penetration of the surface warming to depth.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">260400 Oceanography</field><field name="subject">260602 Climatology (incl.

The
 introduction describes the inception of the project in a study of writing practiceS
 among'a group of fiction writers, which identifies a process of self-transformation as
 an experience common to members of the group. Having identified this experience as
 the subject of study for a thesis,it gives a rationale for a choice of the work of
 poet and novelist Janet Frame,in that she enacts through her writing a process of 
 subjective change that embodies the self-transformation identified as integral to 
 creative practice. The introduction also signals the project of reading the work of
 Midhel de Certeau, and Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari alongside that of Frame, as
 theorists who offer approaches to understanding subjective trasformation.
 
 Chapter One places the work of Frame alongside that of the literary theorist and
 philosopher Michil de Certeau as a way of reading motivation in Frames's work. This
 chapter conducts a thematic survey of the novels' concerns with experiences of 
 subjective confinement, using Certeau's figuration of language structures as sites of
 constraint and subversion, and linking Frame's response with Certeau's ideas of
 tactics and strategies.
 
 Chapter Two surveys the work of the philosophers Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari . .
 on processes of creative thought as they relate to narratorial practices in Frame's
 novels, and relates her project to their concept of becoming, via the genre of minor
 literature. The chapter presents an argument that Frame's writing enacts a double
 becoming in that her creation of altered subjective space for herself also creates
 possibilities of collective change.
 
 Chapter Three conducts a chronological survey of Frame's novels, identifying
 structural elements and linguistic approaches to the creation of altered subjectivity in
 writing. It treats Frame's body of work a written entity characterised by an
 elaboration of the procedures and concepts through which subjective change can be
 understood. Another movement of double becoming is presented in the movement by
 which the praxis of each successive book forms'a 'theoretical" base for further praxis
 in the work that follows.
 
 Chapter Four approaches the relation of a reading/writing collective to this
 transformative theorising of subjectivity through a writing practice. The chapter  '
 begins by considering ways in which Frame gives voice to the connection of writing
 to the collective, tracing her characters' articuilation of a responsibility to speak before
 those who have been unable to do so. It goes on to consider the reflex of this. doubling
 of Frame's becoming,through responses of the collective to herwork.
 
 Chapter Five comprises a collection of poems written as part of the thesis, enacting
 and meditating on ways my own theoretical and writing practices have modified one
 another in the process of thinking and writing. The poems are also a direct response to
 Frame's work, thus forming an extension of the previous chapter's considerations of
 collectivity in reading/writing.
 
 The conclusion summarises the movement of ideas throughout the thesis using
 Frame's references to-point of view as a structuring device.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">420101 English</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/2279</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/2279/1/frontmatter.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/2279/2/ReFraming_-_Transformations_of_Subjectivity_Through_Writing.pdf</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluation and Professional Development Practices
 in Tasmanian High Schools</field><field name="creator">Kertesz, JL</field><field name="description">This study reports on teacher evaluation and professional development practices in Tasmanian
 high schools. It was conducted within a context of increasing regulation of teachers through
 legislated registration and directed standards. The thesis in this study is that there is insufficient
 linkage between teacher evaluation and professional development. The study investigates
 whether Tasmanian high schools monitor teaching, and verify whether teacher learning leads to
 explicit pedagogical outcomes.
 By considering factors such as organisational theory, teacher competence, evaluation objectives
 and approaches, and the impact of change, a list of ideal objectives and characteristics for the
 evaluation of teachers is established. By examining organisational support of new pedagogies,
 the application of stage theory to determine individual needs, and validation of training to
 ensure that learning has been applied, a similar list of ideal objectives and characteristics is
 obtained for professional development.
 A sample of 193 high school teachers was surveyed to determine the extent of teacher
 evaluation by supervisors, and independent reflective pedagogical practices. It also examined
 professional development participation, effectiveness, and satisfaction. Teacher perceptions of
 their ability to affect their performance management were analysed. The state wide survey is
 complemented by case studies of four high schools to reveal extant evaluation and professional
 development practices and attitudes. Surveys of documentation and teacher attitudes are
 supported by student focus group discussions to yield an insight into classroom realities.
 The state wide survey revealed that formal evaluation and classroom observation were
 uncommon, and that one third of the sample rarely engaged in scheduled discussions about
 pedagogy. Teacher attitudes to professional development were positive, but one in four
 teachers were dissatisfied with its management and outcomes. Surveyed teachers felt
 collectively strong and individually weak to influence extant evaluation and professional
 development practices. Only one case study school used evaluation as other than an
 intermittent selection tool, but half of the teachers in this school felt no ownership of, and
 lacked trust, in the process. Professional development choices in all case study schools were
 often based on enjoyment, and outcomes for teaching and learning were rarely validated.
 The research suggests that the establishment of evaluation or external implementation of
 teacher standards may be undermined by current professional development practices that are
 neither based on classroom needs, nor validated to ensure pedagogical outcomes. Collective
 independent utilisation of established standards methodologies by teachers themselves to
 establish reflective pedagogy could be the most effective way of enhancing teaching quality.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">330000 Education</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/2280</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/2280/1/1-Preamble.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/2280/2/2-Ch1-Introduction.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/2280/3/3-Ch2-Evaluation.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/2280/4/4-Ch3-Professional_Development.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/2280/5/5-Ch4-Tasmanian_HS_Survey_Data.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/2280/6/6-Ch5-Introdcution_to_Case_Studies.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/2280/7/7-Ch6-Case_Study_School_1.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/2280/8/8-Ch7-Case_Study_School_2.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/2280/9/9-Ch8-Case_Study_School_3.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/2280/10/10-Ch9-Case_Study_School_4.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/2280/11/11-Ch10-Standards_Developments_in_Tasmania.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/2280/12/12-Ch11-Towards_Professional_Ownership.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/2280/13/13-Bibliography.pdf</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Energetics and foraging behaviour of the Platypus Ornithorhynchus anatinus</field><field name="creator">Bethge, P</field><field name="description">In this work, behavioural field studies and metabolic studies in the laboratory were conducted to elucidate the extent of adaptation of the platypus Ornithorhynchus anatinus to its highly specialised semiaquatic lifestyle. Energy requirements of platypuses foraging, resting and walking were measured in a swim tank and on a conventional treadmill using flow-through respirometry. Foraging behaviour and activity pattern of platypuses in the wild were investigated at a sub-alpine Tasmanian lake where individuals were equipped with combined data-logger-transmitter packages measuring foraging activity or dive depth and ambient temperature. 
 
 Energy requirements while foraging in the laboratory were found to depend on water temperature, body mass and dive duration and averaged 8.48 W kg-1. Mean rate for subsurface swimming was 6.71 W kg-1. Minimum cost of transport for subsurface swimming platypuses was 1.85 J N-1m-1 at a speed of 0.4 m s-1. The metabolic rate of platypuses resting on the water surface was 3.91 W kg-1 while minimal RMR on land was 2.08 W kg-1. The metabolic rate for walking was 8.80 and 10.56 W kg-1 at speeds of 0.2 and 0.3 m s-1, respectively. Minimal cost of transport for walking was predicted to be 2.13 J N-1m-1 at a speed of 1.7 m s-1. A formula was derived, which allows prediction of power requirements of platypuses in the wild from measurements of body mass, dive duration and water temperature. 
 
 Activity patterns of platypuses in the wild were highly variable. Forty percent of the platypuses studied showed patterns, which deviated considerably from the nocturnal pattern generally reported for the species. Some animals showed diurnal rhythms while others temporarily followed the lunar cycle. Foraging trips lasted for an average of 12.4 h of continuous foraging activity per day (maximum: 29.8 hours). There were significant differences in diving behaviour between sexes and seasons. Activity levels were highest between August and November and lowest in January. 
 
 While foraging, platypuses followed a model of optimised recovery time, the optimal breathing theory. Mean dive duration was 31.3 seconds with 72 % Energetics and foraging behaviour of the platypus 6 of all dives lasting between 18 and 40 seconds. Mean surface duration was 10.1 seconds. Mean dive depth was 1.28 m with a maximum of 8.77 m. Up to 1600 dives per foraging trip with a mean of 75 dives per hour were performed. Only 15 % of all dives were found to exceed the estimated aerobic dive limit of 40 seconds indicating mainly aerobic diving in the species. Total bottom duration per day was proposed as a useful indicator of foraging efficiency and hence habitat quality in the species. 
 
 In contrast to observations made earlier in rivers, temporal separation was found to play a vital role for social organisation of platypuses in the lake system that was investigated. It is suggested that high intra-specific competition as well as limited burrow sites and a limited number of at the same time highly productive foraging locations were responsible for this observation. Mean burrow temperature in the wild was 17.5 and 14.2&#186;C in summer and winter, respectively, and was fairly constant over the platypus's resting period. In the cooler months, burrow temperature was up to 18&#186;C higher than ambient air temperature. 
 
 By combining both field and laboratory data, a time-energy budget for the platypus was created. Mean field metabolic rate was 684 kJ kg-1 day-1 and was significantly higher in the winter months. Mean food requirement was 132 g fresh matter kg-1 day-1. Feeding rates were 68 % higher in winter than in summer. 
 
 While platypuses in the swim tank were found to expend energy at only half the rate of semiaquatic eutherians of comparable body size, cost of transport at optimal speed as well as field metabolic rates were in line with findings for eutherians. These patterns suggest that locomotor efficiency of semiaquatic mammals might have reached a limit for energetic optimisation. The semiaquatic lifestyle seems to pose comparable energetic hurdles for mammals regardless of their phylogenetic origin.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">270604 Comparative Physiology</field><field name="subject">270706 Life Histories (incl.

The role of climatic events, tectonics and human
 disturbance of the landscape are examined. 
 
 A major valley aggradation, named the Syndendron alluvium, was deposited in the valley floor during the close of the last glaciation. The 15,000 &#8211; 10,000 cal yr BP period was a time of dramatic climate fluctuations and associated changes in vegetation, fluctuating between steppe and oak woodland. The Syndendron alluvial deposit is associated with significant fires in the mid and upper catchment, as
 indicated by ash layers and charcoal in soils dated from this time. Regular fires were clearly an important part of landscape modification in sediments and soil deposited
 after about 15,000 cal yrs BP. The deposition of the Syndendron alluvium may have began as early as 14,200 cal yr BP but more likely was deposited between ca 12,250
 and 9,300 cal yr BP (sites C11, C12, C13 and P37). The alluvium buries distinctive charcoal-rich paleosols dated between 14,700 and 14,200 cal yr BP (sites C6, C9 and
 C19). Debris flow deposits and slope wash from adjacent hill slopes provided the sediment source for the alluvium and slope wash has buried several distinctive late
 Pleistocene hill soils (sites C11, C12, C19). Alluvial sedimentation and hill slope erosion continued until at least 11,000 cal yrs BP, as indicated by an eroded hill soil at C11 that is buried by the aggrading Syndendron alluvium. Deposition had, however,ceased by ca. 9,300, as indicated by distinct alluvial soils that developed on the
 deposit (sites C12 and P37). Several colluvial soils dated to about 8,000 cal yr BP (C9 and C17) also cap the alluvium. The Syndendron alluvial event may in part relate
 to the arrival of humans during the climatic amelioration associated with the late glacial interstadial (Bolling-Allerod interstadials). Certainly there is increased
 burning of the catchment after about 15,000 cal yrs BP. Palaeolithic stone tools have been found in the catchment and along with others in the Grevena and Epirus regions,
 indicating humans were present. This period is also associated with colluvial soil deposition on lower slopes (sites C6 and C19). However, after about 12,250 cal yr BP
 there is a dramatic acceleration in the erosion rate and associated deposition on the valley floor and lower slopes. While fire appears to be important, a change to drier and cooler conditions, recorded in the Greenland ice cores as the Younger Dryas phase, may have caused denudation between 12,800 and 11, 600 cal yrs BP. The climate change toward wetter conditions after 10,000 cal yr BP and increasing tree cover appears to have led to a more stable landscape indicated by soil development and associated soil creep. However, there have been no Mesolithic sites identified in Grevena, and it is generally a period of low human activity in Greece. 
 
 Following the hill slope erosion and deposition of the Syndendron alluvium the catchment seems to have become relatively stable as indicated by the development of moderately deep and well structured fertile black silty clay loam soils on the Syndendron alluvium. This is also supported in the upper catchment, as soil colluvium caps the Syndendron alluvium after 10,000 cal yr BP (site C12), and the stream re-incised the alluvium before 7,500 cal yr BP (site C11). The stream incision and also the arrival of Neolithic farmers in the valley are associated with a series of landslides and debris flow deposits between 7,500 and 6,500 cal yrs BP. In the lower catchment 2 m of fine-textured alluvium buries well-developed dark soils formed on the Syndendron alluvium sometime after 9,300 cal yrs BP. The landslide deposits dating between about 7,500 and 6,500 cal yr BP in the upper catchment contain large (4 x 1 m), intact pieces of highly weathered soil similar in chemical composition to those preserved on the upper slopes and catchment divide. The renewed incision of the Syndendron alluvium may have over-steepened some slopes and triggered land sliding at this time. The large size of the landslides and paucity of charcoal within them may implicate increased seismic activity as a trigger, as occurred during the 1995 Grevena earthquake. Fault displacements have been noted in both the Tertiary bedrock and the upper Plio-Pleistocene sediments within the catchment, although no active (Holocene) fault scarps were noted. 
 
 Work in the base of the catchment indicates that the Neolithic impact was generally minor, with 1.5 m of alluvial deposition occurring between 5,900 and about 4,700 cal yrs BP. However, this alluvium was then abruptly buried by over 2 m of slope deposits derived from erosion of adjacent hills at after about 4,400 cal yrs BP. Thin,0.2m, A/C soils formed on the alluvial sediments during two stable periods each of about 500 years duration, indicating topsoils can develop rapidly in this environment.
 
 Other dark, loamy soil-like colluvial materials begin to be transported down-slope at about 5,000 through to 2,750 cal yrs BP. However, between 2,200 and 1,300 cal yr BP dark greyish-brown calcareous colluvium containing bedrock debris was deposited in depressions and gullies. This hill slope erosion and deposition was associated with the latter phase of the Sirini alluvium, which is the second major Holocene alluvial valley fill. This alluvium is dated near its base to ca. 4,150 cal yrs BP, but the major deposition occurs after 3,100 cal yr BP with 5 m of sediment being deposited after this date. At another site more than 6 m of fine-textured alluvium is deposited after 2,450 cal yrs BP. Sheep/goat vertebrae and bovine teeth (male) were located in two of the alluvial sections and suggest agricultural grazing practises were very well established after about 3,100 cal yrs BP. The Sirini alluvial deposition continues until at least 2,000 cal yr BP as indicated at one site and 1,700 cal yr BP at another. The Sirini alluvial deposition coincides with a series of colluvial deposits on the valley sides dated between 2,750 and 1,390 cal yrs BP. This Sirini alluvial filling appears to be staggered. At one site a distinct alluvial soil separates the alluvium into two phases Sirini A and Sirini B. Re-incision of the Sirini alluvium occurred sometime after about 1,700 cal yrs BP. Thin and incipient A/C soils form on the top of this alluvium supporting its youthfulness. 
 
 In the modern valley floor a very young alluvial deposit named the Leipsokouki alluvium occurs 1 - 4 m above the modern flood plain. This alluvial fill has very weakly expressed topsoil development and is largely composed of raw weakly weathered alluvium. It is dated as modern (140 + 130 cal yr BP Wk 9926) on charcoal taken from the upper fine-textured alluvium in the mid catchment, but elsewhere it contains Ottoman sherds.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">430202 Archaeology of Agricultural and Pastoral Societies</field><field name="subject">260114 Geomorphology</field><field name="subject">260104 Sedimentology</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/2346</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/2346/2/01Front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/2346/1/02Chapter1.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/2346/3/03Chapter2.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/2346/4/04Chapter3.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/2346/5/05Chapter4.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/2346/6/06Chapter5.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/2346/7/07Chapter6.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/2346/8/08Chapter7.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/2346/9/09Chapter8.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/2346/10/10Chapter9toEnd.pdf</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The development of Australia's Oceans Policy: change and stability in a policy community</field><field name="creator">Vince, J</field><field name="description">In December 1998, the Howard Government released Australia&#8217;s Oceans Policy, a major initiative focused at providing a framework for implementing integrated ecosystem based management of Australia&#8217;s vast marine domain.  This thesis utilises a policy community approach to review the processes and institutions that led to the development of Australia&#8217;s Oceans Policy.  It argues that despite significant policy change affected by both external and domestic policy drivers, a key element in shaping responses to the policy has been stability within the policy community shaped paradoxically by &#8216;offshore federalism&#8217; that has made it difficult to implement a fully integrated oceans policy.  
 
 Analysis of the development and implementation of the Australia&#8217;s Oceans Policy indicates that change to ocean related policies embodied in the policy framework have been driven by several interrelated factors.  These include debates over appropriate management of resources within and between sectoral groups; coordination of marine resource management between state and Commonwealth governments; and Commonwealth commitments to international instruments.  New institutional arrangements established by Australia&#8217;s Oceans Policy such as the National Oceans Office, National Oceans Ministerial Board, National Oceans Advisory Group and Regional Marine Plan Steering Committees, reflect a commitment towards integrated ocean management but at the same time confront the legal and jurisdictional framework established following a quarter century of &#8216;offshore federalism&#8217;.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">360201 Public Policy</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/2410</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/2410/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/2410/2/02introduction.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/2410/3/03chapter1.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/2410/4/04chapter2.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/2410/5/05chapter3.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/2410/6/06chapter4.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/2410/7/07chapter5.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/2410/8/08chapter6.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/2410/9/09chapter7.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/2410/10/10chapter8.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/2410/11/11bibliography.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/2410/12/12figure7.1.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/2410/13/13figure7.2.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/2410/14/14figure7.3.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/2410/15/15table1.5.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/2410/16/16table1.6.pdf</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The impact of selected orchard management practices on apple (Malus domestica L.) fruit quality</field><field name="creator">Bound, SA</field><field name="description">Orchard profitability and sustainability are largely dependent on the proportion of crop that can be marketed as first quality (pack-out).  While pack-out is directly related to average fruit quality, the visual components of quality, i.e. colour, size and skin finish, predominantly determine whether a premium price is achieved.  Fruit quality is the result of a complex interaction of management and environmental factors.  By understanding the impact of environment, culture, harvesting, handling and storage on fruit quality, growers should be able to improve both average quality in their crop as well as improving the proportion of fruit in the highest quality grade.
 Whilst management practices such as pruning, shading, and crop regulation methods have been widely studied as individual or isolated issues, the role of each in commercial orchard systems is less well understood.  From the literature, it was concluded that available information was conflicting in relation to the impact of practices such as pruning and chemical thinning on fruit quality, while the impact of crop load on fruit quality was often confounded by the effect of chemicals used to manage crop load.
 The impact of time and level of pruning, protection of fruit from direct sunlight, and crop regulation was studied in a series of field experiments in orchards managed to local commercial standards.  An examination of level and time of fruit thinning on a range of cultivars is included along with an assessment of two new generation blossom thinners (desiccants).  As these desiccants frequently cause varying degrees of foliar damage, the impact of various levels of simulated foliar damage on both crop load and fruit quality was assessed.  The blossom desiccant ammonium thiosulphate (ATS) showed positive effects on fruit quality with an increase in both fruit firmness and sugar content.  Potassium thiosulphate showed similar promise to ATS in terms of both fruit quality and as a method of managing crop load.  Low levels of foliar damage during the flowering period had little effect on fruit quality but, where 75% or more of the leaf surface was lost, fruit quality was affected and fruit set was reduced.  This study confirmed that loss of leaf area affects fruit quality but it also showed differences between the two cultivars studied.  
 It has been demonstrated by this study that both the degree and timing of pruning can affect crop load, fruit size, and fruit quality.  Pruning during the dormant winter period resulted in better fruit quality than when pruning was delayed until after fruit set.  Summer pruning adversely affected fruit size, sugar content and fruit skin finish.
 Both crop load and fruit size were reduced by overall shading of trees during early fruit development.  Covering individual fruit with commercial paper &#8216;apple bags&#8217; improved fruit skin finish with the effectiveness related to time of application.  The earlier in the season fruit is covered, the more likely that fruit skin damage will be prevented. 
 Early thinning had a positive effect on fruit quality, resulting in larger, firmer fruit with higher sugar levels.  Evidence also showed that early thinning caused fruit to mature earlier than later thinning.  In addition, positive relationships were demonstrated between fruit sugar content and weight, between fruit firmness and weight, and between fruit sugar content and fruit firmness.  These relationships have not been reported previously and demonstrate that early thinning is a valuable tool in improving fruit quality.
 Overall results were consistent with the established view that major aspects of fruit quality are determined in the first few weeks of development when cell division is dependent on carbohydrates derived from storage or limited current photosynthate.  This study has demonstrated that by increasing awareness of the impact of orchard management practices on fruit quality and making appropriate adjustments, the base level of fruit pack-out can be increased with minimal or no additional cost to growers.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">300302 Plant Growth and Development</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/2492</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/2492/1/Bound_thesis%5B1%5Dfront.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/2492/2/Bound_thesis%5B1%5D.pdf</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Crown Structure &amp; the Canopy Arthropod Biodiversity of 100 Year Old and Old Growth Tasmanian Eucalyptus obliqua</field><field name="creator">Bar-Ness, YD</field><field name="description">The crown structure and canopy arthropods of Eucalyptus obliqua were studied at the Warra Long Term Ecological Research Site in the wet sclerophyll forests of Southern

Despite their critical role in the economy and ecology of Tasmania, few studies have addressed the canopy arthropod biodiversity of these trees. The crown  structure was mapped by recording a vector in spherical space for every branch.  3- dimensional computer models were generated to aid in illustrating the tree maps. Sticky traps,  flight 
 intercept traps, and funnel crawl traps were placed in the crown to sample mobile arthropods. The age classes were quantifiably different in crown structure. 100 year old trees had young mature crowns of original branches. Old trees had either senescent original crowns or resprouted epicormic secondary crowns. Old trees expressed a greater variability in crown structure, and were more complex as measured by the amount of information required to display the computer image. Structural attributes such as hollows, dead tops, dead flanks, trunk fissures, burls, vascular epiphytes, snapped trunks, and litter collections were all present more often in the old trees than the 100 year old trees.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">300800 Environmental Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/2635</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/2635/2/01FrontMatterCh3.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/2635/3/02Ch4-Ch6.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/2635/1/03Ch7-Ch9.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/2635/4/04Ch10-13Refs.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/2635/5/05ChAppendndicesRefs.pdf</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Scott of the Antarctic: The Conservation of a Story</field><field name="creator">Murray, C</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the present status and enduring significance of the story &#8220;Scott of the Antarctic.&#8221; It critically reviews the story&#8217;s century-long history of 
 interpretation and, via literary analysis, considers its meaning for a contemporary audience. It argues that while Captain Robert Scott&#8217;s historic hut is being conserved as an icon of the heroic era of Antarctic exploration, the story which gives that hut its meaning is in a less satisfactory condition and is also in need of conservation. 
      In keeping with the twofold nature of its subject&#8212;a story which is based on fact&#8212;the thesis acknowledges both historiographical and literary critical perspectives. In addition, it draws on a wide range of data: manuscript letters and journals, newspaper and magazine commentary, historical monographs, biographies, literary works and film. 
      The thesis reviews recent scholarly commentary on Scott&#8217;s story and identifies a variety of shortcomings. These include the polarized nature of the discussion, heavy uncritical use of a single influential debunking biography and a concomitant neglect of earlier sources. A detailed analytical survey of the story&#8217;s interpretation, from its genesis  to the present, highlights principal 
 themes and the influence of intellectual fashions. Veneration of the central character has always been accompanied by criticism. But judgements of Scott&#8217;s 
 last expedition necessarily lack full knowledge of the circumstances, and many exhibit partisanship, faulty reasoning and the bias of hindsight. Two aspects of 
 the story that have remained surprisingly unexamined are critiqued: the saintly reputation of Lawrence Oates, and the methods and accounts of the other contender for the South Pole, Roald Amundsen. Despite some recent 
 favourable appraisals of Scott, evidence is presented that the character assassination that began in the late 1970s persists today.  
      The final part of the thesis directs attention away from judicial and historical debates, and seeks the story&#8217;s deeper resonances through literary analysis. Although the quality of Scott&#8217;s writing and the tragic nature of his story are often mentioned, they have previously received scant critical attention. Aspects of the explorer&#8217;s literary skill are examined, and comparisons explored between his story and Greek tragedy as described in Aristotle&#8217;s Poetics. The discussion locates a large part of the transhistorical meaning of &#8220;Scott of the Antarctic&#8221; in its tragic qualities, and concludes by considering how the story&#8217;s potential has been exploited in imaginative renderings.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">420200 Literature Studies</field><field name="subject">420399 Cultural Studies not elsewhere classified</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/2627</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/2627/1/01front.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/2627/2/02whole.pdf</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Transforming histories:
 The visual disclosure of contentious pasts.</field><field name="creator">Gough, J</field><field name="description">This project investigates new ways to apprehend and
 visually reconfigure aspects of concealed or disputed pasts.'
 The intention of this work is to enable a viewer to
 experience obscured or nearly forgotten narrativesnarratives
 of memory, time, absence, location and
 representation. The works utilise found and constructed
 objects and techniques from the visual arts, the museum,
 the library, the shop, the garden.
 One common methodology is the arrangement of multiple
 objects to activate a surface optically, and encourage a
 viewer to read it as a means of temporarily holding the
 objects in place. In doing so they find themselves part of
 the work. These pieces are experiments in understanding
 how viewers can travel around an artwork and in this
 process move their position back and forth, flickering
 between past and present and personal and national
 memory. Most works incorporate ideas of movement or
 stasis either technically or in the story which they may be
 partially relating to the viewer.
 This suggestion of waiting or of motion summons a viewer
 to enter into the work as a timekeeper. This is an anxious
 position where many of the materials inviting curiosity,
 and initially implying the humorous, accrue a sinister edge
 as the viewer reaches a point of understanding his/her
 caged predicament within the work. For the first time all these works will be exhibited together.
 Showing them in different locations raised considerations
 of setting both spatial and conceptual - and recent works
 have developed that are about journeying across time and
 place.
 The investigation has emerged from very personal
 considerations of the place of memory, forgetting, loss,
 denial and the potency of the past within my own family.
 Artists who have explored similar terrain, visually
 reconfiguring the marginal or the textual, include Gordon
 Bennett, Fiona Foley, Tracey Moffatt, Christian Boltanski
 and Fred Wilson.
 This project has been a journey through many stories
 across time. These have inevitably been incorporated into
 my own memory, my own life, and my own increasingly
 open narrative of deciphering self in the process of relating
 the past. Each work has been built from the outcomes of
 the last, and represents a claiming within a larger
 consideration of ways to personally invoke and involve
 nation, viewer and self in acknowledging our entangled
 histories.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">410200 Visual Arts and Crafts</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/2644</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/2644/1/Front_Transforming_Histories.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/2644/3/parts1-2.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/2644/4/part3.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/2644/5/part4.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/2644/6/part5.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/2644/7/part6-appendices.pdf</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Aboriginal Education in the Furneaux Islands (1798 - 1986) : a study of Aboriginal racial policy, curriculum and teacher/community relations, with specific reference to Cape Barren Island</field><field name="creator">Morgan, AT</field><field name="description">The Aboriginal people of Cape Barren Island and other Furneaux Islands have been selected for this historical analysis of Aboriginal education and racial policy, in order to ascertain the extent to which Tasmania has followed or diverged from the political and educational trends of other Australian States or Colonies, with respect to Aboriginal policy. It is found that Tasmania has influenced the development of Australian policies of Aboriginal repatriation, protection and segregation, and closely followed the national policies of assimilation and, to a lesser extent, integration. Yet the development of Tasmanian policy towards Aborigines and Aboriginal descendants, while clearly affected by national trends, has also been obfuscated by a prevailing belief, ideological in nature, that Tasmanian Aborigines have been extinct since 1876. The legacy of one century of supposed "extinction" is inherent in present Stale policy which, while at last recognising the right of individuals of Aboriginal descent to identify as Aboriginal, does not accord such persons the status and rights of indigenous Tasmanians called for by the Tasmanian Aboriginal community and its supporters, and has no expressed commitment to the current Federal policy of Aboriginal self-determination.</field><field name="date">1986</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">330104 Educational Policy, Administration and Management</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/2646</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/2646/1/Front_Morgan_Thesis.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/2646/2/Morgan_Thesis.pdf</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Study of Diesel-Hydrogen Fuel Mix in a Stationary Compression Engine</field><field name="creator">Hafez, HA</field><field name="description">The scarcity of fossil energy resources in conjunction with increasing demand has recently created record commodity price rises. Global warming and dimming are some of the harmful effects of increasing use of this resource. Furthermore, fossil fuel exhaust emissions, produced in internal combustion engines (ICE), generate significant health concerns. For decades, fears and numerous alarms have been raised regarding these problems. Many researchers believe that hydrogen would be an ideal alternative solution. Reduced fossil fuel consumption and lower thermal emanations (CO, CO2, HC and NO) are expected if hydrogen is used, as a principal or supplementary fuel, in standard ICE&#8217;s. However, hydrogen dual-fuel  use has historically been associated with injection and/or detonation problems. Direct injection (DI) strategy, in spark and compression engines, is commonly used to overcome some, but not all, of these difficulties. This experimental research investigated detonation free, diesel-hydrogen fuel consumptions, and exhaust emissions using an indirect injection (IDI) strategy in a generic compression diesel engine.
 A novel analogue Mechatronic Injection Unit (MICU) in conjunction with a multi point injection tactic (MPI) were devised to indirectly deliver low pressure hydrogen to a stationary Lister-Pitter diesel engine combustion chamber. The hydrogen injection system was created to be used as a generic dual-fuel kit. With off-the-shelf parts the MICU design was simple, robust, and purposeful in its function. The MICU component also formed an important element of a proposed innovative dual-fuel conversion kit. Nine hydrogen injection rates were tested. Diesel consumption savings were measured and the &#8216;effectiveness&#8217; of hydrogen vitiated injection was computed.
 The research outcomes demonstrated that with a conventional diesel mechanical governor and an assumed engine compression ratio of 15.5, detonation free combustion can be achieved with low pressure hydrogen vitiation  and enrichment . However, an injection rate limit existed above which detonation occurred. The study also demonstrated that through low pressure hydrogen vitiation and enrichment, diesel consumption savings were achieved. The research confirmed that the experimental fuel mass savings were lower than their expected/theoretical counterparts. The research particularly established that vitiation and enrichment effectiveness was only realised at low rather than high loads indicating that hydrogen achieved more than diesel mass substitutions.
 In this study a new confined area dual-fuel static emission testing procedure, coupled with an on-site use test cycle  was proposed and termed the Dual-fuel fixed speed emission-testing guideline. Dry thermal emissions were measured, and both the cycle average and median dry- and wet-emissions were computed, substance/species comparisons were performed and conclusions were drawn. The shortcomings of the procedure however were also highlighted.
 Finally, the research established that one action or measure, such as dual-fuel hydrogen vitiation and enrichment, can not address all the environment and health concerns. Contrary to the common belief, green house gases, nitrogen oxides, hydrocarbons and opacity substances do not coincidently all increase and/or decrease. Indeed, this experiment demonstrated that although the diesel-hydrogen nitrogen monoxide (NO) wet-emissions at all injection rates were partially lower than the diesel baseline, carbon oxides, hydrocarbon emissions, opacity (N) and absorption coefficients (k) were higher. In other words, a measure taken to limit the harm done to human health can increase the damage to the environment and vice versa.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">290903 Other Electronic Engineering</field><field name="subject">290501 Mechanical Engineering</field><field name="subject">291899 Interdisciplinary Engineering not elsewhere classified</field><field name="subject">291199 Environmental Engineering not elsewhere classified</field><field name="subject">299902 Combustion and Fuel Engineering</field><field name="subject">290502 Industrial Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/2781</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/2781/1/Hafez_PhD_abstract.pdf</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies on the nature of the pathogenicity of soil-borne Cylindrocarpon species</field><field name="creator">Sweetingham, MW</field><field name="description">A study was made of the association of Cylindrocarpon species with the below-ground portions of a range of plants in Tasmania, and of the pathogenic effects of members of the genus.
 A selective medium was developed to enhance the recovery of Cylindrocarpon species from soil and plant tissue. Several species were isolated from the root surfaces of a range of apparently healthy woody and herbaceous plants. Cylindrocarpon species were also isolated from the discoloured vascular tissue in the basal stem portion of several diseased woody plant species. C. destructans was the most frequently isolated species, but C. didymum, C. obtusisporum, C. tenue, C. theobromicola, C. candidum and an undescribed species were also recorded. The cultural characteristics and morphology of the isolates were described.
 Most of the Cylindrocarpon isolates produced either the metabolite brefeldin A or radicicol when cultured on Czapek Dox medium. The non host-specific phytotoxicity of brefeldin A was confirmed and the spectrum of its antifungal activity was also examined.
 A brefeldin A producing strain of C. destructans was consistently isolated from the discoloured wood in the base of the trunks of mature grapevines suffering from a dieback disease. The xylem vessels and functional phloem became blocked with tyloses and gum and fungal hyphae were visible in the ray cells of the diseased tissue. No other potential pathogens were isolated from the diseased tissue. Field observations suggested that the waterlogging of the trunks at groundlevel was necessary for the disease to develop. A waterlogging stress was required for the fungus to reproduce the characteristic disease symptoms on inoculated six-month-old vine cuttings. However, brefeldin A was not detected in naturally diseased grapevine tissue and could not be demonstrated to have a role in this disorder.
 Certain brefeldin A producing strains of Cylindrocarpon were capable of parasitizing the root cortex of radiata pine seedlings under steriIe conditions, causing a suppression in root growth. Radiata pine seed germinated in the presence of brefeldin A similarly produced stunted roots. Likewise, the growth of strawberry plants was significantly reduced, in the absence of other disease symptoms, when grown in sterilised soil amended with a brefeldin A producing isolate of C. destructans. This effect was reproduced by growing strawberry plants in soil amended with brefeldin A. Brefeldin A was absorbed by the strawberry roots and translocated into the shoots.
 All the CyIindrocarpon isolates were shown to produce a spectrum of pectin degrading isoenzymes when cultured on appropriate media. Inoculation experiments showed several Cylindrocarpon species were capable of producing "soft rot" type lesions on carrot roots. Several species could also infect the hypocotyl of radiata pine seedlings in sterile media, causing post emergence damping-off. Pectin lyase enzymes were detected in the lesions from both carrot roots and radiate pine hypocotyls and may be responsible for the tissue maceration. However, virulence of the isolates was not related to pectin lyase production in vitro.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">270403 Plant Pathology</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/3136</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/3136/1/1_front_Cylindrocarpon.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/3136/2/2_chap1_Cylindrocarpon.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/3136/3/3_chap2_Cylindrocarpon.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/3136/4/4_chap3-1_Cylindrocarpon.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/3136/5/5_chap3-2_Cylindrocarpon.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/3136/6/6_chap3-3_Cylindrocarpon.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/3136/7/7_chap3-4_Cylindrocarpon.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/3136/8/8_chap3-5_Cylindrocarpon.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/3136/9/9_chap4_Cylindrocarpon.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/3136/10/91_bib-app_Cylindrocarpon.pdf</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Spatial organisation and habitat selection patterns of three marsupial herbivores within a patchy forestry environment</field><field name="creator">le Mar, K</field><field name="description">In order to understand the ecology of species, it is important to know how animals use their environment. This information can be determined at a range of spatial and temporal scales, and results may vary accordingly. The habitats that animals use determine resources available to them for different purposes (e.g. feeding and resting), and risks of predation to which they are exposed. Consequently, patterns of behaviour in relation to the environment are likely to influence survival and fitness. In Tasmania, Australia, three common and widely distributed native marsupial herbivores are the red-necked or Bennett's wallaby (Macropus rufogriseus rufogriseus), the red-bellied pademelon (Thylogale billardierii) and the common brushtail possum (Trichosurus vulpecula). Information on the behaviour of these species in relation to their environment is largely unavailable.
 
 This thesis describes the abundance, spatial organisation and habitat selection patterns of these three species, within a patchy forestry landscape. The five major habitat types within this environment were: (1) a prepared site that was planted with commercial Eucalyptus nitens seedlings during the study (referred to as 'young plantation'); (2) 5-7 year old E. nitens plantation; (3) grassland; (4) native forest; and (5) harvested uncleared land.
 
 Patterns of habitat use and selection were examined at three sequential spatio-temporal scales, within a hierarchy of decisions. These were: (1) location of home-range within the landscape, (2) feeding area within the home-range, and (3) vegetation consumed within one habitat, the young plantation. A radio-telemetry study of Bennett's wallabies, pademelons and possums was used to examine Scales 1 and 2 at the individual animal level. Animal surveys were carried out to examine Scale 2 for the entire herbivore community at the population level. These data were also used to estimate herbivore densities for the overall area and individual habitats. Fenced and unfenced vegetation plots, located within the young plantation, a highly used habitat, were monitored over time to examine Scale 3.
 
 As part of this research, modifications to common line-transect sampling methods were made. These enabled methods that are usually applied to daytime surveys in open habitat, to be used in nocturnal surveys in densely vegetated habitats. Accuracy testing of the radiotelemetry system is also described, as the patchiness of the landscape required careful interpretation of results.
 
 Results showed that, at night, wallabies and pademelons used all habitats, but consistently selected for open habitats (young plantation and grassland) across spatio-temporal scales. The use of these open habitats for feeding was confirmed by the large biomass of grass and forbs consumed by herbivores in a detailed study of vegetation on the young plantation. These patterns are consistent with their feeding strategies of grazer or mixed-feeder.
 
 During the day, the two macropod species avoided open habitats and showed strong selection for closed habitats. Wallabies selected for older plantation, while pademelons selected for native forest. This difference reflects their respective predator avoidance strategy (crypsis for pademelons) or escape response (flight for wallabies). Although shelter habitat was important to the two macropod species, their lack of selection at the home-range scale was suggested to reflect the fact that resting animals require little space.
 
 Patterns of habitat use and selection were difficult to interpret for possums, because results varied between the spatio-temporal scales. Spotlighting data showed that at night, possums selected for native forest, young plantation and particularly grassland at the population level. Radio-collared animals selected only for native forest. Older E. nitens plantations were avoided by possums at every level, and appeared to represent a biological desert to this species.
 
 High overall densities of wallabies and pademelons (0.3 and 1.5 animals.ha-1, respectively), and small, round, home-ranges (61.6 ha and 22.3 ha, respectively) suggested that these species benefited from the patchiness of this environment. This is attributed to the highly heterogeneous habitats, providing complimentary resources in the absence of ecotones or transitional flora zones, existing side by side, over a small spatial scale. In contrast, extremely low possum population density (0.04 animals.ha-1) and very large home-ranges (39.1 ha) suggested that resources, presumably den sites and/or food, were limited within this forestry environment.
 
 Results on the ecological aspects of the three herbivore species, described above, are put in the context of the Tasmanian forestry industry, particularly in relation to management of herbivore browsing damage to planted seedlings. Based on this work, I suggest that future management strategies could involve: (1) reducing fragmentation of the natural environment, which supports small home-ranges and high macropod densities, by designing larger, rounder plantations; (2) considering the placement of plantations in relation to the proximity of open (feeding grounds) and closed (shelter) habitats; (3) reducing or removing windrows from newly established plantations to restrict pademelons to the plantation edge; (4) deliberately retaining groundcover or using cover crops to provision herbivores with an alternative food source, as grasses and herbaceous dicots are eaten in preference to Eucalyptus nirens seedlings; (5) recognising that wallabies and pademelons remove a large biomass of groundcover and therefore, could play a positive role in weed control, reducing the need to herbicide plantations; (6) monitoring newly planted plantations at short and regular time intervals so that damage caused by insects versus mammals can be differentiated; and (7) avoiding planting in winter when macropods may have little alternative food to eat on newly established plantations.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">270503 Animal Anatomy and Histology</field><field name="subject">270704 Landscape Ecology</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/3137</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/3137/1/1_front_le-Mar.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/3137/18/96_appendices_le-Mar%5B1%5D.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/3137/17/WholeThesis.pdf</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Nesting Habitat Preferences of Snow Petrels

 ecosystems, especially in a climate change context. There is a need to complement
 long&#8211;term temporal demographic information obtained at a limited number of
 monitoring sites with spatial distribution data.
 Systematic surveys of snow petrels and Wilson&#8217;s storm petrels were undertaken at
 Casey (2002-2003) and Mawson (2004-2005) in order to provide better regional
 population estimates and test the performance of predictive distribution models based
 on topographic and substrate variables for refining such estimates. As habitat selection
 modelling is rarely used in Antarctic regions, methodological developments focus on
 dealing with the peculiarities of a semi-colonial hollow-nesting species, testing habitat
 selection modelling approaches and comparing the output of four types of models
 (Generalized Linear and Generalized Additive Models, Classification Trees and
 Ecological Niche Factor Analysis) across a range of scales.
 Snow petrel nest distribution was directly related to the nature of the rock substrate
 and to major topographic/geomorphological parameters such as hill slope and the
 direction of the prevailing winds. Model performance varied with the scale at which
 models were implemented, suggesting that nest selection processes happen
 predominantly at the habitat unit and individual nest scales. Further study at the nest
 scale highlighted that the influence of biotic related parameters such as conspecific
 attraction (modelled as autocorrelation due to coloniality) may be of lesser influence
 than selection based on individual nest quality. An alternative modelling method,
 ENFA, which creates environmental envelopes for the niche of the species with
 presence data only was identified as valuable for Antarctic data sets, which often lack
 comprehensive records of species absence.
 The validation of the models created at Casey with nest data collected in the Mawson
 region returned satisfactory prediction rates in two different habitat types, coastal
 islands and inland mountains, suggesting that it may be possible to predict snow petrel
 distribution across East Antarctica using remotely sensed information on topography
 and geomorphology, for example high-resolution aerial photography to guide in the
 design of and complement ground surveys.
 Similar modelling procedures applied to Wilson&#8217;s storm petrels produced more
 mitigated results and selection for this species appeared to be based principally on nest
 microhabitat characteristics. However, modelling provided useful information on the
 large-scale habitat preferences and ecological requirements of both species</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">270500 Zoology</field><field name="subject">260000 Earth Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/3584</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/3584/1/Front_Matter.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/3584/4/FredOlivierPhDThesisFinal.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/3584/3/Appendix.pdf</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modern and recent seafloor environments (sedimentary, foraminiferal and Ostracode) of the Pitt Water Estuary, south-east Tasmania</field><field name="creator">Lewis, D</field><field name="description">The Pitt Water Estuary is a shallow, barrier estuary, with typically normal marine salinity, which has been subject to considerable anthropogenic modification. Modern seafloor environments were described using the distribution of sedimentary facies and foraminiferal and ostracod assemblages, examined from surficial sediment samples. Ten sedimentary facies were identified by grouping sediment samples using particle-size distribution data and lithic sand content. Faunal assemblages were identified by cluster analysis, with twelve sample, and eight species associations defined by foraminifera, and eight sample, and six species associations defined by Ostracoda.
  The distribution of sedimentary facies varies, firstly, with the upstream change in relative current energy (tidal versus fluvial) as reflected by the relative proportion of quartzose to lithic sand in sediment; and, secondly, with the water depth variation in current strength, as reflected by the sand grain size and mud content. The distribution and composition of foraminiferal and ostracod assemblages is determined mainly by average salinity and pH. The position of species along the axis of the estuary correlates with the altered salinity profile inferred to occur during floods, with tolerance to lowered salinity being greater further upstream. Low pH conditions are widely distributed (due to the anoxia of stagnant, nutrient-enriched waters), causing calcareous test dissolution which, in some areas, totally excludes calcareous foraminifera and ostracods. Illumination is also important in controlling ostracod distribution, being lowest in widespread turbid waters. Additional factors controlling foraminiferal and ostracod distribution include: substrate mobility, nutrients, seagrass distribution, tidal exposure, and tolerance to varying temperature. 
  Recent seafloor environments were described using the distribution of sediments, foraminifera and ostracods in short cores and previous spatial surveys. They have changed considerably since the late 19th century, mainly as a result of human activities which continue to affect the estuary.   
  During periods of increased agricultural activity (1920&#8217;s-1940s; 1960&#8217;s-present), greater land clearance, cultivation and fertiliser usage within the catchment area lead to increased sediment and nutrient loading of fluvial waters entering the estuary. This lead to increased sedimentation, mud accumulation, turbidity, and lowered dissolved oxygen and pH within the estuary, causing the demise of dense clam and oyster beds, reduced distribution of ostracods and calcareous foraminifera, increased distribution of agglutinated foraminifera, and increased faunal abundance within nutrient-enriched sediments. Dam construction and irrigation activities during the 20th century, reduced rainfall over the last thirty years, and causeway construction during the 1870&#8217;s, have all contributed to increased water stagnation, reduced flushing, and more upstream penetration of the estuary by marine waters.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">270702 Marine and Estuarine Ecology (incl.

 people migrate. This has lead many migration researchers to search for lists of causal
 factors understood to influence migration decisions. More recent migration research
 has come to recognize that to understand why people migrate, it is important to look
 beyond such lists and attempt to provide a more complex and nuanced account of the
 migration process. This thesis draws upon these more recent studies and begins with
 the premise that to begin to answer the question of why people migrate, one must first
 try to comprehend how people negotiate, experience and understand their migrations.
 Through a study of the return migration of young adults to the state of Tasmania in
 Australia, this thesis discusses the utility of the concepts of 'mobility' and 'place' for
 exploring the complexities of people's negotiations, experiences and understandings
 of migration. Interviews and focus groups were conducted with thirty young adults
 (aged between twenty and thirty-eight) who had left Tasmania and subsequently
 returned. The thesis speaks to discussions surrounding the emigration of young adults
 and concerns about 'brain drain' occurring in many regions in Australia as well as
 internationally. The choice of Tasmania as a case study for this research is highly
 appropriate, as concerns surrounding the out-migration of young people from the
 state have influenced the State's social, economic and political life since the early
 1900s. By examining return migration, the focus is shifted away from discourses that
 bemoan the negative effects of the emigration of young adults, instead recognising
 that migration can also bring benefits to both young migrants themselves and to the
 places they move between.
 The research found that people's experiences of migration were intricately tied to
 their negotiations and understandings of places. Through a complex analysis of
 constructions of mobility, place and belonging, the thesis reveals that young
 Tasmanians retain deep emotional and social connections to Tasmania at all stages of
 the migration process. These connections are influenced by constructions of
 Tasmania as a place that is understood simultaneously as 'bounded and insular' and
 as 'networked'. The thesis concludes by pointing to the implications of both mobility
 and place construction for the politics and economies of the places migrants move
 between, as well as for the practical considerations and identity constructions of the
 migrants themselves, and reasserts the importance of these concepts for studies of
 migration.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">370502 Migration</field><field name="subject">370402 Social and Cultural Geography</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/3269</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/3269/1/1_easthope-front-matter.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/3269/2/2_easthope-intro-chp1.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/3269/3/3_easthope-chp2-3.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/3269/4/4_easthope-chp4.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/3269/5/5_easthope-chp5-6.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/3269/6/6_easthope-chp7-on.pdf</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Robotic Vision By Using Bee Algorithm</field><field name="creator">Zhou, L</field><field name="description">With the development of technologies, robots have played an important role in many

 geometry, the converging slot-hole or console. Both the thermal and aerodynamic
 performance were measured, using the adiabatic effectiveness and heat transfer
 coefficient, and aerodynamic loss respectively, to quantify performance. Comparative
 measurements were made, by testing conventional film cooling hole shapes in parallel
 with the console experiments. The CFD code, Fluent, was used to predict the performance
 of the initial design concept before it was manufactured.
 Initial performance measurements in incompressible flow were performed in a low speed
 wind tunnel at an engine representative Reynolds number based on mainstream flow and
 hole diameter. For these experiments, the coolant to mainstream density ratio was
 approximately unity, and the cooling performance was measured over a flat plate. The
 console was tested in parallel with cylindrical holes, a slot and fan-shaped holes, all of
 which had equal throat area per unit width. The heat transfer performance was measured at
 steady state using thermochromic liquid crystals sprayed onto a flat plate heater. The
 aerodynamic performance of the holes was measured by traversing the boundary layer 50
 cylindrical hole diameters downstream of the injection location with a pitot probe.
 Engine representative measurements of the console performance were made in a transonic
 annular cascade that simulates the three-dimensional flow in the gas turbine. The
 Reynolds and Mach numbers were representative of engine conditions, and the coolant
 flow was made aerodynamically and thermodynamically similar to engine conditions by
 matching both the momentum flux and density ratios. This was achieved by using a heavy
 foreign gas with the composition of 30.2% SF6 and 69.8% Ar by weight, which simulates
 the coolant to mainstream density ratio of 1.78, and has a ratio of specific heats of 1.4. The
 performance of a nozzle guide vane with rows of fan-shaped holes was compared with an
 NGV with a film cooling configuration designed with rows of consoles replacing rows of
 fan-shaped holes. The heat transfer performance was measured using a modified step
 change transient liquid crystal technique. The aerodynamic performance was measured
 using a four hole probe traverse downstream of the NGV.
 The heat transfer performance of the console was found to be similar to or slightly lower
 than the performance of fan-shaped holes. The most significant benefit of the console was
 found to be the aerodynamic performance, with a loss due to film cooling of only 20% of
 the loss due to film cooling of the rows of fan-shaped holes measured at engine
 representative conditions.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">290299 Aerospace Engineering not elsewhere classified</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/3363</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/3363/1/Front_MatterJES%5B1%5D.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/3363/2/ThesisJES%5B1%5D.pdf</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Quantitative genetics. of
 Eucalyptus globulus, E. nitens and
 their F1 'hybrid</field><field name="creator">Volker, PW</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the quantitative genetics of intra- and inter-specific
 hybrids of E. globzllus ssp. globl~lus and E. nitens. The trials established to make
 this study are unique in forestry, due to the fact that the same parents have
 been used in open-pollination, intra- and inter-provenance (or intra-species)
 crosses and inter-species F1 hybrids. This has allowed direct comparison of
 genetic parameters derived from different cross types. The traits examined
 include frost resistance using an electrical conductivity method, growth
 (diameter at breast height over bark DBHOB, at ages 2, 3, 4, 6 and 10 years)
 and Pilodyn penetration at age 6 years as an indirect measure of wood density.
 The results demonstrate that the measured performance of frost, growth and
 Pilodyn traits in the inter-specific Fi hybrid E. nitens x globulus is always
 intermediate or comparable with one or other of the parent species. In the
 frost trait, the inter-specific hybrid was no better than the frost sensitive E.
 globulus, so there is no overall advantage in producing the hybrid for this trait.
 Negative mid-parent heterosis was observed for early age growth traits in
 inter-specific E. nitens x globulus FI hybrids involving Taranna E. globulus male
 parents. The inter-specific FI hybrids demonstrated generally poor survival
 and a high proportion of abnormal and slow growing phenotypes, which
 eventually died. This latter phenomenon was not evident in pure species
 crosses, either within or between provenances.
 It is shown that in E. globulus open-pollinated progeny estimates of additive
 genetic parameters are inflated and that breeding values for growth in E.
 globulus are poorly estimated, possibly due to the confounding effects of
 variation in inbreeding. This was not the case for traits of high heritability
 such as Pilodyn. Within the E. nitens population studied, open-pollinated
 estimates compared well with control-pollinated estimates for all traits.
 Genetic parameter estimates from control-pollinated progeny indicate low
 heritability for growth in E. globulus which diminish over time. Dominance
 effects were low and comparable with additive genetic effects but were site
 specific. In E. nitens heritability for growth is moderate to high, tending to
 increase over time with significantly low levels of dominance, which diminish
 over time. Pilodyn has low to moderate heritabilities with low levels of
 dominance in both species. Moderate levels of heritability were demonstrated
 for frost resistance in both species, but dominance effects could not be
 accurately estimated.
 The correlation of performance of parents in intia-specific crosses through
 their General Combining Ability (GCA) is compared with performance in
 inter-specific hybrids through General Hybridising Ability (GHA). It is shown
 that there is little or no correlation between GCA and GHA in inter-specific F1
 hybrids for growth or frost resistance, but there was a good correlation for
 Pilodyn. This indicates that, for growth and frost resistance, there may be
 different genes, which contribute to expression between species and these may
 not combine according to classical quantitative genetic theory. In contrast,
 within E. globulus there was very high correlation of within-provenance GCA
 with between-provenance GHA for growth and Pilodyn, indicating the same
 genes are acting within the species, regardless of provenance.
 It is demonstrated that standard quantitative genetic models do not cope
 adequately with inter-specific F1 hybrid populations for growth traits in this
 case. In addition, the implication for breeding and deployment of interspecific
 Fi hybrids is compromised by the lack of ability to predict
 performance of potential hybrid combinations from pure species performance
 of parents.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">270400 Botany</field><field name="subject">270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/3586</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/3586/2/Front_Matter.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/3586/1/Volker__Thesis.pdf</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Investigation into the Ontological Significance of Sculptural Objects</field><field name="creator">Langridge, C</field><field name="description">The research is developed through sculptural artworks that seek to raise
 the question of their being. They do this through their indeterminate
 presence, which often awakens people to ask &#8216;What is it?&#8217; I ask how
 sculpture can encourage people to wonder about what things are, and
 how the relationship/s we form with art can then lead us to reflect upon
 our other more worldly relationships. I also pursue the questions of what
 is sculpture, and what is contemporary art, in order to map out an
 understanding of the domain of my practice, and the issues at stake
 regarding the making and display of sculpture.
 Through a reading of the ideas of Martin Heidegger and other
 Continental philosophers, I have focused upon the way our (Modern
 Western) relationship with things in the world is problematic, and how
 art can help us to address some of these problems. It is through art&#8217;s
 poetic ambiguities that our usual determined and closed relationship with
 the world can be opened up to other readings. An investigation into
 contemporary art practices reveals several issues that put the artwork
 into context and shed light upon difficulties facing contemporary artists
 particularly in terms of: what am I to do, why should I do it and how
 should I proceed?
 My artworks are aimed at raising questions for the viewer about being,
 sculpture and contemporary art. I have developed the coopering
 technique of wooden construction to make unusually shaped wooden
 container-like sculptures. I have also investigated other semi-industrial
 working methods to construct sculptural objects that oscillate between
 various possibilities for the viewer. These artworks operate in the field
 between the familiar/unfamiliar, functional/non-functional and the
 known/unknown. They resist the viewer&#8217;s efforts at stilling the
 oscillation between possible readings and evade some of the common
 roles of contemporary art such as being a site for social and political
 dialogue or being a reflection of contemporary/pop/consumer culture.
 This project contributes to the dialogue already in play between several
 Post-Minimal sculptors whose work touches upon constructed and or
 manufactured ambiguous forms. It further develops the language of how
 to discuss these issues through my philosophical readings. It extends the
 coopering technique beyond the simple cask form to discover the
 technical possibilities for this method of construction. It brings to the
 gallery visitor an actual experience of what Heidegger writes about art,
 particularly in terms of his ideas about &#8216;the truth of being as
 revealing/concealing&#8217;. The research also develops our understanding of
 the nature of contemporary art through questioning several aspects of it
 and through adopting outmoded and laborious methods of making that
 are at odds with our digital age. The artworks are the result of working
 toward a position of indeterminacy that is alluring, by partially resisting
 the viewer&#8217;s efforts to know them.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">410401 Design Theory</field><field name="subject">410200 Visual Arts and Crafts</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/3587</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/3587/2/Begininng_to_PhD.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.utas.edu.au/3587/1/Final__PhD.pdf</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Management strategies for an input

 of fishing effort is continually increasing so that past effort reductions have been
 fully offset by improved efficiencies. In fact, some past effort reductions did not actually
 lead to a real reduction in effective effort. As a consequence of this, there was no recovery
 in the size of the tiger prawn resource but rather, in some years, a decline, until a major

 value of the wood products they source. Certain species of the fungal genus
 Mycosphaerella are a concern in eucalyptus plantations around the world.
 Mycosphaerella leaf disease (referred to as MLD from here in) can cause significant
 leaf necrosis, discolouration and defoliation. In Australia severe outbreaks of MLD
 have been observed in various eucalyptus plantations. The three aspects of MLD
 research targeted in this Thesis were factors influencing its atmospheric ascospore
 concentrations, the effect of its symptoms on leaf spectral properties, and the use of
 remote sensing to detect MLD&#8217;s symptom distribution and severity.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">300699 Forestry
